The Carlson Centennial Scholars Program named in honor of the school's 100th year and funded by just 15 generous donors will award recurring scholarships to at least 75 new students per year. The awards are renewable lasting for up to four years for undergraduates and for the entirety of graduate students' programs.

""It's about bringing in and retaining the best and the brightest"" Carlson School Dean Sri Zaheer said. ""We are very very keen on getting more underrepresented students into our program.""

The first cohort of 34 scholars was enrolled last fall. Nearly 75% of them are women and about 40% are students of color.

Carlson School administrators select students for the program based on factors that include academics diversity leadership and financial need.

The new fund will generate about $2.25 million in scholarships per year Zaheer said adding to some $2.5 million in philanthropic scholarships the school already gives out annually.

Undergraduates selected for the program will receive an average scholarship of $7500 per year totaling about $30000 in aid over their four years said Travis Smith Carlson's assistant dean for institutional advancement.

Graduate students will receive a higher annual award sum.

""The intention is to fully meet their financial need"" Smith said.

All Carlson School students are required to study abroad before graduating. Students in the Centennial Scholars Program will receive a stipend to help pay for this in addition to their scholarship aid. They also will receive specialized programming. The first cohort of students was put through a leadership program administrators said.

Students in the program must maintain a 2.0 GPA or higher to keep their scholarships a Carlson School spokesman said.

The donors who funded the program include Best Buy 3M the Carlson Family Foundation and several philanthropists.

""Centennial Scholar students will be supported to elevate their academic and professional experiences and enter the workforce ready to embody business as a force for good"" donors John and Nancy Lindahl said in a statement.

Zaheer and Smith believe the new scholarship fund will give Carlson an edge over some of the best business schools in the country when vying to recruit top students.

""These types of deals are quite rare"" Smith said.

AOS,A O Smith,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRheXRvbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2FyY2hkZWFjb24tZmFtaWx5LWdvZXMtZnJvbS10aXBwLWNpdHktdG8tdGluc2VsdG93bi9DWU9QRkZNTVU1Q1QzTDRLWE9LRzJMVVg2TS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Archdeacon: Family goes from Tipp City to Tinseltown,"“It was my first date ever” said Holly Wampler who back in those Tipp City days was Holly Swisher.

“I was 14 and Chris was 16. We double dated with two of our friends and went to the Englewood Cinema to see “Mr. Mom.” Then we went to the Pizza Hut.

“I’d first met Chris in the fourth grade when we moved to Tipp City from Trotwood. I thought he was cute right away.”

The pair were an on-again off-again couple as they went through high school and their start in colleges across town from each other.

Chris played basketball at Wright State and Holly like much of the rest of her family went to the University of Dayton and was a cheerleader. By Chris’ junior year they were back together for good.

“I won the lottery that day we got connected” he said the other day as he was making his early morning commute from the family’s home in Burbank California to Santa Ana where he’s the head of the finance team at Ducommun Inc. “Ever since then I’ve enjoyed staring at my winning ticket – my wife my kids and the whole situation.”

And when he’s looking at his kids – Carrie Phillip and Christina who’s known as Cricket – he very well may be seeing them on a TV show in a movie or a commercial.

All three are young actors with an ever-growing list of credits.

Carrie who’s 24 has the deepest resume. She had a significant role in the movie “The Yellow Birds” which starred Jennifer Anniston Alden Ehrenreich and Tye Sheridan. She was in the HBO series “Big Little Lies” which featured Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman and has appeared in other movies and several TV shows.

Phillip is a 22-year-old actor with a growing interest in writing and directing. He debuted in the 2013 movie “Last Vegas” starring Robert De Niro Michael Douglas Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline. Just recently he finished a writing program at UCLA and he’s directed his own short film “Saved by Daylight.”

But the brightest spotlight right now shines on 20-year-old Cricket who is one of the stars of the new TV show “Big Shot” which is streaming on Disney+. It stars John Stamos as a mercurial college basketball coach who was fired from his job for one too many blow-ups and ends up coaching at an elite all-girls high school where Cricket is one of his players.

Chris – who coached Tipp City High School to a 68-44 record in five seasons in the late 1990s – thinks Stamos has done “a great job” portraying a coach:

“He’s some kind of cross between Bobby Knight with his actions and Rick Pitino with his looks and demeanor.”

He gives Cricket – who did play two seasons on an all-boys hoops team at a local YMCA – high marks as well.

Along with her acting and dancing chops she brings some impressive sports genes to her role.

Chris – who was an All-Ohio player for Frank Goldsberry at Tipp City – averaged over 20 points a game as a junior and a senior.

Although recruited by Yale he chose Wright State – then coached by Ralph Underhill and Jim Brown – and several years later spent six seasons as the color commentator for radio broadcasts of Raiders games.

Cricket’s maternal grandfather the late John Swisher was the scorekeeper for UD basketball games in the mid-1960s. He’s in the Greater Dayton Baseball Hall of Fame and was a football coach a Meadowdale High School. He and his wife Merrily who still lives in Tipp City were longtime basketball season ticket holders at UD just as Chris’ late parents Phil and Pat had WSU tickets.

And then there are Cricket’s first cousins: Justin Ahrens the 6-foot-6 long-range shooter for Ohio State and his older brother Kyle also 6-6 who played 117 games for the Michigan State Spartans.

“I’m lucky that I’ve had so much basketball around me already” Cricket said the other day. “But with my dad and cousins watching I’ve tried not to stress about it and I think I’ve gotten their stamp of approval.”

Chris said their current life – three kids pursing acting and directing careers and the family relocated to the Los Angeles area – “came out of left field. Holly and I were these Midwestern kids who grew up in sports families.”

‘Life is a journey’

Actually the whole adventure began on something of a fluke Holly said:

“When we were living in Tipp City my mom would bring over these article from the newspaper for me to see.

“One morning she left one on the table about someone’s daughter getting married. But I looked on the wrong side of the paper and read about a modelling and acting expo they were having in Huber Heights. The hook was an appearance by one of the stars of a Disney show our kids watched.

“Carrie always had an interest in the Disney shows so when heard one of the stars was coming in she said ‘I want to meet that girl and she could tell me how to be an actor.’”

Phillip went along and he and Carrie started taking acting classes in Huber Heights where it soon was suggested they attend a national expo in Dallas. The kids’ talents were noticed there but the Wamplers were told they needed to move to Los Angeles for their children to really break into the business.

“At first it seemed so far-fetched and some of our family and I’m sure people in town thought it was the craziest thing they’d ever heard” Holly said.

After considerable debate the family began the “journey” that saw Holly moving to California with Carrie and Phillip for parts of three years (2008-11) to try to get a toehold.

It was a herculean challenge. Initially they lived in a hotel and Holly home schooled the kids while also taking them to auditions – sometimes seven or eight a day – and helping them learn their lines.

A major problem was her reluctance to drive on the L.A. freeways. But they found a godsend in Miles and Peggy Shearer who had gone to Fairview High School in Dayton with her parents and now lived in L.A. They chauffeured Holly and the kids in those early days.

At first Cricket – who was shy and had shunned any overtures to try acting herself – stayed in Tipp City with Chris who was a certified accountant with A.O. Smith Electrical Products.

But on her first L.A. visit Cricket – then a fourth grader at L T Ball Intermediate School – had a change of heart when her siblings’ manager asked her again.

“I think I shocked them all when I said ‘Yeah I want to try it” Cricket laughed.

“She never went back home after that” Holly said.

With the rest of his family “all in” as he put it Chris said he found himself at a crossroads when A O Smith was sold:

“Tipp City was the right place for Holly and me for 40 to 45 years but for the last 12 to 15 years L.A. has been the right place for our family.

“Like I said ‘Life is a journey’ and you need to celebrate it when and where you can.”

Still connected to Miami Valley

Chris said his family has approached this venture as a team – pulling for each other to succeed – and in so doing they use many of the concepts he learned from a lifetime around basketball.

Although he’d grown up at Dayton Flyers fan he said Wright State was a “terrific school” for him. He was on the team when the program elevated to the NCAA Division I level and he started all 28 games in his final 1989-90 season.

One of his favorite memories is the Raiders’ 101-99 win over the Flyers at a sold-out UD Arena his senior year.

“I knew we weren’t going to knock them off their mantle in terms of their storied history their athletic lore and their following” he said. “They’re still one of the top 20 places to watch a game and that’s for all the right reasons. They have a fabulous program.

“But for that one night on the road in the Arena we walked into their house and gave them more than just a run for their money. We got ‘em!

“We surprised a lot of people that night and I think it was important for our program and the perception of it.”

In 2006 he became the broadcast partner of Chris Collins the play-by-play announcer for Raiders games. It was coach Brad Brownell’s first year as well and Chris called it “a magical season” as WSU went 23-10 and made the NCAA Tournament for just the second time as a D-I program.

Even today in California he said he and his family listen to the broadcasts of Raiders games by Collins and his former coach Jim Brown. And when they make one of their may visits back home they try to see a Raiders game and one at UD too.

“We haven’t lost those connections and influences from our past” Chris said.

He said one Midwestern trait that their children have fully embraced is a real work ethic.

“But what impresses me most is their resilience their confidence their ability to hear the word ‘No’ and still say ‘That’s OK let’s move on to the next audition the next role’” he said.

“I don’t know if I could do it like that. When you play sports you like to feel you’re succeeding more than you’re failing. It’s different in this business.

“But they’ve kept the right attitude and I give all the credit in the world for that to Holly.”

And that has made the successes that much sweeter.

He remembers the first breakthrough actually came with Cricket. She would be in the first of some 45 commercials the Wamplers have appeared in:

“I was still back in Tipp City watching 60 Minutes and all of a sudden it went to break and I see Cricket pop on the screen in a Sears commercial. At that moment it was still surreal. I was like ‘What just happened?’”

But now as the appearances in TV shows and movies have accumulated he said from “an out of body experience” to feeling “OK this is some semblance of normal now.”

He started to laugh:

“And you think ‘This is pretty cool.’”

‘It was just like going to the movies’

While Chris makes his daily 55-mile commute – which can take anywhere from 75 minutes to 2 ½ hours one way – Holly is back in Burbank the cornerstone of the children’s acting efforts.

On the morning we spoke she was about to bring some clothes to Carrie who had an audition at NBC that would be followed by a photo shoot.

When Cricket landed the role of Samantha “Giggles” Finkman in Big Shot she had no idea the COVID pandemic was about to hit and with the continued shutdowns and pauses that followed it would take a year and a half to finish filming the season.

The show debuted April 16 and is getting good reviews.

Even in these COVID times they were able to have a premier atop the parking garage of The Grove shopping and entertainment complex in Beverly Hills.

“Because of the protocols they did it like a drive-in movie” Holly said. “Each cast member was allowed three cars with two people in them. They came and got Cricket for the red carpet and everybody else stayed in their cars and they brought you food and everything. It was actually a lot of fun.

“It was just like going to the movies.”

And that brings this story full circle.

After all it began at the Englewood Cinema 37 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ABT,Abbott,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvbWF0dGhldy1tY2NvbmF1Z2hleS10ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1ydW4tNDg4NTM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matthew McConaughey making calls as he weighs running for Texas governor,"Most political strategists say they doubt McConaughey a Texas native will sacrifice his status as a beloved cultural icon in the state for the dirty business of politics. They don’t see a viable path forward either pointing to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s backing among the business community and millions in the bank — but the state’s political class is keeping a close eye on the Hollywood star’s plans nonetheless.

“I find it improbable but it’s not out of the question” said top Republican strategist Karl Rove who relayed a recent encounter with Lawrence Wright describing the New Yorker journalist as “hyperventilating” at the prospect that his close friend and fellow Texan might run. (Asked for comment on McConaughey Wright replied in an email “I’m trying to lower my profile in this so I’ll politely decline.”)

Rumors have been swirling around a potential McConaughey run for months and the actor has been less than coy about his interest in politics and public leadership. Despite his superstardom McConaughey remains a Texas resident — he lives in Austin with his wife Camila and three children. He has become a kind of celebrity mascot for the state with his role in public service announcements during the coronavirus pandemic and his “just keep livin” foundation which works with young people and has raised millions for victims of the devastating ice storm that hit Texas. At his alma mater the University of Texas at Austin he has been named “Minister of Culture” and is professor of practice at the Moody College of Communication.

“I’m a little more surprised that people aren’t taking him more seriously honestly” said Brendan Steinhauser an Austin-based GOP strategist. “Celebrity in this country counts for a lot … it’s not like some C-list actor no one likes. He has an appeal.”

There’s little question that McConaughey — who became a household name for his starring roles in top films like “Dazed and Confused” and “Dallas Buyers Club” delivering memorable lines in his signature languid drawl — would draw national media attention should he enter the race against Abbott.

What’s less clear is what kind of platform McConaughey would run on or even which party banner he would run under. McConaughey has been peppered with questions about politics and news of the day while promoting his memoir “Greenlights” but overall has been vague about his political leanings saying little about specific issues or policies.

The political calculations for a decision about party affiliation would also be tricky.

“The question is: Would he run as a Republican? A Democrat? Independent? And where is he on the political scale? He says he has a funny phrase about being a hardcore centrist but what party would he run under?” said Rove.

A spokesperson for McConaughey did not comment on the record for the story.

Abbott 63 is planning to run for a third term and he has maintained support of Republican voters even after his shaky handling of the ice storm that wiped out the state’s electric grid and cost more than 100 lives. He already faces a primary challenger from the right wing of the party with former state Sen. Don Huffines who is running in the pugilistic style of Donald Trump. And there is speculation that Texas GOP chair Allen West and Sid Miller the current Texas agriculture commissioner will enter the race too. Still Abbott remains the overwhelming GOP favorite and over the years has built out a significant political machine that others would struggle to match.

A McConaughey run as an independent would likely strip both Democratic and Independent voters away and tip the scales in favor of Abbott.

“The problem with running as an independent is we have seen this movie before” said longtime Democratic strategist Paul Begala pointing to Gov. Rick Perry’s 2006 win.

Back then quirky singer-songwriter Kinky Friedman and former Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn ran as independents and while they finished behind Perry and Democratic candidate Chris Bell they still managed to pull in 12 and 18 percent of the vote respectively — votes Democrats say were pulled away from Bell. A Democrat has not been governor of Texas since Ann Richards 26 years ago.

“Texas doesn’t need a third party Matthew! We need a second party” Begala said.

Meanwhile the Democratic Party has no announced candidate as of yet. Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke whose 2018 Senate run against Ted Cruz vaulted him into national prominence and a failed presidential bid has yet to make a decision about whether or not he enters the race.

Former HUD Secretary and fellow 2020 hopeful Julián Castro is another potential candidate.

“He hasn’t ruled anything out and we’re watching the race closely” said Sawyer Hackett executive director of Castro’s People First Future PAC.

Gilberto Hinojosa the chair of the Texas Democratic Party said that if McConaughey chose to run on their ticket he would “welcome him.”

“He’s young good-looking smart and has a little wildness — but this is Texas. We like that stuff” Hinojosa said. “He has not reached out to the party that I know of. It’s absolutely up in the air.”

But Hinojosa cautioned “If he wants to run as an independent he’d be a spoiler and guarantee Abbott gets elected.”

McConaughey’s recent conversations according to one person familiar with them came after the release of a poll of registered Texas voters by the Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler. Those polled gave McConaughey a double-digit lead over Abbott: Forty-five percent of Texas registered voters would vote for McConaughey 33 percent would vote for Abbott and 22 percent would vote for someone else.

For now vagueness is serving McConaughey just fine.

“Everybody loves you until you take a position. Right now you have a blank slate. You could go to a campaign event with him and get to meet a movie star but it’s a little different when he says he’s pro-life or pro-choice and there’s 50 other issues you could pick on that would have the same effect” said a senior Texas Republican operative. “There’s a difference between asking if it’s a good idea or really running.”

McConaughey has so far kept his political cards close to chest leaving operatives from the left and the right to speculate about which side of the aisle he’d land on. He has not made any political contributions to candidates and according to the Texas Tribune he has not voted in a Texas primary since 2012.

He is also likely to run into heightened skepticism about experience-free politicians in the aftermath of Trump’s tumultuous presidency.

“I think there’s an impression of ‘Do we really need another celebrity candidate in the midst of this?’” said Matthew Dowd founder of “Country Over Party” and former chief strategist on the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign.

Dowd also raised the prospect that serious scrutiny in the press could yield some tough embarrassing coverage for the free-living McConaughey. “I don’t know how beating bongo drums naked in your front yard goes over in rural Texas” he said.

Abbott remains the favorite in the state with a 77 percent approval rating among Republicans according to the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. And some Abbott allies shrugged off the idea of a Hollywood star without political experience swooping in and bumping Abbott from the governor’s mansion. Some movie stars lacking political experience such as Ashley Judd from Kentucky have flirted with the idea of running for office and in the end decided to sit out. But others such as Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger in California pulled it off in years past.

And McConaughey can flaunt an authenticity other celebrities often lack: He grew up in Uvalde a sparsely populated county in Texas’ famous hill country that was also home to other political heavyweights such as John Nance Garner who became FDR’s vice president and Dolph Briscoe a Democratic governor of Texas in the 1970s. He also has personal ties to the moneyed oil world in Texas: His brother Mike “Rooster” McConaughey is a self-made millionaire in Midland.

One Austin-based Republican operative said they’re not taking the McConaughey chatter too seriously — at least for now.

“If he starts a PAC gets a website that would be a real signal” said the Republican. “A lot of this seems like telephone chatter — one person passing it to another person.”

Still McConaughey has managed to capture the imagination of the state’s liberal punditry.

“Texas may not be ready for a philosopher king as a candidate much less governor but it sure would be fun to watch Mr. McConaughey debate Mr. Abbott and ambush him with a sensible line like this one from ‘Greenlights': ‘I’ve found that a good plan is to first recognize the problem then stabilize the situation organize the response then respond’ wrote Mimi Swartz the executive editor of Texas Monthly for an op-ed in The New York Times this week.

When asked about the response to her article Swartz emailed “A lot of people seemed to think yeah why the hell not?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmlyZ2luaWEucml2YWxzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FiYm90dC1zLWh1Z2UtbmlnaHQtcHJvcGVscy11dmEtdG8tc2V2ZW50aC1uby1oaXR0ZXItaW4tMTctMC13aW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott's Huge Night Propels UVa To Seventh No-hitter In 17-0 Win,"Coach Brian O'Connor needed to have a conversation with his left-handed ace.

Andrew Abbott hadn't allowed a hit in seven innings against Wake Forest Friday night and had struck out 15 of the 23 batters he had faced. But Abbott was at 99 pitches and his next turn in the rotation would be coming on shortened rest next Thursday at Boston College.

""I actually went down there after the seventh inning and told him he was done"" O'Connor revealed after Virginia's 17-0 win.

Abbott responded with a request.

""I was like 'Let me go out there'"" he said. ""'Let me get one more out and then you can take me out. I just want to walk and wave to the fans as my goodbye.'""

O'Connor and pitching coach Drew Dickinson acquiesced. Abbott notched one final strikeout extending his new career high to 16. As O'Connor made his way from the dugout UVa infielders gathered around Abbott at the mound and started hugging the senior. Teammates came out of the Virginia dugout and bullpen to join the fans at Disharoon Park for a standing ovation.

An emotional Abbott tipped his cap to the crowd as he left the field.

Freshman lefty Jake Berry recorded the final two outs of the eighth inning. Senior Griff McGarry worked around a one-out walk to strike out the side in the ninth. The three pitchers had combined for the seventh no-hitter in Virginia baseball history.

""Being able to close that out for Andrew definitely a very emotion-filled moment"" McGarry said afterward. ""We've been roommates the past three years and I'm glad I was able to do that and help him achieve such a big thing.""

As he was hitting his spots in the bullpen while warming up before the game Abbott had a sense that it could be a good night. He worked around a two-out walk to strike out the side in the first inning then he struck out the side in order in the second. By that point both Abbott and his coach knew he was as O'Connor put it ""on his really really good stuff” last night.

""His velocity was really good and he was executing his fastball up in the zone with two strikes"" O'Connor said. ""He's done that all year long it's been a really really great pitch for him. But you could see his command of his fastball was very very elite.""

""I was kind of thinking to myself 'Okay I've got my good stuff going. They're not picking it up'"" said Abbott. ""'So let's just keep it going for as long as I can.'""

Abbott's first eight outs were all strikeouts and by the end of the fourth inning he had recorded 11. With three more in the fifth Abbott had matched the career-high he'd already reached twice this season. One more to end the sixth gave him 15 the most for a UVa pitcher since Nathan Kirby struck out 18 in his no-hitter at Pitt on April 4 2014.

With his 16th strikeout to start the eighth inning Abbott matched Seth Greisinger's performance against North Carolina on March 23 1996 the third-highest total all-time for a Virginia pitcher. Harry Thomas set the UVa single-game record for strikeouts with 19 against Clemson on April 26 1974.

Abbott knew his night was done after that final strikeout. He admitted it was hard to keep back his emotions as he soaked in that final walk off the mound at Disharoon Park.

""Just kind of reminiscing kind of slowing down the heartbeat"" he said. “Saying okay I'm done. This is it for the Disharoon career. So just taking that breath in and then seeing the fans the standing ovation and stuff like that it's always hard to fight back tears.""

As O'Connor watched the scene unfold he thought back to last June when Abbott went unselected in the COVID-shortened MLB Draft. The lefty who spent his first three college seasons pitching primarily out of the bullpen returned to Virginia determined to prove he could be a starter. Friday's performance improved his record on the season to 6-5 and dropped his ERA to 3.12 with 115 strikeouts in 75 innings.

""He knew he could do it. He told me he could do it and I knew that he could"" O'Connor said.""He believed in himself and he went out there and worked hard and he earned it. So to see him be able to walk off the field like that at home is really really special.

""You wish there were 5000 people in the stands so so many people could enjoy it"" the head coach added.

After Berry finished off the Demon Deacons in the eighth O'Connor gave the ball to McGarry to get the game's final three outs. McGarry began the season slotted right behind Abbott in the weekend rotation but control issues cost him that role. Friday night marked his first appearance since failing to record an out in a start at VCU on April 20.

McGarry came out of the bullpen ""just trying to throw it right through (catcher) Kyle Teel."" He hit 99 on the radar gun as he struck out Michael Turconi for the first out. After a walk and another strikeout McGarry went ball-strike-ball-strike on Chris Lanzilli. Before his next pitch he paused to check the count and noticed the zero representing the Demon Deacons' hit count.

After a swing and a miss the celebration ensued.

""It was a rush of emotion and then my immediate thought was 'Where's Abbott? Where's Abbott?'"" McGarry recalled. ""I just wanted to give him a big hug.""

Afterward Abbott credited UVa’s offense for making his life easier with another big Friday night at the plate. The Wahoos got home runs from Brendan Rivoli and Zack Gelof as part of a 14-hit night. In Abbott's last six starts Virginia has averaged 11 runs; in his first six starts the Hoos averaged just 2.3 runs.

""It's just a combined team effort"" Abbott said. ""Obviously we've had a great defense our pitching has been solid and our hitting is turning the corner at the right time. It's coming together.""

With yesterday’s win the Cavaliers improved to 23-21 overall and 14-17 in ACC play. It's the first time they've been within three games of .500 in ACC play since sitting at 2-5 in mid-March. UVa has five games left in the regular season including two more this weekend against Wake Forest.

""To respond like we did tonight was great to see"" said O'Connor whose team is trying to bolster its NCAA Tournament resume over these final two weekends. ""Now when we get up tomorrow morning we've got to turn our attention to Game 2 and we've got to come out and play good baseball again.""

SUGAR LAND Texas — Governor Greg Abbott was in Fort Bend County Saturday to join a rally denouncing hate and discrimination against the Asian-American community.

“I think it’s important for every Asian to stop the hate crimes everywhere against Asian people"" attendee Cindy said.

Dozens of people gathered with him in front of Sugar Land City Hall with one message on their mind.

“There are many things that we stand for as a people but we need to stand for them loudly and proudly and visibly because there is no real hate in the American people but sometimes there isn’t enough loudness in our voices"" Melvin Menezes said.

“That is anti-American in my opinion seeing someone or discriminating against them just for their race in any form is terrible"" Eamonn O’Neill said.

Gov. Abbott spoke at the rally saying Americans must stand together against the hate.

“This is so important that we unequivocally make clear that we’re not going to tolerate hate or violence against the Asian community or against any community in the state of Texas"" Gov. Abbott said. “And the attacks that have been on the Asian-American community we’re going to show that they will not be tolerated in the state of Texas.”

Even though there haven’t been as many attacks in Texas as in other states he says you can’t let your guard down.

“You get in advance of it to make sure that we will be taking the strategies and approaches to make sure that we do not have any attacks on Asian-Americans in Texas"" Gov. Abbott said.

And it’s a fight we must continue.

“We need to be vigilant. We need to stand up and be counted. We need to be recognized and that’s why I am here"" Menezes said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vdGVsZXZpc2lvbi8yNTY3NDkyL3doeS1sYXN0LW1hbi1zdGFuZGluZy1maW5hbC1zZWFzb24tYXZvaWRlZC10b3BpY2FsLXN0b3J5bGluZXMtZXZlbnQtZXBpc29kZXMtdGltLWFsbGVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Last Man Standing's Final Season Has Avoided Topical Storylines And Event Episodes,"Unlike many TV shows out there Tim Allen's Last Man Standing had the quasi-privilege of learning ahead of Season 9 that this would be its final season on Fox giving the creative team the chance to close out the story as it so desired. That set the stage for the premiere episode's post-pandemic time jump and for all the episodes that followed which by and large steered clear of anything political and topical and also avoided big Event Episodes that shined a spotlight on this being the final season. Turns out showrunner Kevin Abbott wasn't into doing any of that.

CinemaBlend had the pleasure of speaking with showrunner Kevin Abbott ahead of Last Man Standing's double-episode series finale and I was curious about the motivation behind keeping Season 9's episodes as grounded and timeless as any in the series. When I asked if bypassing topical narratives was purposefully done to keep these (and past seasons') episodes as rewatchable as possible here's how Abbott answered:

Yes absolutely. I agree with that 1000%. You know I've always been more of the mind where I think Murphy Brown was the example long ago of a show that wasn't necessarily going to syndicate particularly well - although that may not be an issue for shows from now on - because it was so topical-heavy so ripped from today's headlines and jokes were all about that. I do want to kind of keep an eye on the future in terms of I don't want a show that says oh that joke only works if you knew what was happening in this particular political moment which by the time you see this again you'll be going 'What was that?' You know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to do jokes that that are only good the one time you tell them.

Which isn't to say that Last Man Standing has avoided any and all time-sensitive topics in its nine years across both ABC and Fox since the show did lean more into political humor in the years before it shifted networks. But still a lot of that fell into more general party vs. party gags as opposed to jokes about specific incidents involving members of Congress that have sense been voted out. Similarly the sitcom hasn't ever really focused on modern pop culture for its jokes unless one counts Ryan and Kyle's comic book fandom in that respect and I don't.

By the same token while Last Man Standing's early promos for Season 9 tipped a fourth-wall-breaking hat toward this being the final season the episodes themselves haven't gone overboard on gimmicks and bizarre event episodes the way other sitcoms have done in the past. No episodes filled with unexplainable guest stars or wacky trips to Disneyland or animated scenes or anything of that nature. According to Kevin Abbott the idea was to for the writers to just keep crafting the kinds of stories that fans have tuned into for the past nine seasons saying:

And then in terms of not event-ising it a lot of that was just our view on it was: we're just going to keep telling stories the way we've told stories. We'll keep moving the characters along a little bit because that's what we did in the past but that other than the final episode we weren't going to have an eye on the fact that this is the last [season]. 'Only 20 episodes more! Gee only 19 episodes more!' Yeah we weren't gonna do that.

Given that fans should take comfort in the assumption that Last Man Standing's series finale won't end on Tim Allen waking up and realizing the entire show was just a long dream being had by his Home Improvement character Tim Taylor (whose cameo in an early Season 9 episode arguably earned the ""Event Episode"" label more than any others). But I'd be lying if I'd say it wouldn't amuse the hell out of me if they did that. Even more so if it was just a Tim Taylor puppet that Jeff Dunham designed.

Last Man Standing's series finale complete with a Kaitlyn Dever appearance is set to air on Fox on Thursday May 20 at 9:00 p.m. ET with lots of other great shows set to follow it as part of the 2021 Summer TV season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3N0eWxlL2NydXNhZGVycy1lZGdlLWJydW1iaWVzLTMxLTI5LTEwMTcyOTUyNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NZ teams sweep Australia's in Super Rugby opening round,"MELBOURNE Australia (AP) — New Zealand's five Super Rugby sides swept their Australian rivals in the opening trans-Tasman round after the Western Force allowed the Chiefs to escape with a 20-19 win on Saturday.

Domingo Miotti couldn't convert his own try in the 82nd minute leaving the Force to fall short of a comeback win from 20-10 down with 15 minutes left of regular time in Perth.

The Hamilton-based Chiefs deserved a narrow halftime lead despite playing with 13 men but their indiscipline Damian McKenzie's wayward goalkicking and No. 8 Luck Jacobson’s red card inspired the Force.

Miotti's last-gasp conversion miss repeated the ACT Brumbies' fate against the New Zealand champion Crusaders in Christchurch.

Brumbies flyhalf Noah Lolesio missed the sideline conversion of back-rower Rob Valetini’s last-minute try to let the Crusaders win 31-29.

Valetini stretched over the Crusaders' try-line in the last minute. But Lolesio who had kept a perfect kicking record until that point drifted his conversion attempt from the left touchline wide of the left-hand post and the 14-man Crusaders who led throughout the match hung on for the win.

The Crusaders led 19-7 at halftime but a flurry of late penalties reduced them to 14 men and gave the visitors the chance to level the score.

“I'm definitely proud of the effort especially the fight we showed in the second half to put us back in the game” Brumbies captain Allan Alaalatoa said. ""The boys were obviously devastated with the loss.”

No. 8 Hoskins Sotutu scored two early second-half tries to help the Auckland-based Blues outclass the Melbourne Rebels 50-3.

The Blues finished with six tries including two by replacement back Akira Ioane.

Anacle Lau’s startup was formed to provide technological tools that shape the infrastructure of smart cities. At first it was challenging to acquire clients for the basic reason that few knew what a “smart city” encompasses. And without a customer base it was difficult to gain recognition when multinational tech companies that had decades of operational experience were shaping the industry.

“If you build a startup in the US it’d be a lot easier for you to get recognized because generally the American or western market is more open to using technology from startups while companies in Asia are more conservative” Lau said to KrASIA.

Anacle designs and develops end-to-end solutions for smart cities. That means the company’s core mission is to make cities more comfortable to inhabit more efficient for anyone who lives and works within the community. Even with that appeal it took a while for the company to land high-profile clients. But then their reputation began to spread by word of mouth from one satisfied customer to the next entity that was seeking upgrades to its own infrastructure. Now Anacle is the company behind most of Singapore’s smart city projects according to Lau.

“In 2018 Singapore won the Smart City of 2018 award at the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona and Anacle was one of the government’s partners that were present to receive the award” the CEO said.

A smart city uses advanced interconnected technology to solve urban problems and enhance the quality of life for its residents. This entails the utilization of intelligent solutions for energy generation and distribution housing mobility and a litany of public services. Collaboration between governments private companies and organizations as well as local communities is crucial for implementing smart city initiatives successfully and Singapore is one of the trailblazers in this arena. The city-state ranked first in the International Institute for Management Development’s 2020 Smart City Index which weighs factors like economic and technological data as well as citizens’ perceptions.

That’s all to say: when it comes to building a smart city Singapore is more advanced than cities like Helsinki and Zurich which apply technologies to a range of activities related to governance mobility and public health including responses to the pandemic.

Local power wins out

With its advanced infrastructure robust economy and business-friendly policies Singapore is a hotbed for local tech startups that are able to compete on the international stage. As its tech startup ecosystem matures private enterprises as well as government bodies are increasingly confident in local companies like Anacle to take on major projects that involved novel deep tech.

“Previously major global companies like IBM Accenture and SAP were dominating the market” Lau said. “But today we see that Asian tech providers can be as good if not better than some of these big international players.”

Bit by bit Anacle is embedding new tech into existing structures and infrastructure undoing mass-scale inefficiencies that were knotted into urban systems years or even decades ago. “In Singapore we do a lot of real estate management software. More than 20000 buildings have been automated by our software which is a big number as Singapore is not a big city. We also work with around 700 buildings for energy and water management solutions. These are two of our biggest business areas that are revolutionizing Singapore’s smart city” Lau said. In recent years Anacle has been recognized as the go-to provider for smart city technologies. Anacle’s exponential capabilities are turning the city smart ushering in a better future.

Most of Anacle’s customers fall into three categories: the government commercial real estate and utilities and telecommunications. The company works with various ministries and government agencies as a tech partner that implements AI and IoT solutions for their projects. These include the Ministry of Defence the Ministry of Health and the Housing and Development Board for its Smart Estate Management Systems (SEMS). Anacle also counts Changi Airport Jurong Port CapitaLand and Singtel as clients.

“Basically our customers are any company that has heavy infrastructure assets and lots of buildings” said Lau.

Anacle combines hardware and software to integrate solutions for energy management through its Starlight® system. For enterprise resource planning the company has its Simplicity® system a suite of business software applications that manages an enterprise’s assets financials supply chains shared resources and commercial tenants where applicable. The company uses the latest IoT technologies and encrypts its signals and data using strong cybersecurity measures and artificial intelligence. It is a pioneer in some areas of smart city technologies such as 3D digital twins (virtual representations of a physical object such as facilities or assets in a building) as well as fog computing and infrastructure (decentralized computing between the cloud and devices that collect data from the physical world).

Take for instance Starlight’s flagship product: the Tesseract® smart meter which Lau said is the world’s “smartest power meter.” Launched in 2017 it is the only IoT-ready smart system of its kind that supports both Android and Linux making it future-proofed for edge computing and new possibilities for energy management.

“In the smart meter space there are about 6000 competitors globally. What we realized several years back is most of the existing smart digital meters have the computing power of high school calculators. This is unacceptable in the era of smartphones. So we thought what if we create smart meters with computing power at the same level as the latest smartphones such as the iPhone X? We could do a lot of magic that previously could not be done” said Lau.

Tesseract® goes beyond measuring and analyzing utility consumption. Its functionality includes demand response control and load management allowing users to manage and fine-tune their energy consumption without hassle.

“For example if you install Tesseract® outside of your house I can actually tell what appliances you are using inside your house and I can estimate the energy consumption of each of them. Tesseract® can also control smart sockets so you can turn off non-critical equipment remotely to manage your utility bills. If it is installed in an industrial building or commercial environment it can predict equipment failure” Lau said.

The industry players behind most smart meters are still conservative which is why Anacle’s Tesseract® is ahead of the game globally. “Since our software business has been profitable it generates substantial cash for investment in R&D which allows us to make innovations like this” he said.

In its first ten years of operation Anacle found backing from VC funds and raised a sum of USD 6.5 million from various investors like iGlobe Partners and Majuven according to Crunchbase. The company went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December 2016.

Anacle already has a footprint beyond its headquarters in Singapore. The firm has 11 smart city projects in China in collaboration with a real estate developer in Hangzhou and works with a number of public hospitals in the United Arab Emirates. It has formed a partnership with Vingroup the largest real estate developer in Vietnam. Anacle’s branch offices dot the region—Hangzhou China; Kuala Lumpur Malaysia; and Pune India.

To date the company manages tracks and maintains 10 million infrastructure assets and its solutions have optimized the management of 60 million sq ft of corporate real estate. So far the firm serves around 4.8 million public housing residents as well as 2000 smart houses and offices scattered around the world.

Going forward Lau said Anacle will focus on expanding its business and operations in Asia for the next five years as the region is a major growth market. Many Asian tech players like Anacle have matured and are each a significant global force.

“For our long-term goal we aim to become a significant global player that is not only changing Singapore’s environment tech but also to be a global agent of good and digitalization for many other cities in the world especially in sustainable innovation and sustainable development” Lau said.

An Oxford Economics and NTT DATA survey of 1000 business leaders conducted in early 2020 reveals that 96% of companies were at least researching AI solutions and over 70% had either fully implemented or at least piloted the technology.

Nearly half of survey respondents said failure to implement AI would cause them to lose customers with 44% reporting their company’s bottom line would suffer without it.

Simply put AI enables companies to parse vast quantities of business data to make well-informed and critical business decisions fast. And the transportation management industry specifically is using this intelligence and its companion technology machine learning (ML) to gain greater process efficiency and performance visibility driving impactful changes bolstering the bottom line.

Tools reduce costs increase revenue

McKinsey research reveals that 61% of executives report decreased costs and 53% report increased revenues as a direct result of introducing AI into their supply chains. For supply chains lower inventory-carrying costs inventory reductions and lower transportation and labor costs are some of the biggest areas for savings captured by high volume shippers. Further AI boost supply chain management revenue in sales forecasting spend analytics and logistics network optimization.

For the trucking industry and other freight carriers AI is being effectively applied to transportation management practices to help reduce the amount of unprofitable empty miles or “deadhead” trips a carrier makes returning to domicile with an empty trailer after delivering a load. AI also identifies other hidden patterns in historical transportation data to determine the optimal mode selection for freight most efficient labor resource planning truck loading and stop sequences rate rationalization and other process improvement by applying historical usage data to derive better planning and execution outcomes.

The ML portion of this emerging technology helps organizations optimize routing and even plan for weather-driven disruptions. Through pattern recognition for instance ML helps transportation management professionals understand how weather patterns affected the time it took to carry loads in the past then considers current data sets to make predictive recommendations.

Pandemic accelerates adoption of AI and ML

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) put a tremendous amount of pressure on many industries – the transportation industry included – but it also presented a silver lining -- the opportunity for change. Since organizations are increasingly pressed to work smarter to fulfill customers’ expectations and needs there is increased appetite to retire inefficient legacy tools and invest in new processes and tech tools to work more efficiently.

Applying AI and ML to pandemic-posed challenges can be the critical difference between accelerating or slowing growth for transportation management professionals. When applied correctly these technologies improve logistics visibility offer data-driven planning insights and help successfully increase process automation.

Like many emerging technologies promising transformation AI and ML have in many cases been misrepresented or worse overhyped as panaceas for vexing industry challenges. Transportation logistics organizations should be prudent and perform due diligence when considering when and how to introduce AI and ML to their operations. Panicked hiring of data scientists to implement expensive complicated tools and overengineered processes can be a costly boondoggle and can sour the perception of the viability of these truly powerful and useful tech tools. Instead organizations should invest time in learning more about the technology and how it is already driving value for successful adopters in the transportation logistics industry. What are some steps a logistics operation should take as they embark on an AI/ML initiative?

Data quality should come first

Remember that the quality of your data will drive how fast or slow your AI journey will go. The lifeblood of an effective AI program (or any big data project) is proper data hygiene and management. Unfortunately compiling organizing and accessing this data is a major barrier for many. According to a survey conducted by O’Reilly 70% of respondents report that poorly labeled data and unlabeled data are a significant challenge. Other common data quality issues respondents cited include poor data quality from third-party sources (~42%) disorganized data stores and lack of metadata (~50%) and unstructured difficult-to-organize data (~44%).

Historically slow-to-adopt technology the transportation industry has recently begun realizing the imperative and making up ground with 60% of an MHI and Deloitte poll respondents expecting to embrace AI in the next five years. Gartner predicts that by the end of 2024 75% of organizations will move from piloting to operationalizing AI driving a five times increase in streaming data and analytics infrastructures.

For many transportation management companies accessing cleansing and integrating the right data to maximize AI will be the first step. AI requires large volumes of detailed data and varied data sources to effectively identify models and develop learned behavior.

Review capabilities and consider getting help

Before jumping on the AI bandwagon too quickly companies should assess the quality of their data and current tech stacks to determine what intelligence capabilities are already embedded.

And when it comes to investing in newer technologies to pave the path toward digital transformation choose AI-driven solutions that do not require you to become a data scientist.

308 ENNISBROOK DRIVE

In September 2017 Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi bought 308 Ennisbrook for $7.196 million; the following spring they sold it for $11 million to Tinder founder Sean Rad. For both transactions DeGeneres hid behind Harley Neuman (her business manager) and the Adobe Trust. Now in an off-market sale not recorded in MLS Neuman is once again listed as the buyer this time for $14.314 million. Certainly one of his other clients could have bought it or he could have bought it for himself. Given DeGeneres’s love of real estate and her wife’s love of horses however it seems more likely that they wanted an equestrian property to go with their new $49 million Picacho Lane compound. This wouldn’t be the first time DeGeneres has bought back a property she sold. Perhaps Architectural Digest should update its timeline of her real-estate transactions (which doesn’t even include a recent flip that no one ever reported). P.S.

The Green Bay Packers saw enough from Kurt Benkert during rookie minicamp to sign the quarterback to the team’s roster.

Benkert 25 tweeted a photo of himself signing a contract with the Packers. He joined Chad Kelly as the two tryout quarterbacks at rookie minicamp in Green Bay on Friday and Saturday.

An undrafted free agent out of Virginia in 2018 Benkert spent his first three NFL seasons with the Atlanta Falcons mostly on the team’s practice squad.

The Packers now have four quarterbacks on the roster although Aaron Rodgers’ status with the team remains up in the air. The team signed veteran Blake Bortles earlier this week providing some experience to team with 2020 first-round pick Jordan Love.

The next stage of the offseason workout program kicks off later this month.

Benkert has never played in a regular-season game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9taW5uZXNvdGEtZmFtaWx5LW93bmVkLWNvbXBhbnktYnVpbGQtMTMxMjAwMjI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota family-owned company will build one-third of U.S. wind projects this year,"Just off the main drag in Avon a sleepy town in the middle of Stearns County is a fourth-generation company steeped in experience building the infrastructure that powers America.

The company helped build the Great Northern Railroad a century ago the state and interstate highway systems post-World War II and now some of the largest and most complex energy projects on the continent.

David Henry Blattner formed the firm as a railway contractor company in 1907.

Now great-grandson Scott Blattner the company's president has shepherded it through the most recent transition — shifting focus from D.H. Blattner & Sons to a new sister company Blattner Energy which has become a national leader as a renewable-energy contractor specializing in building wind farms solar farms and energy storage infrastructure.

""We have finite resources — we're either going to build a railroad or we're going to build a wind farm"" Blattner said. ""You can be a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none — and we just didn't want to do that.""

The company now has more than 450 wind and solar projects to its name and is celebrating the milestone of producing 50000 megawatts of renewable energy. This year the company expects to build one-third of all U.S. wind projects.

""We're in the sweet spot for sure for the business to power forward"" Blattner said. ""I see it as an energy revolution. You can't look at it any other way.""

'The right risk to take'The company which continues to be majority-owned by Blattner family members experienced a crisis two decades ago as the price of gold and copper fell and profits from mining and commodities dried up.

""We really got put on our knees in the late '90s and were considering whether we keep going with the business or not"" Scott Blattner said. ""There was a lot of humility it took to go through that.""

Blattner 61 said his executive team did a lot of soul-searching and kept coming back to wind energy. The company made the full transition to wind energy in the early 2000s.

""We believed one day [wind] would get to where it is today but I don't know if we appreciated or understood the power of it back then"" Blattner said.

Eliminating railroad work and focusing solely on utility-scale wind farms was a way to give the company a competitive advantage.

""That puts us more at risk for those markets but we felt it was the right risk to take"" Blattner said.

Only five major companies do this in the United States said Peder Mewis western regional policy manager at Clean Grid Alliance an organization supporting renewable-energy developers and helping shape state energy policy.

In addition to Blattner Minnesota's Mortenson Energy is among that select group.

""They're two of the biggest players in the industry"" Mewis said. ""They've done a really good job of carving out their space in this sphere.""

In 2005 coal made up about 76% of the energy in the midcontinent energy grid that delivers power across 15 states and into Canada. By 2018 coal had dropped to 47% in the grid's portfolio with wind and solar making up 8%.

By 2030 the organization predicts renewables will eclipse coal — with wind and solar making up 31% and coal just 27% of energy delivered across the grid.

And with renewable energy becoming as cost-effective or even more so than coal — even without subsidies — the only thing holding back wind and solar growth are constraints on the transmission system Mewis said.

""We're hitting a brick wall where there just isn't enough room on the system to build more renewable-energy projects"" he said.

Despite the current constraints demand for renewable energy from citizens and companies is increasing.

""You look at corporate buyers — they are a significant piece of the marketplace because their employees and their customers want to see it"" Blattner said.

Utility-scale solar gaining steamBlattner predicts the next two decades will be ripe for more growth especially as the company makes another transition: shifting the majority of its work from wind to solar projects in response to market demand.

Blattner employs about 350 people at its Avon headquarters and depending on the season anywhere from 3000 to 5000 employees on any given day at project sites across the country according to Christine Huston communications director at Blattner.

Huston said the privately owned company prefers not to share its annual revenue but shared recent profiles of the business that show revenue growth during the company's transition to wind: from about $125 million in 2001 to $622 million in 2008 and $1.35 billion in 2015. Every project Blattner builds Huston added is within the $100 million range.

To celebrate the milestone of 50000 megawatts of renewable energy the company installed a solar-powered art installation on the Lake Wobegon Trail in Avon and contributed to funding for new festoon lights in downtown St. Cloud.

""It means a lot more than the number"" Huston said of the milestone. ""It certainly means the number of projects we've worked on but that also means the number of communities we've worked in and given back to whether it is through the creation of jobs for the construction [or] just providing more economic benefits especially for the rural communities because that's where a lot of our projects are built.""

Blattner started working at project sites at the age of 12 and they feel like home to him.

""That's where my heart is — it's with working with the people in the field. It's the camaraderie"" he said. ""I think there's something about building something and standing back and saying 'We accomplished that.' That's always very satisfying to me.""

The company now employs some in the fifth generation of Blattners.

""It's kind of a bittersweet time for us because we just never imagined that we'd put a business model together that would have this kind of energy and power"" he said. ""It's a great testament to the people of our organization.""",,,,,,

A young woman recently revealed on social media that the Airbnb she was staying in had an unexpected surprise. According to a video she shared online her Airbnb had an abandoned mall sitting underneath it.

Claire Scheulin posted videos of the mall to her TikTok account where she said she and her friend were fine but that the abandoned mall was a ""a little creepy."" In the footage she shows off an empty promenade area for a mall that’s seemingly been closed down.

TRAVELERS BOOKING OUTDOOR ESCAPES PRESSURE AIRBNB TO SEEK MORE HOSTS

In a later video she clarified that her Airbnb was part of a building above the mall but that she wouldn’t be giving out the exact link until after she and her friend had left. Yet another video showed off that there was still one café that appeared to be in the middle of the mall that still had some people visiting it.

Since the original video was uploaded it has been viewed over 7 million times.

While Scheulin wouldn’t give the exact location while she’s still staying there Yahoo News reports that some users were able to figure out that the mall was likely in Florida. It’s believed that the mall is located in a building that has a series of apartments and room above it that are still active.

Many users commented about the similarity between the footage that Scheulin posted and an urban legend/scary story known as ""The Backrooms."" Basically the story typically involves an office worker being transported to an empty inescapable maze of offices that exists slightly outside of reality.

Earlier this week Claire known as @claire.scheulin on TikTok shared a video of inside the shopping centre.

""POV: Your Airbnb has an abandoned mall in the basement"" she wrote in the caption showing clips of the shopping centre's staircase elevator and a long empty hallway.

The video blew up on TikTok with more than 1.3 million likes and several people who were spooked by it.

In a later TikTok Claire explained she did not know the video was going to go viral like it did and reassured people she and her friends were okay.

""It's kind of creepy but it's fine"" she says in the video.

In the third video posted by Claire she took people on a tour of the Airbnb including an eerie shot of a room filled with dated furniture.

Claire then included another TikTok video of a man named Josh who had also stayed in the building a few years back.

Josh explained the building had one working elevator.

""But basically the place was so run down and sketchy — it's a weird simulation glitch really"" Josh says in his video.

He added there was a cafe people would go and have coffee at despite it being situated in an abandoned shopping centre.

Claire then shared a video of people sitting at the cafe.

Despite people wanting to know where the abandoned mall is Claire did not say where it was.

However people in the comments said it was likely located in Florida's Hollywood.

Both Claire and Josh may have stayed above the abandoned Oceanwalk Mall which a Google Search confirms is closed In The Know reported.

Though the mall is closed the apartments and rooms which sit above are still open.

In the comments of Claire's tour of the abandoned mall one person said they had been there too and said it was in Hollywood.

They said it wasn't scary but rather ""pretty cool"".

Someone else said the Oceanwalk Mall had three stores in the mall another person commented saying it was ""not really abandoned"".

Thirty years before President Ronald Reagan visited the Harley-Davidson Motorcycle plant in Springettsbury Township he visited the General Electric plant in York; then as director-producer-and host of the “General Electric Theater” television program and President of the Screen Actors Guild.

Reagan’s visit to Harley-Davidson on May 6 1987 was heavily chronicled via photos and videos. There is a YouTube video of his remarks to the employees; courtesy of Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Ronald Reagan’s visit to the General Electric plant at 463 South Albemarle Street in the east end of York on March 13 1957 was photographed by J. David Allen.

The introductory photo is part of the J. David Allen collection; which is presently being cataloged at the York County History Center. It shows Ronald Reagan at the General Electric plant in York surrounded by company employees; likely in a shop area. Unfortunately none of the employees are identified. Do any readers recognize any of the individuals?

Another of the Allen photos appeared in The Gazette and Daily of March 14 1957. Those individuals were identified; and by use of a 1957 Directory of York the positions of three of them at the GE plant were discovered: Mrs. Sandra Pike (clerk) Mrs. Anne Peters (stenographer) and Mrs. Clara Ream (typist). Therefore that photo was likely taken in an office area.

Ronald Reagan became a spokesman for General Electric in 1954 when he was hired to host the national TV program “General Electric Theater;” a half-hour CBS dramatic show airing every Sunday evening at 9:00 o’clock.

For the show from 1954 until 1962 in addition to the celebrity guests Ronald Reagan and his “progress reporter” Don Herbert gathered news on General Electric’s contributions to progress through research engineering and manufacturing skill. During the eight-years the program was broadcast for 208 show episodes Reagan and Herbert visited more than 130 General Electric labs and factories.

The following is a wider view of introductory photo. Do any readers recognize any of the individuals that worked at the General Electric plant in York during 1957?

Reagan’s visits to local General Electric plants also often involved speaking to a civic organization in the area. Such was the case in York. Reagan’s day in York included: speaker for the noon luncheon of the Rotary Club of York in the Hotel Yorktowne; visiting the General Electric plant; and in the evening speaker at the first annual meeting of the United Fund of York County in the Y.M.C.A. Auditorium.

General Electric’s plant in York was located at 463 South Albermarle Street; just south of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad tracks in the eastern end of York City. At the time of Reagan’s visit the site was GE’s national headquarters for the manufacture of welding equipment.

General Electric’s wire and cable production moved from that site in 1953 to Bridgeport Connecticut. General Electric transformed the site by construction of two new buildings; joining the former structures to provide for continuous straight-line production lines. And repurposed a former high-bay factory building into a modern two-story office building. The open house for the new welding equipment manufacturing plant was held October 21 1954. The plant produced all types of electric arc welding equipment.

The history of a General Electric production facility in York goes back to 1921 when General Electric’s York Wire and Cable Works was organized; via the purchase of a local company that was producing insulated wire and cable products which were fireproof. The plant originated as locally owned Heany Fireproof Wire Company in 1906.

During World War II the men and women of the York Works of General Electric were granted an Army-Navy “E” Award for production excellence. The local GE plant was the sixth of 19 York County factories granted the “E” Award. Quoting from the following notice about the presentation on July 29 1943: “The Army-Navy Production Award is bestowed upon the GE workers of York Works for skill and precision in producing limitless miles of specialized wire and cable; the very life-lines of power for ships planes tanks guns and countless other implements of war for our fighting forces.”

Also during World War II General Electric had a second plant in York which manufactured rocket igniters. That 170 East Boundary Avenue plant produced igniters that initiated the firing of rocket-propelled four-pound armor-piercing grenades; in a weapon dubbed the bazooka. The story of that plant which closed in 1949 is told in the YorksPast post at this link.

The proposal which would create 291 apartment units several floors dedicated to 12500 square feet of commercial space and offices and a three-story parking garage would break ground in September in preparation of a 2023 opening.

“It’s a balance” said Bob Klebba of the Madison Trust for Historic Preservation. “Historic preservation and new development are almost always at odds particularly in situations like what we’ve had on State Street or on Langdon Street or here on this parcel where the Wonder Bar is located.”

Preservationists like Klebba or Madison Trust for Historic Preservation President Kurt Stege say the story behind the Wonder Bar is what makes it worth saving.

“This place was built in 1930 It was built by a guy who had a number of brothers who were in the mob – were gangsters in the Chicago area” Stege said. “It was during the (Al) Capone era. They were viewed as competitorsYou can walk by it you can drive by it and if you know the story if you know the connection it comes out and you remember it. It takes you back connects you to a different era.”

In recent days however Klebba and Stege have learned there’s a possibility of saving the building but it won’t be easy.

“The building can be lifted and moved” Klebba said. “But that’s not the issue. The larger issue in this site is finding a landing site for it.”

Klebba says ideally they’re looking to keep the building within a mile of it’s current location.

“It’s not about the willingness of the developer and the neighborhood to preserve it it’s really about open space” Klebba said. “And there’s less and less open space in Madison these days.”

To move the building further away would require more resources and drive costs significantly. Klebba says while they’re no set deadline to find a new home it’d likely have to be solidified sometime over the next few months.

Both men say they’re hopeful for a solution which can preserve the unique history of the building itself.”

“All around the city there are things that remind me of important things” Stege said. “Here this connects you to prohibition.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5vdGVzLW1heS0xNi0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Notes: May 16 2021,"The Gazette’s Business Notes is a compendium of the week's promotions new hires certifications added business lines and business events among other items in Cedar Rapids Iowa City and the rest of the Corridor.

He bought it.

Wiggins as president of Wiggin Properties LLC and manager of its affiliated 14000 QSP LP paid $21564158 for Quail Springs Parkway Plaza an anchor of the office sector in northwest Oklahoma City.

The nearly 300000-square-foot complex of two connected six-story office buildings is on 15.5 acres at 14000 Quail Springs Parkway. Quail Springs Office Park is north of Memorial Road/Kilpatrick Turnpike between May and Portland avenues.

The seller was Quail Springs Office LLC which had owned the property for 22 years. It sold for about $1 million less than it did in 1999; then it fetched $22.5 million county records show.

Craig Tucker office specialist and managing broker of Price Edwards Co. represented the seller. The buildings constructed in 1986 and 1988 were nearly 90% leased at the time of sale with the recent signing of an 84000-square-foot lease negotiated by Tucker and Tom Fields of Price Edwards.

Wiggin considered the purchase something of a bargain.

“Office space is not currently a preferred asset class in part due to the expectation of soft demand and challenges renewing leases in the environment of a pandemic. Chuck Wiggin

“Office space is not currently a preferred asset class in part due to the expectation of soft demand and challenges renewing leases in the environment of a pandemic. This has resulted in fewer competing offers that drive up a property’s price” he said. “We take a long-term view and are confident that our strong office management organization our staff’s experience and our proprietary tools will deliver healthy returns to our investors.”

The property with 298610 rentable square feet includes an underground parking garage a two-story lobby and a sky bridge connecting the towers.

“Quail Springs Parkway Plaza presented us an exceptional opportunity to acquire a uniquely high quality asset with the expectation of above-market cash flow returns"" Wiggin said.

Quail Springs Parkway Plaza was the first major office project in Quail Springs Office Park also called Quail Springs Corporate Park a 125-acre master planned commercial development. The corporate neighborhood includes offices for Costco the FBI AT&T AAA EOG Resources Gulfport Exploration and other high profile office users.

Major tenants include Haskell Allstate Insurance Cheyenne Petroleum and Liberty Mutual Insurance.

It was the second addition to Wiggin Properties’ investment portfolio in the past six months. Wiggin bought M.D. Medical Building in Midwest City in November.

That thought was on the mind of several Drive readers who e-mailed in after reading a recent Star Tribune article about whether the electrical grid has the capacity to power the proliferating number of electric vehicles hitting the roads. They wondered if owners of electric vehicles qualify for roadside assistance should their batteries go dead.

The answer is yes said Jesse Simon senior manager of marketing and communications for AAA Minneapolis. But the services the auto club offers depend on the type of vehicle a member owns.

AAA provides jump-starts fuel delivery and battery replacement for members with gas-powered vehicles and most hybrid vehicles. The club does not provide jump-starts or battery replacements for drivers whose vehicles are 100% powered by electricity. Not to worry Simon said — AAA won't leave a motorist stranded on the side of the road.

""If a member with an EV calls for battery-related service we most likely would tow their vehicle to a service station dealership or charging station"" he said. ""We can still provide many services for members who drive electric vehicles. This includes mechanical first aid flat tire service lockout service extrication and towing.""

AAA and many of its tow providers don't have mobile battery charging service ""as we haven't identified this as a significant need by our members"" Simon said. As demand for EVs grows — nearly 60% of all passenger vehicles sold by 2040 will be electric according to an analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance an arm of the Bloomberg news and research firm — Simon said AAA anticipates that ""we'll need to expand our service offerings for EVs at some point in the future.""

Allstate Roadside can provide on-site jump starts if an electric vehicle is a hybrid — meaning it is equipped with a 12 volt battery said spokeswoman Tanya Robinson. A fully electric vehicle must be towed to a charging station or the vehicle owner's home she said.

But that could change. Though not yet offered in Minneapolis Allstate is able to bring a portable roadside charging station and offer a fast charge to stranded EV motorists in cities such as Austin Texas Boston Chicago Dallas Los Angeles New York City and San Francisco.

""More are coming online in the very near future"" she said.

State Farm's Emergency Roadside Assistance offers an array of services and pays the cost incurred by insured drivers who experience a breakdown and the service ""applies equally to any vehicle covered under this policy"" including electric vehicles said spokesman Ben Palmer.

The following Is a transcript of Big Technology Podcast edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts Spotify or your app of choice. Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Neeva an ads-free search engine he helped found after running Google's ads and commerce business. Ramaswamy spent seventeen years inside Google  and eventually grew disillusioned with its ad business. Now he's trying to build the solution with $77.5 million in funding. In this conversation we discuss his evolving view on advertising what decoupling search from ads allows from a product standpoint and how the current antitrust environment is opening Google up to competition. Alex Kantrowitz: Google where you used to work — they call it Alphabet now — made $31.9 billion in search ad sales last quarter alone up from $24.5 billion in Q1 2020. YouTube ad sales were up 49% to $6 billion in Q1. This growth is going to hit a ceiling one would imagine? Sridhar Ramaswamy: That will happen when digital advertising is most all of advertising and we have not quite hit the ceiling yet. We've hit ceilings in a number of areas like smartphone sales — year on year it's not really growing significantly — but he move to online advertising is part of the way there. Yet you're building a search engine with no ads? In the history of business there has never been a company that's commanded 90+ percent market share in a market that's $100+ billion. If you look art previous cases of what has disrupted them? It is typically a subscription play. What did HBO do to Time Warner? What did Netflix do to ad-supported television? What did Amazon Prime do to traditional e-commerce? The common theme is the subscription model. Back to my earlier point about how smartphone sales have tapered off Apple has actually not grown revenue significantly but its subscription business and stock are growing because it has invested more and more into services and subscriptions. So Neeva is an entirely subscription-based search engine trying to follow this pattern? The ads model has always gotten disrupted. I know from both personal experience and the enormous amount of user studies that we have done that there is resentment about it. So we wanted to create Neeva as a product that catered only to customers and was very very strict about things like not having ads in it. To us subscription search was the way to create a superior product. And having really squeaky clean business principles — not just no ads but no affiliate links ever no data getting packaged and sold ever being privacy-first — all of those are consequences of the model where we say ""We want to create the best product for you."" So is your product going to be a nice luxury product — privacy for the rich — or do you think it can be something that will appeal to the masses? And if so why? Our aspiration is to be a product that everybody will want. Search is something that people do a dozen times a day there are not many things that people go back to time and time and time again. We think of ourselves as creating a daily-use product without any worries without any gadgets so we think will be able to price this at a point where lots of people really really get value from it and will pay for it. Scott Galloway who wrote ""The Four"" compares Google to God. It used to be you would ask God ""When will my sick kid be healed?"" Now you type the symptoms into Google. I suppose it doesn't occur to us that when we're speaking to our god stand-in we're speaking to an advertiser at the same time. You know something? The ad-supported model even for queries like that sick child tends to favor high engagement sites that have figured out how to get your attention and how to cram a lot of ads. In fact I joke to people that anytime I do a medical search and go to a medical health site generally my conclusion is like ""I have a serious problem and I'm dying.""

watch now

I went to WebMD a little while ago and it was for scratchy throat and WebMD was like ""Well you may just have the common cold or you might have Ebola."" It's the same as clickbait. It's the system that is working as it is designed On those queries the features we at Neeva think about are ""How do we surface government website? How do we surface high authority websites and not the ones that are chasing after clicks?"" Part of the benefit of the subscription model is that it can focus a lot more on what is authoritative what is higher quality information for you. Okay but isn't the purpose of Google to get you useful results so that you just keep coming back? The answer depends on what queries you're thinking about. When it comes to commercial queries the algorithm is now optimized towards showing your results in which you click on ads and those are the ones that are taking up more and more of the space. One of the ways in which you get that growth is by taking that extra line and search ads over the years have gone from taking 3% of the result on the page to 10% 20%. I joke to people if you search on a place like yahoo.com even on a large screen you only see ads. And so there is now this very strong incentive to show you results that are ads. And ads are a conflict of interest for the search engine. Should they show you an ad or should they show you the best result? It'll surprise you to know that one of the biggest feature asks that we have are things like ""I want to control what retailers I see. I do not want to see big retailers when I search. I want smaller retailers. If I'm looking for clothing I only want to be shown stores that make a commitment to ethically sourcing their material."" Not showing the top retailer in the country is not an option for an ad-driven search engine. For us it's a feature we must build because that's what keeps you as a customer. Right because that top retailer is also going to be a top advertiser for Google. That's right. You also allow people to also tailor the news results they want to see. On NFL draft weekend I was searching for the Jets picks and Neeva let me decided whether I want to see more ESPN or more of the fan blogs when I search. That struck me as a cool feature — now I have some more control in terms of what I'm seeing when I search — is that intentional? That's 100% intentional. Giving you agency over the search results is one of the things that we focus on a lot. The other features we have built around personalization being able to bring your personal data into a safe environment where you can search. Lots of us have multiple email accounts multiple [Google] Drive-like accounts I was talking to someone I think that had nine email accounts that they connected to their Neeva account because they were like ""Yeah how am I going to search through all of them?"" So things like personalization giving you agency is very much a core part of the product. And in some ways we are impatient about the tech that we have to build because we want to be able to support things like this more and more. With news we worry about things like filter bubbles. We have ideas for how we present different perspectives. In a couple of months I want to be able to come back to you and say ""Hey Alex you're a public personality would you be open to having your news preferences be available to any nearby user so they can see the world the way you see it?"" Oh that's interesting. I often have diametrically opposite viewpoints on my screen. I like looking at CNN on one side and Fox News on the other side and going ""This is the same country this is my country. Let's see what's here."" It goes back to this thing of — you have choice and we should make it possible for you to exercise choice in different ways. I was going to ask you the filter bubble question but you preempted me. The most basic layer of this is to pick your news sites. But then one level deeper than that is starting to pick viewpoints — do you want the left or the right view? Or do you want a particular person's view? We relate to people we don't relate to abstract concepts. So you want to see the world that Alex does or David Brooks? To me that's super cool. We are a signed-in product we are a subscription product I'm not ashamed of either of these. I believe capitalism should enable great products at scale so I don't think of ourselves as creating somehow this elitist premium product. You pay for it but that makes the product better that allows us to serve you better. And along the way we want to be able to build the features that make the product your own. Could any of this stuff happen at Google? Because I imagine Google allowing people to customize the publishers that they get or making decisions about what type of publications to show would be a little bit tricky… Google can do anything. It's an enormously powerful enormously successful company. But then people ask me ""Why did you not want to do this within Google?"" The answer is that sometimes principles have to be thought over from the ground up and a successful company is necessarily and correctly hesitant about what it sees as heretical ideas. And so this is the reason why I felt it was really important that I press the reset button in my life. Some things are easy but will Google ever really want to create a completely ads-free product in which you can customize everything? I say they can do everything but at this point in their history with all the antitrust stuff it is also going to look very odd if they were to do that right now. I think this is one of those classic cases where success hinges on a set of parameters that are going to become hard to change especially after you achieve what $120 billion of success. That's a lot of dollars speaking here. When you talk about ""heretical ideas"" would it be a heretical to bring this ads-free idea up inside Google? I've done many of these things before. Even the move that we made to have desktop and mobile advertising be a single concept we call this enhanced campaigns this was like 2013 2014.... Inside Google? Inside Google. And it is just so hard to pull off because you have people that are wedded to one way of doing things. I was in charge of making all of the shopping property into a paid property. So I've gone through these changes but some changes are extra super hard. I want to hear a little bit more about your personal story. We talked a little bit about how ads have started to fill up more and more of the Google page. This happened under... My watch. So did it happen slowly where you started to say ""Maybe this isn't the right way to do search"" or did it happen all at once? I was the exec in charge of many of the increases in ad load there was an expectation of a certain amount of growth there were a set of techniques that were available for how you increased growth you're always very thoughtful about the trade-offs implied by growth. There came a certain point in time that when it came to the overall ad ecosystem I said ""I don't want to be working on that anymore."" I'm an accidental ads person I had nothing to do with ads before I joined Google. I joke to people my first boss found the word ""database"" in my resume and sent me to work on the ad system that was the reason why I've worked on ads for 15 years.

If you look at the math of how Google works a vanishing fraction of people work on Google search...The size of the Google Ads team and the Google Ads product team dwarfs that of the search team. Sridhar Ramaswamy Neeva CEO former Google Ads boss

This idea of Neeva came later. We love the problem with a different model it can be a powerful differentiator. I started the subscription business initially as ""This is the best way to provide alignment between you the customer and as the provider."" But then you learn all of these other qualities that they bring. 100% of your team is focused on creating the product. If you look at the math of how Google works a vanishing fraction of people work on Google search. And you would think like ""How can that be?"" But that's the reality the size of the Google Ads team and the Google Ads product team dwarfs that of the search team. The Google ads team's bigger than the search team? 100%. Wild. And if you take the ads business team and the ads product and engineering teams they're way larger than the search team. Obviously people are going to look at it as competitive to your old employer. Did you worry about relationships there or how it might be received? What has the feedback been from your former colleagues? I obviously do worry about it I have a lot of close relationships with a lot of people at Google. And I would roughly say that feedback falls into two buckets one set of people that go like ""Yeah we understand why you're doing this and why you didn't think you could do this within Google."" And a different set that goes ""We wish really you had done this within Google because if anyone could have changed what Google was it should have been you."" Both are reasonable points of view and there are some people that don't just want to deal with it this is all too much for them and I respect those points of view but at some level one has to be driven by what one sees is the right long-term outcome. I personally do not think of ad-supported free products as being good for consumers good for our country in the long term because it is very hard for them to stay true to what you and I want as users and as customers of these products. That conflict of interest is just really really unavoidable. And the fact of the matter Alex is that while at one level the products are free all the benefits of scale for products like this they go to the creator of the product they don't come to you and me. When it comes to Neeva for example I talk about charging a subscription of like $5 to $10 at most per month. Okay so we got the price… And as we gain scale I expect the product to actually get cheaper over time. When you start with a free product the product does not get any freer for you all the benefits of scale go to the creator of the product. So in many ways I actually see these as not even working with the same principles of capitalism that's worked so well for us as a country and honestly as a globe for the last 100 200 years. And so we think a back to basics of ""You're the customer you pay for the product in the long term it's going to give us better products than free products that basically they all charge the advertiser."" And do you know who then turns and gives you and me a higher price? The advertiser. They're the retailer they are the merchant. And in ecommerce by the way it's well known that a marketplace can squeeze out between 15 to 20% of GMV.. Which is? The Growth Merchandise Value. If you run a marketplace and...you're selling goods worth $1 billion you can extract between 15 and 20% of that as an ads tax just by showing ads on top of that marketplace but it comes from the users that customers of the marketplace you and me. So this whole fallacy that ad-supported products are good because they give everything else to us for free is just what it is it is a fallacy. You and I are paying just indirect place and not knowingly. One of the things that's been left unsaid through this whole conversation is that with search you just type in your intent you don't really need to be tracked and the advertiser goes in and tries to match their ads with the keywords you type. They don't really have to know who you are. And in fact a lot of people would say that Google search ads are the least invasive of all ads online... First of all there's no limit to how many ads can be shown to you. By the way it is perfectly legal under current interpretations of antitrust for the entirety of a search result page to only have ads. It's perfectly legit. And the fact that so much of your attention is taken by these ads and you have to make a conscious effort to get past them is a subtle and indirect tax. All of us are more susceptible to having our choices influenced than honestly any of us wants to admit and so how are choices presented to you? We're very suggestible. How are choices presented to you has a huge influence. And so the fact that you have to go through reams and reams of these affects you even if you think it doesn't affect you. I tell people ""I eat what I keep on the surface on my kitchen."" I think I'm full of self-control but honestly I just see what's out there over the long term. So I think there is that effect. The other thing to keep in mind is that keeping track of conversions wherever they happen on the internet having all of the data come back to Google come back to Facebook  is the core part of ads technology. And it is then very difficult to then say that this information is not going to be used to serve ads in other places. To give you a concrete example your searches can be used to show you ads on YouTube they can be used to show you ads on Gmail. And so there is really no limit to how information gets used and this is one of the reasons why we are so adamant about having these core principles for Neeva. Your data is yours we are not going to profit off of the data other than in creating the service that works for you.

Yeah there used to be a firewall between what you searched for on Google and the search ads you were shown and the rest of the business Eventually was broken down. How did that happen? It is a very long and very complicated topic but... Give us the Cliff Notes. The Cliff Notes is roughly that whenever you were signed in across different Google properties it was always okay for that information to get moved around to show you ads that was always part of the equation. There were boundaries that were kept between what happened outside Google and what happened inside Google but information always flowed into Google via the various conversion tracking pixels that there were. Last thing we should talk about is the fact that Google is under some antitrust scrutiny right now because of the way that it's iced out businesses like yours. The Department of Justice is suing Google over how it's paying Apple billions of dollars a year to be the default on the iPhone and iOS. Is it intimidating to you to try to go up against Google now knowing the tactics? Choice is important. Search is the gateway to information for tons and tons of people. So when it comes to Google and search yes I worry about just getting in front of users. We understand that we have a lot more to build — whether it's in terms of personalization or the 1000 features that people have — but I can tell you with a straight face that there is also an amount of joy that people get when they use Neeva that feeling of relaxation ""Oh wow I'm not getting stressed out by lots of stuff"" is also very real. So I worry about having the chance to get in front of you to get in front of 100 other people like you and say like ""Hey give us a chance. If you think it's worthwhile pay If not that's also fine."" To me that is the important part and the DOJ case at least gets to the heart of it which is how does a monopoly not prevent others from even being able to compete? It is a fair chance that I want for you. The DOJ is taking on Google in terms of its search distribution deals. Where do you think this all leads? Because these hearings could go on forever the cases could go on forever but do you as a business owner that could really use a little bit of help anticipate it's ever going to show up? The scrutiny helps I think it heightens awareness that these are real issues. Do I expect an actual outcome in this? No not anytime soon. But the scrutiny helps it gives us that little bit of a chance.

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show to promote his new essay collection Yearbook Rogen said that Cage had expressed interest in appearing in the movie with him.

Cage’s first idea recalled Rogen was to appear as a bald character with hair tattooed onto his cranium. He then allegedly came up with another concept: “A white Jamaican guy.”

“It set off a lot of alarms to us” Rogen said. “Not that a white Jamaican guy is bad but doing the accent and all that stuff seemed like a world of trouble.”

Rogen said Sony chief Amy Pascal invited him and Cage to her house to discuss the role where Cage then recited a monologue in a Jamaican accent.

“We were all just like what’s happening?” he said. “A monologue I should add that was not in the script – nor did it have anything to do with the script. At which point I was like ‘I don’t think he’s read the script!’ There was no indication he had any idea what film we were trying to make other than it was called The Green Hornet and there was a villain in it.”

The Independent has contacted Nicolas Cage’s representatives for comment.

Also in the radio interview Rogen described a “bizarre” meeting he had with Tom Cruise in which the actor allegedly tried to convince him of the merits of Scientology.

The following Is a transcript of Big Technology Podcast edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts Spotify or your app of choice. Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Neeva an ads-free search engine he helped found after running Google's ads and commerce business. Ramaswamy spent seventeen years inside Google  and eventually grew disillusioned with its ad business. Now he's trying to build the solution with $77.5 million in funding. In this conversation we discuss his evolving view on advertising what decoupling search from ads allows from a product standpoint and how the current antitrust environment is opening Google up to competition. Alex Kantrowitz: Google where you used to work — they call it Alphabet now — made $31.9 billion in search ad sales last quarter alone up from $24.5 billion in Q1 2020. YouTube ad sales were up 49% to $6 billion in Q1. This growth is going to hit a ceiling one would imagine? Sridhar Ramaswamy: That will happen when digital advertising is most all of advertising and we have not quite hit the ceiling yet. We've hit ceilings in a number of areas like smartphone sales — year on year it's not really growing significantly — but he move to online advertising is part of the way there. Yet you're building a search engine with no ads? In the history of business there has never been a company that's commanded 90+ percent market share in a market that's $100+ billion. If you look art previous cases of what has disrupted them? It is typically a subscription play. What did HBO do to Time Warner? What did Netflix do to ad-supported television? What did Amazon Prime do to traditional e-commerce? The common theme is the subscription model. Back to my earlier point about how smartphone sales have tapered off Apple has actually not grown revenue significantly but its subscription business and stock are growing because it has invested more and more into services and subscriptions. So Neeva is an entirely subscription-based search engine trying to follow this pattern? The ads model has always gotten disrupted. I know from both personal experience and the enormous amount of user studies that we have done that there is resentment about it. So we wanted to create Neeva as a product that catered only to customers and was very very strict about things like not having ads in it. To us subscription search was the way to create a superior product. And having really squeaky clean business principles — not just no ads but no affiliate links ever no data getting packaged and sold ever being privacy-first — all of those are consequences of the model where we say ""We want to create the best product for you."" So is your product going to be a nice luxury product — privacy for the rich — or do you think it can be something that will appeal to the masses? And if so why? Our aspiration is to be a product that everybody will want. Search is something that people do a dozen times a day there are not many things that people go back to time and time and time again. We think of ourselves as creating a daily-use product without any worries without any gadgets so we think will be able to price this at a point where lots of people really really get value from it and will pay for it. Scott Galloway who wrote ""The Four"" compares Google to God. It used to be you would ask God ""When will my sick kid be healed?"" Now you type the symptoms into Google. I suppose it doesn't occur to us that when we're speaking to our god stand-in we're speaking to an advertiser at the same time. You know something? The ad-supported model even for queries like that sick child tends to favor high engagement sites that have figured out how to get your attention and how to cram a lot of ads. In fact I joke to people that anytime I do a medical search and go to a medical health site generally my conclusion is like ""I have a serious problem and I'm dying.""

watch now

I went to WebMD a little while ago and it was for scratchy throat and WebMD was like ""Well you may just have the common cold or you might have Ebola."" It's the same as clickbait. It's the system that is working as it is designed On those queries the features we at Neeva think about are ""How do we surface government website? How do we surface high authority websites and not the ones that are chasing after clicks?"" Part of the benefit of the subscription model is that it can focus a lot more on what is authoritative what is higher quality information for you. Okay but isn't the purpose of Google to get you useful results so that you just keep coming back? The answer depends on what queries you're thinking about. When it comes to commercial queries the algorithm is now optimized towards showing your results in which you click on ads and those are the ones that are taking up more and more of the space. One of the ways in which you get that growth is by taking that extra line and search ads over the years have gone from taking 3% of the result on the page to 10% 20%. I joke to people if you search on a place like yahoo.com even on a large screen you only see ads. And so there is now this very strong incentive to show you results that are ads. And ads are a conflict of interest for the search engine. Should they show you an ad or should they show you the best result? It'll surprise you to know that one of the biggest feature asks that we have are things like ""I want to control what retailers I see. I do not want to see big retailers when I search. I want smaller retailers. If I'm looking for clothing I only want to be shown stores that make a commitment to ethically sourcing their material."" Not showing the top retailer in the country is not an option for an ad-driven search engine. For us it's a feature we must build because that's what keeps you as a customer. Right because that top retailer is also going to be a top advertiser for Google. That's right. You also allow people to also tailor the news results they want to see. On NFL draft weekend I was searching for the Jets picks and Neeva let me decided whether I want to see more ESPN or more of the fan blogs when I search. That struck me as a cool feature — now I have some more control in terms of what I'm seeing when I search — is that intentional? That's 100% intentional. Giving you agency over the search results is one of the things that we focus on a lot. The other features we have built around personalization being able to bring your personal data into a safe environment where you can search. Lots of us have multiple email accounts multiple [Google] Drive-like accounts I was talking to someone I think that had nine email accounts that they connected to their Neeva account because they were like ""Yeah how am I going to search through all of them?"" So things like personalization giving you agency is very much a core part of the product. And in some ways we are impatient about the tech that we have to build because we want to be able to support things like this more and more. With news we worry about things like filter bubbles. We have ideas for how we present different perspectives. In a couple of months I want to be able to come back to you and say ""Hey Alex you're a public personality would you be open to having your news preferences be available to any nearby user so they can see the world the way you see it?"" Oh that's interesting. I often have diametrically opposite viewpoints on my screen. I like looking at CNN on one side and Fox News on the other side and going ""This is the same country this is my country. Let's see what's here."" It goes back to this thing of — you have choice and we should make it possible for you to exercise choice in different ways. I was going to ask you the filter bubble question but you preempted me. The most basic layer of this is to pick your news sites. But then one level deeper than that is starting to pick viewpoints — do you want the left or the right view? Or do you want a particular person's view? We relate to people we don't relate to abstract concepts. So you want to see the world that Alex does or David Brooks? To me that's super cool. We are a signed-in product we are a subscription product I'm not ashamed of either of these. I believe capitalism should enable great products at scale so I don't think of ourselves as creating somehow this elitist premium product. You pay for it but that makes the product better that allows us to serve you better. And along the way we want to be able to build the features that make the product your own. Could any of this stuff happen at Google? Because I imagine Google allowing people to customize the publishers that they get or making decisions about what type of publications to show would be a little bit tricky… Google can do anything. It's an enormously powerful enormously successful company. But then people ask me ""Why did you not want to do this within Google?"" The answer is that sometimes principles have to be thought over from the ground up and a successful company is necessarily and correctly hesitant about what it sees as heretical ideas. And so this is the reason why I felt it was really important that I press the reset button in my life. Some things are easy but will Google ever really want to create a completely ads-free product in which you can customize everything? I say they can do everything but at this point in their history with all the antitrust stuff it is also going to look very odd if they were to do that right now. I think this is one of those classic cases where success hinges on a set of parameters that are going to become hard to change especially after you achieve what $120 billion of success. That's a lot of dollars speaking here. When you talk about ""heretical ideas"" would it be a heretical to bring this ads-free idea up inside Google? I've done many of these things before. Even the move that we made to have desktop and mobile advertising be a single concept we call this enhanced campaigns this was like 2013 2014.... Inside Google? Inside Google. And it is just so hard to pull off because you have people that are wedded to one way of doing things. I was in charge of making all of the shopping property into a paid property. So I've gone through these changes but some changes are extra super hard. I want to hear a little bit more about your personal story. We talked a little bit about how ads have started to fill up more and more of the Google page. This happened under... My watch. So did it happen slowly where you started to say ""Maybe this isn't the right way to do search"" or did it happen all at once? I was the exec in charge of many of the increases in ad load there was an expectation of a certain amount of growth there were a set of techniques that were available for how you increased growth you're always very thoughtful about the trade-offs implied by growth. There came a certain point in time that when it came to the overall ad ecosystem I said ""I don't want to be working on that anymore."" I'm an accidental ads person I had nothing to do with ads before I joined Google. I joke to people my first boss found the word ""database"" in my resume and sent me to work on the ad system that was the reason why I've worked on ads for 15 years.

If you look at the math of how Google works a vanishing fraction of people work on Google search...The size of the Google Ads team and the Google Ads product team dwarfs that of the search team. Sridhar Ramaswamy Neeva CEO former Google Ads boss

This idea of Neeva came later. We love the problem with a different model it can be a powerful differentiator. I started the subscription business initially as ""This is the best way to provide alignment between you the customer and as the provider."" But then you learn all of these other qualities that they bring. 100% of your team is focused on creating the product. If you look at the math of how Google works a vanishing fraction of people work on Google search. And you would think like ""How can that be?"" But that's the reality the size of the Google Ads team and the Google Ads product team dwarfs that of the search team. The Google ads team's bigger than the search team? 100%. Wild. And if you take the ads business team and the ads product and engineering teams they're way larger than the search team. Obviously people are going to look at it as competitive to your old employer. Did you worry about relationships there or how it might be received? What has the feedback been from your former colleagues? I obviously do worry about it I have a lot of close relationships with a lot of people at Google. And I would roughly say that feedback falls into two buckets one set of people that go like ""Yeah we understand why you're doing this and why you didn't think you could do this within Google."" And a different set that goes ""We wish really you had done this within Google because if anyone could have changed what Google was it should have been you."" Both are reasonable points of view and there are some people that don't just want to deal with it this is all too much for them and I respect those points of view but at some level one has to be driven by what one sees is the right long-term outcome. I personally do not think of ad-supported free products as being good for consumers good for our country in the long term because it is very hard for them to stay true to what you and I want as users and as customers of these products. That conflict of interest is just really really unavoidable. And the fact of the matter Alex is that while at one level the products are free all the benefits of scale for products like this they go to the creator of the product they don't come to you and me. When it comes to Neeva for example I talk about charging a subscription of like $5 to $10 at most per month. Okay so we got the price… And as we gain scale I expect the product to actually get cheaper over time. When you start with a free product the product does not get any freer for you all the benefits of scale go to the creator of the product. So in many ways I actually see these as not even working with the same principles of capitalism that's worked so well for us as a country and honestly as a globe for the last 100 200 years. And so we think a back to basics of ""You're the customer you pay for the product in the long term it's going to give us better products than free products that basically they all charge the advertiser."" And do you know who then turns and gives you and me a higher price? The advertiser. They're the retailer they are the merchant. And in ecommerce by the way it's well known that a marketplace can squeeze out between 15 to 20% of GMV.. Which is? The Growth Merchandise Value.

What's trending this morning:

Amazon has a goal to get rid of a certain percentage of employees every year – and three managers told Insider they felt so much pressure to meet the goal that they hired people just to fire them:

""We might hire people that we know we're going to fire just to protect the rest of the team"" one manager said.

The practice is informally called ""hire to fire"" in which managers hire people internally or externally they intend to fire within a year just to help meet their annual turnover target called unregretted attrition (URA). A manager's URA target is the percentage of employees the company wouldn't regret seeing leave one way or the other.

The existence of the practice in at least some parts of the company shows how Amazon's system of requiring managers to hit a target attrition goal every year can foster controversial norms and practices.

James Charles' former producer and creative director Kelly Rocklein is speaking out about her lawsuit against him which alleges wrongful termination disability discrimination failure to provide reasonable accommodation and failure to pay minimum wage for overtime hours worked:

In addition to working her more than 80 hours a week without overtime pay according to Rocklein and her complaint Rocklein said Charles seemed ""incredibly unprofessional.""

""Imagine having to go over and essentially pick James up out of bed tell him to brush his teeth tell him 'OK what do you want to eat? OK someone is coming to do your laundry. OK I'm going to get your laundry I guess. OK time to start filming – you don't want to film – well we both know you have to. So please let's think about it'"" Rocklein said.

She also said Charles walked around the house naked in front of her called Rocklein names like ""bitch"" and once texted her ""Kelly i might need your help shaving my butt"" in preparation for a revealing Coachella outfit. Rocklein said Charles made her feel ""extremely uncomfortable.""

Take a look at everything that led to the lawsuit:

In the wake of intense internal debate about issues of race Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke sent an email to managers outlining the company's core beliefs. In it he made clear what the company is not – it is not a government he said and it ""cannot solve every societal problem"":

In the email he said that ""endless Slack trolling victimhood thinking us-vs-them divisiveness and zero sum thinking"" amounted to a ""threat"" that breaks teams. He encouraged managers to stay focused on Shopify's mission of empowering online commerce and entrepreneurship.

A Shopify spokesperson told Insider that the company was not trying to emulate Basecamp in its handling of political issues and that it welcomed discussion of current events.

""As Shopify is growing quickly with new team members joining every day our executive team will often send company-wide messages to remind the organization of our vision for equitable entrepreneurship and to reignite our spirit of positive collaboration"" the spokesperson said. ""This reinforces our need to work together in creating a future that unites not divides.""

Wells Fargo; Samantha Lee



More than 20 top mortgage lenders at Wells Fargo have left in the past year while four of the bank's elite President's Club members have left since December. Five current and former mortgage bankers described a culture of heavy oversight and clunky technology that limited their ability to do business:

Tom Goyda a Wells Fargo spokesperson said the exits are due to the competitiveness of the market for mortgage talent.

""We've been in a very competitive mortgage market and top-producing loan offers are in high demand across the industry"" Goyda said. ""Wells Fargo has hired top producers from other lenders and some of our home mortgage consultants have moved to other firms.""

But the mortgage bankers who spoke with Insider pointed to excessive red tape clunky legacy technology and the Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap as factors that stymied loan growth and led them to quit.

Amazon may currently be engaged in a widespread effort to suppress the availability of Christian and conservative books on its search engine.

Conservative thinker and Catholic convert Sohrab Ahmari recently released his new book “The Unbroken Thread: Discovering the Wisdom of Tradition” on May 11. The book seeks to reintroduce modern readers to the wisdom of Western tradition.

A description for the book states “For millennia the world’s great ethical and religious traditions taught that true happiness lies in pursuing virtue and accepting limits. But now unbound from these stubborn traditions we are free to choose whichever way of life we think is most optimal—or more often than not merely the easiest.”

However the book has currently disappeared entirely from Amazon’s search engine.

In a tweet early Saturday morning Ahmari wrote “My new book ‘THE UNBROKEN THREAD: DISCOVERING THE WISDOM OF TRADITION’ has disappeared from Amazon search results. You can still find the product if you have the exact link but it doesn’t show up in search. Big Tech and Bezos are at war with my ideas.”

A search performed by The Daily Citizen confirms that Ahmari’s book has disappeared. When we searched “The Unbroken Thread Sohrab Ahmari” the top search result was for sewing thread: “Sewing Thread – Military Grade Bonded Nylon Thread for Leather Stitching Canvas Repair & More.”

The second search result was for “12 Colors Sewing Thread Assortment Coil Polyester Thread Sewing Line Portable Plastic Tube All Purpose Polyester Thread for Hand and Machine Sewing.”

A second book that seems to have magically gone missing is conservative radio host Mark Levin’s new book “American Marxism.” After a search on Amazon for “Mark Levin American Marxism” the book was not among the results. Levin’s book had sat atop Amazon’s best seller list for two weeks since his book was first announced.

Also disappeared from Amazon’s search engine is conservative Rod Dreher’s book “Live Not By Lies.”

A source at Amazon told The Daily Citizen that the issue was intermittent and not specific to any category.

However here’s the question many are asking at this point: Is Amazon’s removal of “The Unbroken Thread” and other Christian and conservative books an honest mistake? Or is this yet another instance of big tech censorship?

Ahmari believes that with Amazon’s history of banning conservative books this action was intentional.

“Having gone through what we at The Post went through with Big Tech censorship and witnessing what happened with Ryan Anderson’s book I’m sorry but there’s no way I’m giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt when my book disappears from search results within a week of launch” Ahmari wrote on Twitter.

In a statement to The Daily Citizen an Amazon spokesperson said “We are aware some customers are having issues with search results and we are working to resolve this as quickly as possible.”

For Christians it has become the new normal for large powerful tech corporations to censor and silence their voices. In the past few months we have seen Twitter ban The Daily Citizen for reporting biological fact and Amazon ban Ryan T. Anderson’s book discussing transgender ideology.

The ability of these companies to limit freedom of speech and religious liberty is difficult to overstate and should not be taken lightly by any American.

In a lot of ways Tom Clancy was ahead of his time with his many novels that took place within a shared universe — as opposed to just doing a bunch of more traditional sequel stories like most novel series do — but the film adaptations were always one-offs that never really added up to anything as a whole. But that could very well be changing now as Amazon and Paramount might be in the process of firing up a Clancyverse built to more modern standards starting with the “Jack Ryan” series and now with “Without Remorse.” But there’s a big catch that we’ll discuss further down.

If a Clancyverse is indeed in the card it’s starting with a two-pronged approach first with “Jack Ryan” focusing on well John Krasinski’s Jack Ryan and now with “Without Remorse” introducing the man who will become John Clark — played in past films by Willem Defoe and Liev Schrieber and now getting the Michael B. Jordan treatment.

We’re still in the early stages of this whole deal — “Jack Ryan” and “Without Remorse” have no characters in common at all. But “Jack Ryan” will get its third season later this year and “Without Remorse” ends with a pretty clear sequel tease for a “Rainbow Six” movie.

“Without Remorse” does however include a direct line to “Jack Ryan” thanks to an original character who is related to a major character from Tom Clancy’s novels who has featured prominently in most of the Jack Ryan-focused movie adaptations as well as the “Jack Ryan” show. That new character is Karen Greer played by Jodie Turner-Smith — the niece of one Jim Greer.

Most folks know James Earl Jones as the face of Greer since he played the character in “The Hunt for Red October” “Patriot Games” and “Clear and Present Danger.” Morgan Freeman then played what is generally considered to be a reworked version of the same character named William Cabot in “The Sum of All Fears.” And these days Wendell Pierce has been taking on the role in “Jack Ryan.”

Given that “Without Remorse” does not make any other reference to characters from “Jack Ryan” or anything that happened on that show we can’t even really begin to guess at the significance of Karen Greer’s existence. For now it just feels like a nod to the greater franchise but in such a small way that her appearance doesn’t come with any promises about what’s coming next.

That’s smart. While that “Rainbow Six” movie and another season of “Jack Ryan” are on the way it’s probably for the best to see how things go before jumping straight to the big crossovers — we saw how well that worked out for the DC film universe.

We should point out that “Without Remorse” was not as far as we know conceived as being part of a shared universe with “Jack Ryan.” The film was originally slated for a theatrical release from Paramount and it only ended up with Amazon because the pandemic closed most theaters for a year. It’s possible then that Turner-Smith’s character was not originally even supposed to be Jim Greer’s niece. Aside from the one mention of her uncle Karen Greer’s family relations have no bearing on this story at all and that’s a detail that could easily have been added in reshoots or post-production.

That bit of info sparks a bunch of new questions but the main one is about whether “Without Remorse” actually represents the beginnings of a streaming Clancyverse or if Paramount will continue on these Michael B. Jordan movies out as their own separate thing in theaters. That’s a question we don’t have any answers for just yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2F3cy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2Jsb2dzL210L2RldGVjdGluZy1yZW1lZGlhdGluZy1wcm9jZXNzLWlzc3Vlcy1vbi1lYzItaW5zdGFuY2VzLXVzaW5nLWFtYXpvbi1jbG91ZHdhdGNoLWF3cy1zeXN0ZW1zLW1hbmFnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detecting and remediating process issues on EC2 instances using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Systems Manager ...,"Customers want to have visibility into processes running inside their Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Critical processes and services in these instances can crash unexpectedly and when they do it’s crucial for customers to be notified so they can maintain continued business operations.

There are multiple ways to see if a service is running as expected. One way is to instrument the application code to send heartbeats to an observer process at certain intervals. Applications can also expose a liveness or readiness endpoint that can be polled by external monitoring systems to check if it is running and functioning properly. In cases where you don’t want to introduce more observability logic into your application it’s a common practice to write operating system scripts to watch for the liveness of specific processes. But as an alternative to writing custom scripts you can use the Amazon CloudWatch agent procstat plugin which continuously watches specified processes and reports their metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. After the data is in Amazon CloudWatch you can associate alarms to trigger actions like notifying teams or remediations like restarting the processes resizing the instances and so on.

In this blog post I’ll show you how to use AWS Systems Manager Run Command on EC2 instances to restart the processes that the procstat plugin detected were down.

System architecture

By completing the steps in this post you can create a system that uses the following architecture.

An EC2 instance with the Amazon CloudWatch agent installed pushes metrics data to Amazon CloudWatch.

The procstat plugin collects process metrics. As long as the process is running inside the instance the plugin will continuously monitor the specified metrics.

You’ll add a CloudWatch alarm on one of these metrics and set its missing data policy to Treat missing data as bad (breaching threshold) to trigger an alarm condition.

to trigger an alarm condition. When the process is stopped or crashed on the instance the alarm goes into the In alarm A notification is sent to the specified Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic which is consumed by an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function extracts the hostname attribute from the payload and looks it up through the Amazon EC2 API to find its instance ID. This ID is required in the API call.

A notification is sent to the specified Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic which is consumed by an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function extracts the hostname attribute from the payload and looks it up through the Amazon EC2 API to find its instance ID. This ID is required in the API call. AWS Lambda then issues a Run Command API call against AWS Systems Manager to initiate the execution of a shell command ( service sshd restart ) on the instance which restarts the stopped service.

The architecture for this system is shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1: Architecture showing EC2 instance pushing metric data to Amazon CloudWatch

Deploy the stack

To deploy the sample architecture in your AWS environment use the AWS CloudFormation template included with this post.

The template creates the following resources in your account:

A VPC and private subnet.

An EC2 instance with the Amazon Linux 2 operating system.

Multiple VPC endpoints.

An Amazon SNS topic.

A Lambda function with a subscription to the SNS topic.

Other supporting resources such as security groups and IAM roles.

To start your deployment use the following link.

After deployment the stack will provide you the EC2 instance ID in its outputs section. The AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is installed on Amazon Linux instances. The template you deployed performed the network and security configuration required for SSM Agent to communicate with AWS Systems Manager. This means you can use SSM Agent to install software on this instance. You can also install the SSM Agent manually using scripts or configuration management tools like Chef Puppet or Ansible.

Use Systems Manager to install the CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instance

Open the AWS Systems Manager console and from the left navigation pane choose Run Command. On the Commands page choose Run command to add a command. In Command document type AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage to find and select the document.

Figure 2: Command document page in the Systems Manager console

In Command parameters for Name enter AmazonCloudWatchAgent .

Figure 3: Command parameters

In Targets select the Choose instances manually In the real world you might want to specify instance tags to select EC2 instances or resource groups.

Figure 4: Choose instances manually

If you want to export the command output to an S3 bucket in Output options select the Write command output to an S3 bucket box and enter an S3 destination bucket. Leave the other parameters at their defaults. Choose Run. You can watch the command’s progress from the Commands

After the status transitions to Success you can configure the CloudWatch agent.

Configure the CloudWatch agent

To configure the agent connect to the EC2 instance. Because this instance is deployed in a private subnet you must use Systems Manager to connect to it.

In the Amazon EC2 console choose your EC2 instance and then choose Connect. On the Session Manager tab choose Connect to establish the connection.

Figure 5: Session Manager tab in the EC2 console

After the connection is successful create a CloudWatch agent configuration file.

sudo vi /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json

Add the following configuration JSON and then save the file.

{ ""agent"": { ""run_as_user"": ""cwagent"" } ""metrics"": { ""metrics_collected"": { ""procstat"": [ { ""pid_file"": ""/var/run/sshd.pid"" ""measurement"": [ ""cpu_usage"" ""memory_rss"" ] } ] } } }

This configuration enables the procstat plugin and tells it to monitor the sshd process identified by the sshd.pid file. The plugin will monitor the cpu_usage and memory_rss metrics of this process and send information to Amazon CloudWatch.

Now use the following command to start the CloudWatch agent with its new configuration:

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json

This command will configure the amazon-cloudwatch-agent service on this machine where you can start stop and restart with systemctl commands.

Create a CloudWatch alarm

You can observe the newly created namespace and its metrics in the CloudWatch console.

From the left navigation pane choose Metrics. On the All metrics tab in Custom namespaces choose CWAgent to see CWAgent-specific metrics.

Figure 6: Metrics emitted by the CloudWatch agent

Select the checkbox for the procstat_memory_rss metric to observe its data on the metrics graph. Choose the Graphed Metrics tab.

Figure 7: Graphed metrics tab

Under Actions choose the bell icon to open the Create alarm page. In Metric for Period choose 1 minute. Leave the other parameters at their defaults.

Figure 8: Alarm metric parameters

In Conditions complete the fields as shown in Figure 9:

Figure 9: Alarm parameters

These settings tell CloudWatch to go into the In alarm state if the procstat_memory_rss metric value goes lower or equal to 0 or missing data is detected. Note that a memory consumption metric will never go below or equal to zero for a running process so this alarm configuration is practically tracking a missing data situation. Whenever the sshd process is stopped or crashed the operating system will delete its pid file. The CloudWatch agent will detect the deletion and will not emit any metric data as long as the file is missing. This will cause the CloudWatch alarm to go into the In alarm state.

Choose Next to configure actions for this alarm.

Figure 10: Alarm notification parameters

In Notification choose the SNS topic that was created by the CloudFormation template and then choose Next. Enter a name and optional description for the alarm and then choose Next.

Figure 11: Alarm name

Review your alarm configuration and then choose Create alarm. The status displayed for the alarm will be Insufficient Data. When the status changes to OK continue to the next section.

Test your configuration

To test your configuration use Systems Manager to reconnect to your EC2 instance and then issue the following command to make sure the sshd service is already running on the server:

sudo systemctl status sshd

Figure 12: sshd service is running on the instance

Use the following command to stop the service:

sudo systemctl stop sshd

Figure 13: sshd service is stopped on the instance

After the daemon is stopped go to the CloudWatch console to observe the alarm condition. The alarm will go into the In alarm state in about five minutes.

Figure 14: SshdAlarm

When this happens CloudWatch will notify the SNS topic which will then trigger a Lambda function. The Lambda function will fetch the host ID from the SNS message payload and do a lookup against the EC2 API to find the instance ID. It will use this ID to send the Run Command API call. While the Lambda function is executing this operation logs will be created. At this point the sshd service comes back up and the agent will start emitting its metrics. The arrival of metrics will transition the alarm state back to OK.

In the CloudWatch console check the alarm until it goes into the OK state reconnect to the EC2 instance and then use the following command to check the service status.

sudo systemctl status sshd

Observe the active status of the process in the output of the command.

Figure 15: sshd service is running on the instance

Cleanup

To clean up the resources you created in your account open the AWS Cloudformation console and delete the stack. Open the CloudWatch console and delete the alarm and log group where the Lambda function’s logs are stored.

Conclusion

The Amazon CloudWatch agent can be used on your EC2 instances and on-premises servers. It provides a reliable way to collect process liveness information. This way customers can be notified when critical processes and services go down unexpectedly which will allow them to take remedial actions for continued business operations.

In this blog post I showed you how to build fully automated processes that can detect and act upon service or process crashes using AWS System Manager Run Command. The architecture used includes the procstat plugin to monitor processes metrics. An alarm attached to this metric was triggered because of a missing data indicating a crashed process. This alarm then triggered a Lamda function to issue the Run Command to restart the process if there is an issue.

You can watch critical processes and services in your servers and remediate them quickly by using these AWS automation capabilities.

I’m routinely amazed by their techniques and perseverance both of which are necessary to produce excellent journalism.

Paris’s efforts around her five-month investigation into the safety of Amazon’s highway trucking expansion were nothing short of impressive. And since I enjoyed the very small part I played in her journey (shared much more by her wonderful editor Nick Wingfield) I thought I would reveal some of it to you by interviewing Paris.

You may be surprised to learn how these stories actually come together as well as the issues we’re still trying to pin down.

Jessica: How did you get onto this story?

Paris: I was working on a story we published in November about Amazon’s expansion into trucking and I somehow stumbled upon a commercial motor vehicle enforcement report from the Vermont Department of Transportation. Some Vermont fuel association had published copies of the agency’s enforcement reports and one of them said something like “All these Amazon pop-up companies are frequently out of compliance.”

I thought if this is happening in Vermont where there are no Amazon warehouses what’s happening in Texas or California where they have a billion? It turns out what is happening is these horrible crashes and these terrible events that are connected to Amazon trucking but are not connected to Amazon from a liability perspective because they are technically independent companies.

If the companies are independent how could you identify that the trucks responsible for the crashes you wrote about were carrying freight for Amazon?

This is what took the most time and was the hardest part. Normally in commercial trucking there is a license associated with a trucking company and regulators attach accidents to that license. But because Amazon predominantly uses independent companies the accidents go under those companies’ license numbers instead of Amazon’s.

What I ended up doing was tied to the fact Amazon has 30000 of its own branded trailers—because it wants billboards on wheels. I would find photos of Amazon trailers that had been involved in crashes or descriptions in police and news reports.

I scoured public records and local news reports for vehicular homicide as well as strangely the Twitter accounts of sheriffs’ departments and highway patrols and I ended up following the trail of Amazon branding and Amazon packages. In some cases a tractor would fall over a vehicle and Amazon packages would fall out of it.

Tell us about the big court cases coming up.

One of the cases that is worth paying attention to involves an Amazon Freight Partner one of a number of companies that has agreed to haul loads exclusively for Amazon in an Amazon-branded tractor. Amazon provides the vehicle and the driver is an employee of this small company.

In one of the cases I mention in the story a truck driver drove off the road and over the median killing one man and severely injuring another. It appears to be the first time Amazon has faced a legal challenge when it owns the vehicle and has gone from having a lot of control to having even more control. The program helps these contractors get off the ground Amazon is their sole client and they have almost total control over how they operate and the money they can earn while using Amazon vehicles.

The case is in the state of Florida which allows the owner of the vehicle to be held at least partially liable for the actions of its driver. In past litigation Amazon was able to weasel its way out of any responsibility; in this case it may be harder for Amazon to do that completely and it could set precedents for future cases.

How did Amazon respond?

It was interesting. I worked with Amazon’s trucking public relations quite a bit in our reporting. I put a lot of work into a number of direct questions I sent them and we ended up getting a single on-the-record statement and some background after weeks of back and forth that didn’t answer the questions so that was a bit frustrating. So hopefully as we continue to report on this it will get a bit easier.

What went unanswered in your reporting?

One of the first questions I asked Amazon: Do you track the number of accidents drivers hauling your freight are involved in?

I never got an answer one way or another as simple a question as that is. We also didn’t get answers as to Amazon’s overall accident rate which is frustrating because there is no way to have a direct comparison to other companies because of the decentralized nature of the system. That is a frustrating question to be left with.

This is an industrywide problem that began with trucking deregulation in the 1970s. Every e-commerce company is trying to find a way to deal with it. Consumers won’t buy something if it takes 20 days to arrive and they won’t buy it if shipping costs $20. It often ends with this unclear liability question. It’s hard to pinpoint liability."

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Milan (MXP) since April 2 and on flights from JFK to Rome (FCO) as of May 8. With the recent change in Italy’s travel restrictions any customers whether traveling for leisure or essential business are eligible to fly on American’s flights from New York to Italy starting May 16.

Prior to travel customers will need to provide proof of the required negative COVID-19 test and also upon arrival in Milan or Rome. After taking a second test at the airport producing a negative result travelers will not need to quarantine in Italy.

American currently offers daily flights between JFK and MXP and three-times weekly service to FCO. American also operates four-times weekly service between Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and FCO and expects those flights to become quarantine-free and open to all travelers in the coming days.

They are going to be smaller with fewer items heated. And expect the bread to be served room temperature though I’m not sure how they expect you to spread butter on rolls that haven’t been warmed. That’s according to explanations that were given to employees at question and answer sessions held last week by airline President Robert Isom recordings of which were reviewed by View From The Wing.

Jodi Spicer American’s Managing Director of Onboard Dining and Service explained that “for the longer term…let’s not just bring back everything that we had prior. This is a unique opportunity for us to look at what do our customers value and what’s easiest for [flight attendants]?”

Here are some more of the explanations she offered around what to expect for first class meals going forward

“The team is looking at ways where we can introduce a cold service on shorter flights with maybe only one hot component and other options that bread that maybe doesn’t need to be warmed.”

“We were thinking about during the pandemic how can we come up with something that our customers value but that [flight attendants who want to limit contact with customers] feel comfortable serving? This is our fresh bites if you haven’t flown a 2200 mile flight that’s where these are flying now and later this summer we’ll be expanding to other mileage bands…we have 16 versions of these boxes.”

“The idea here is: easy to serve value quality maybe not as much quantity. Making it look a little bit different in our delivery methods.”

“Our customers’ expectations have just changed entirely…you’re gonna see in the fall..it might be a little lighter fare and only at those longer distances will you see those traditional stay setup meals. Doesn’t mean that we’re going to go on the cheap side but just change the look make it more valuable and quality versus quantity…hopefully later this year.”

Vice President of Flight Service Brady Byrnes explained their focus has been to “greatly reduce our customer touch points inflight some of our major competitors continued beverage services even in main cabin we didn’t think that was right for our colleagues or our customers.” He also offered that “when we re-introduce elements of our service moving forward will it be different? Yes. Should it be different? Absolutely.”

Talking to pilots about crew meals – and crew meals generally track first class passenger meals – they noted that “later this summer…some other things on the docket that will come forward for some shorter flights in the 900 mile range.”

The head of inflight service head at the time who made the decision to eliminate inflight meals in the first place stated that the airline wouldn’t ever bring back the old first class meals and instead would offer something that still “has a premium feel but is different and more modern.” We’re now getting of an inkling of how that works out in practice.

They seem to think that customers want less interaction with crew and that translates as reduced meal service. However

Cold food doesn’t mean less contact with passengers than hot food. Ovens haven’t been shown to be a vector of spread for Covid-19 .

. Less food means more contact not less for customers. That’s because passengers still need to eat they just have to forage in the crowded airport instead of having it brought to them on board.

Ultimately for passengers and crew who are vaccinated there’s limited concern about the pandemic. And quality hot meals don’t involve more contact than delivering better meals on a single tray. When the person delivering the message about the plan for future meals has to proactively offer that this isn’t about being “on the cheap side” you know that this is about being on the cheap side.

United Airlines just announced that they’re bringing some meals back to domestic flight class focusing on flights over 1500 miles and flights between the airline’s hubs that are 800 miles or more. These comments from American Airlines about inflight meals were made right as United was making their announcement on Wednesday. I have to think American will respond competitively albeit with a little less at a minimum they need to match meals on routes where both United and American offer non-stop service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTUvZXRpaGFkLWFpcndheXMtYW5kLWZseWR1YmFpLWNhbmNlbC10ZWwtYXZpdi1mbGlnaHRzLWFzLXVhZS1leHByZXNzZXMtZ3JhdmUtY29uY2Vybi1hdC1pc3JhZWwtY29uZmxpY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Etihad Airways and flydubai Cancel Tel Aviv Flights as UAE Expresses ""Grave Concern"" at Israel Conflict","Etihad Airways and flydubai have temporarily halted all flights to Tel Aviv joining a slew of American and European airlines who have already nixed flights to Israel over security fears arising from an escalating conflict in the region.

After the likes of American Airlines Delta and United Airlines first cancelled flights to Israel last Wednesday Etihad Airways said it would keep flying between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi but would “monitor the situation”.

A statement posted to the airline’s website now said it would halt flights to Israel from Sunday onwards. “Etihad is monitoring the situation in Israel and continues to maintain close contact with authorities and security intelligence providers” the airline said.

flydubai has also axed all of its services to Israel as the conflict with the militant Palestinian group Hamas intensified over the weekend.

Direct flights between the UAE and Israel only recently became possible after the shock announcement last August that the two countries would normalize relations for the first time in their respective histories.

The deal was forged during talks brokered by the Trump administration in what was seen as a major development for political relations in the Middle East.

flydubai launched flights between Dubai and Tel Aviv last November while Etihad Airways only started operating flights in April. Emirates Airline was planning to launch its own flights to Tel Aviv next month.

Last week Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport was briefly shut after Hamas fired a volley of rockets towards the airport. Passengers and staff were forced to run for cover and planes bound for Tel Aviv had to divert into holding patters away from the fighting.

Israel is protected by the Iron Dome system which can shoot down rockets fired into its territory by Hamas but the system isn’t foolproof and some rockets have been able to evade interception.

Many European airlines including British Airways and Iberia cancelled flights to Israel on Thursday fearing a repeat of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 which was shot from the sky by an anti-aircraft missile over Ukraine in 2014.

The UAE’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan expressed his “grave concern over the escalating spiral of violence in Israel and Palestine” on Saturday and called for the “immediate cessation of violence and hostilities”.

“The events of the past week have been a somber reminder of the urgent need for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation. We reflect on the promise that the Abraham Accords hold for current and future generations to live with their neighbors in peace dignity and prosperity” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9oYXdrZXItc2lkZGVsZXktdHJpZGVudC1zdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Story Of The Hawker Siddeley Trident,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9oYXdrZXItc2lkZGVsZXktdHJpZGVudC1zdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNqLXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvaGlzdG9yeS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L25vdGFibGUtZXZlbnRzLWRheS1oaXN0b3J5LzUwMzA2NzcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Notable events on this day in history,"The Associated Press

___

BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on the U.N. Security Council to seek an early de-escalation of violence between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers. He also blamed the U.S. for the council’s lack of action so far.

“Regrettably the council has so far failed to reach an agreement with the United States standing on the opposite side of international justice” the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Wang as saying in a phone conversation Saturday with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.

He expressed support for a two-state solution and said China which holds the Security Council presidency this month expects all parties to speak with a unified voice when the council discusses the conflict later Sunday.

Wang said the Security Council should reconfirm a two-state solution and urge Palestinians and Israelis to resume talks on that basis as soon as possible.

GAZA CITY Gaza Strip — Israeli warplanes have struck several buildings and roads in a vital part of Gaza City early Sunday.

According to photos circulated by residents and journalists the airstrikes created a crater that blocked one of the main roads leading to Shifa the largest hospital in the strip.

The Health Ministry said the latest airstrikes left at least two dead and 25 wounded including children and women. It said rescuers are still digging through the rubble and had so far pulled up five more wounded.

Two hours into the heavy bombardment there has been no comment from the Israeli military.

UNITED NATIONS -- A U.N. spokesman says Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “deeply disturbed” by the Israeli airstrike that destroyed a high-rise building in Gaza City housing offices of several international media organizations and residential apartments and is “dismayed” by the increasing number of civilian casualties.

“The secretary-general reminds all sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Saturday.

Earlier Saturday an Israeli airstrike pulverized a high-rise building that housed The Associated Press Al Jazeera and other media after warning that it was being targeted.

Guterres singled out the death of 10 members of the same family including children as a result of an Israeli airstrike Friday in the al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Saturday.

LOS ANGELES — Hundreds of protesters shut down traffic as they took to the streets of Los Angeles calling for an end to Israeli airstrikes over the Gaza Strip.

The protesters waved flags and signs that said “free Palestine” and shouted “long live intifada” or uprising. They marched from outside the federal building to the Israeli Consulate in the western part of the city on Saturday.

Police shut down traffic on Wilshire Boulevard a major thoroughfare and urged motorists to avoid the area. Police from multiple agencies were monitoring the ongoing demonstration.

Also on Saturday hundreds of protesters gathered in Boston’s Copley Square and walked a short distance through the streets to the location of the Israeli Consulate for New England blocking traffic.

Footage on social media shows protesters then unfurled a banner in the colors of the Palestinian flag with the words “Free Palestine” while standing on top of the awning of the building where the consulate is located.

Other smaller protests in support of Palestinians took place in Hartford and Pittsburgh where footage shows one speaker at the protest called on lawmakers to put restrictions on how Israel can spend aid from the United States.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that the ongoing campaign against Palestinian militants now in its sixth day will “continue as long as needed.”

The prime minister spoke on Saturday from Israel’s defense ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv and issued a warning to leaders of Gaza’s militant Hamas group after a series of airstrikes targeted high-level officials and commanders.

Netanyahu says: “You cannot hide — not above ground and not underground. Nobody is immune.”

The Israeli leader added that there was “no more just or moral campaign” than Israel’s against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and thanked President Joe Biden and other world leaders for their support.

Netanyahu’s remarks came at the end of a day that saw Israeli airstrikes target and destroy a high-rise building in Gaza City that housed offices of The Associated Press and other media outlets. Everyone was safely evacuated from the building before the strike hit.

JERUSALEM — Israel’s Electric Company says that high voltage lines supplying the Gaza Strip with electricity were damaged by rocket fire by Palestinian militants.

The company released a statement on Saturday saying five of the 10 lines have been damaged in the latest escalation of fighting and that the company cannot fix them because there is no access to the area.

Damage to the power lines came amid days of intense fighting between Palestinian militants and Israel in the Gaza Strip.

Gaza’s only other source of electricity — besides the power provided by Israel — is its single power plant which has been working only partially due to fuel shortages. However both sources are insufficient to cover Gazans’ needs.

Outages of at least eight hours have long been a daily occurrence in the strip and with the power plant not working at regular capacity rolling blackouts have increased to 12-15 hours per day recently.

With the latest hits on the power line more outages are expected.

BEIRUT — A top Hamas leader says militant groups in the Gaza Strip will not retreat in the face of attacks by Israeli troops warning that their fighters still haven’t used all their force at their disposal.

Ismail Haniyeh spoke during a rally attended by hundreds in the gas-rich nation of Qatar on Saturday night. He said that “resistance is the shortest road to Jerusalem” and that Palestinians will not accept anything less than a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

He added that “the Zionist enemy struck Gaza flattened towers and carried out massacres” thinking that this will make militant groups retreat. He said that as the Israeli attacks escalate “the resistance will increase (its force) to a higher level.”

Haniyeh also said that despite the fact that Gaza has been under siege for nearly 15 years militant groups will not retreat.

Protesters gathered in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad and the southern provinces of Babylon Dhi Qar Diwanieh and Basra in a show of support. In Baghdad’s central Tahrir Square demonstrators carried a Palestinian flag several feet long. Many also held up photos of al-Sadr.

Al-Sadr is a firebrand cleric who wields significant power in the country. In the May 2018 elections his party won the most number of seats.

BEIRUT — Hundreds of people have participated in the funeral of a Hezbollah fighter who was shot dead along the Lebanon-Israel border during a rally denouncing Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.

The funeral of Mohammed Tahhan was held in his hometown of Adloun in southern Lebanon on Saturday afternoon. The 21-year-old man died of wounds sustained on Friday shortly after he was struck during the protest at the border.

On Saturday scores of Palestinian and Lebanese youth gathered in the border area again to rally against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Lebanese troops detained several people who tried to reach the border wall.

Earlier in the day an Israeli military spokesman warned Lebanese authorities not to allow protesters to breach the border.

A small group had breached the fence on Friday and crossed the border into Israel triggering the shooting. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots toward the group after they sabotaged the fence and crossed over briefly.

BERLIN — The United Nations’ human rights chief is urging all in what has developed into a battle between Israel and Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers to lower tensions and faulted actions by both sides.

Michelle Bachelet the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said in a statement issued in Geneva on Saturday that “rather than seeking to calm tensions inflammatory rhetoric from leaders on all sides appears to be seeking to excite tensions rather than to calm them.”

Bachelet’s statement was issued on Saturday shortly before an Israeli airstrike destroyed a high-rise building in Gaza City that housed offices of The Associated Press and other media outlets.

In the statement Bachelet “warned that the firing of large numbers of indiscriminate rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel including densely populated areas in clear violation of international humanitarian law amounts to war crimes.”

There also are concerns that some attacks by the Israeli military in Gaza “have targeted civilian objects that under international humanitarian law do not meet the requirements to be considered as military objectives.”

It added that “the failure to adhere to the principles of distinction proportionality and precaution in the conduct of military operations amounts to a serious violation of international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes.”

BERLIN — Iran’s foreign minister has called off a planned visit to his Austrian counterpart in Vienna. The decision came after Austria’s chancellery and foreign ministry flew the Israeli flag as a signal of solidarity in Israel’s conflict with the militant Hamas group.

Austrian daily Die Presse reported Saturday that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was due to meet Austrian counterpart Alexander Schallenberg on Saturday morning. But he called off the trip over the Austrian leaders’ decision to fly the Israeli flag on Friday.

The Austria Press Agency said Schallenberg’s spokeswoman Claudia Tuertscher confirmed the report. She said: “We regret this.”

Vienna has been hosting negotiations in recent weeks aimed at bringing the United States back into the 2015 nuclear deal aimed at allaying concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. France Germany Britain Russia and China are still parties to that agreement.

Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi tweeted on Friday that Austria “so far been a great host for negotiations” but it was “shocking & painful to see flag of the occupying regime that brutally killed tens of innocent civilians inc many children in just few days over govt offices in Vienna.”

DUBAI United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia has called for foreign ministers of the world’s largest body of Muslim nations to hold a meeting Sunday. The gathering is to discuss Israeli acts of violence against Palestinians and the Israeli police’s use of force against protesters at Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The kingdom will host the virtual summit gathering ministers of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation “to discuss the Israeli aggression in the Palestinian territory” particularly acts of violence in the vicinity of Al-Aqsa Mosque the body said Saturday.

The Saudi-headquartered OIC includes countries Iran Turkey Indonesia and a range of Muslim majority nations.

The sanctity of Al-Aqsa mosque one of Islam’s holiest sites is a sensitive and emotive issue for Muslims around the world. The OIC was formed 51 years ago in response to a Jewish extremist arson attack on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem.

The hilltop on which the mosque stands is also sacred to Jews who revere it as the Temple Mount because it was the site of the biblical temples. Some Jews and evangelical Christians support building a new Jewish temple on the site an idea that Muslims find alarming because they fear it would lead to the mosque being partitioned or demolished.

RAMALLAH West Bank — Palestinians have begun gathering across the occupied West Bank to mark the anniversary of the displacement of hundreds of thousands of refugees from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.

Nakba Day Arabic for “catastrophe” comes amid widespread Jewish-Arab violence in Israel and heavy fighting between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas which rules Gaza. The main event Saturday was held in West Bank city of Ramallah where the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority is headquartered.

On Friday Palestinians in the occupied West Bank held some of the largest protests in years and clashed with Israeli forces who shot and killed 11 people including a Palestinian who tried to stab a soldier at a military position.

Loading...

Companies don't really need celebrities to sell their products or brand awareness and not every celebrity is appropriate for these assignments. But when the correct talent is able to connect with audiences there is a magic that transcends mere marketing.

Indeed many companies powered their sales thanks to having the right celebrity in their spotlight.

Here are five of the most successful celebrity endorsement spokespersons. Each one offers a sterling lesson of what the right A-list personality can do for a company's image.

Joan Crawford for Pepsi: The glamorous Hollywood star married Alfred Steele CEO of PepsiCo Inc. PEP in Las Vegas in May 1955. During the marriage Steele used Crawford’s star wattage to shine a spotlight on his celebrated soft drink.

Steele died of a heart attack in 1959. His successor Herbert L. Barnet appointed her as the first woman on the company’s board of directors which created a flood of media attention.

Although Crawford’s film career in the 1960s saw a decline into horror-thrillers of varying degrees of quality she still captivated the public as an icon of the Golden Age of Hollywood. She traveled across the U.S. and around the world on behalf of the company appearing in promotional films for Pepsi and greeting investors at business conferences. For this period in time Crawford and Pepsi were synonymous to most consumers.

Not everyone in the Pepsi C-suite was enamored with Crawford – women were a rarity in boardrooms and the old boys in charge liked their gender exclusivity – and she was forced to retire in 1973; the notorious 1981 film “Mommie Dearest” greatly exaggerated this segment of her life. Nonetheless Crawford’s work as a corporate brand ambassador and a board director staked out new territory for women to follow.

Karl Malden for American Express: The Oscar-winning character actor’s career gained an adrenaline shot in 1972 when he landed the lead role as a veteran police detective on the TV crime series “The Streets of San Francisco.” The popularity of the series convinced The American Express Company AXP that Malden’s new persona as a television cop would help promote the safety and security aspects of its travelers checks product.

Beginning in 1973 Malden would appear dressed in the same suit-and-fedora clothing that he wore on “The Streets of San Francisco” while offering micro-dramas of vacationers who abruptly find themselves stranded when their cash is stolen. Malden would explain to the viewer that American Express’ travelers checks could be easily replaced if they were lost or stolen adding the tagline “Don’t Leave Home Without Them” to drive home the point.

Malden’s campaign lasted through 1994 – “The Streets of San Francisco” went off the air in 1977 – and the commercials resonated so greatly in the pop culture that Johnny Carson would frequently parody them on ""The Tonight Show."" In a late-life interview Malden warmly recalled his work with American Express saying “It was a pleasure it was a joy – I loved every minute of it.”

James Garner and Mariette Hartley for Polaroid: This campaign began in 1979 and covered 250 commercials over an eight-year run. Polaroid Corporation initially hired Garner as its spokesperson but his first commercials were too heavy on the salesmanship and lacked charm. The company paired him with Hartley whose career mostly consisted of one-shot roles on TV shows including “Twilight Zone” “Star Trek” and “M*A*S*H*” but she was not a household name.

The commercials offered Garner and Hartley engaging in leisure-time activities – they were on a sailboat anchored in a marina at a stable in a garden unwrapping Christmas decorations – and Garner would photograph Hartley with the Polaroid instant camera. The pair would watch the photograph develop before their eyes all while keeping a good-natured banter.

Many viewers assumed Garner and Hartley were married even though there was nothing in their dialogue to affirm that – Hartley would facetiously acknowledge this public error by creating a t-shirt that read “I am not James Garner’s wife!” Still this was one of the longest running celebrity advertising campaigns of all time and it helped to maintain Polaroid’s market dominance in the pre-digital days.

Michael Jordan for Nike: In 1984 Michael Jordan won a gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympics and was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. His athletic greatness was quickly appreciated but not everyone noticed. Johnson had hoped to snag an endorsement deal with the Adidas ADDYY brand but the company didn’t make any offers. Nor did Converse which already had deals with Larry Bird Magic Johnson and Julius Erving.

Nike NKE was not Jordan’s preferred choice for a corporate benefactor and an initial meeting at the company’s headquarters in Beaverton Oregon left him underwhelmed. But the company’s $500000 five-year contract changed his mind.

The rest as is often said is history – the Air Jordan sneaker brand from Nike generated $126 million in sales in its first 12 months the market. In Q2 FY2019 the brand recorded more than $1 billion in sales a first for sports footwear. The 2020 documentary series “The Last Dance” put Jordan back in the spotlight and reanimated sales of the sneaker. In Nike’s case Jordan was the gift that keeps on giving.

Elizabeth Taylor for Elizabeth Arden: In 1991 Elizabeth Arden announced a deal with movie star Elizabeth Taylor on a new perfume called White Diamonds. The product was not marketed as a run-of-the-mill scent – the company first sold White Diamonds at $200 an ounce in an exclusive launch at New York’s Marshall Field & Co department store and the first 150 customers who purchased a $300-an-ounce limited edition version were treated to a private tea party with the one-time big-screen Cleopatra.

There were perfumes tied to celebrities before White Diamonds hit the market. But as the blog Fashionista observed about Taylor’s star power: “While she certainly wasn't the first celebrity to come out with a scent she was the first to do it well.”

The success of White Diamonds stirred a whirlpool within the cosmetics industry and companies began paying considerable sums to sign various actors singers and athletes to put their name and image on bottles of perfume and cologne. Still Taylor’s celebrity influence reigned the strongest – when she died in 2011 20 years after the product debuted its global sales were $61.3 million a top-seller for Elizabeth Arden.

Elizabeth Arden was acquired in 2016 by Revlon Inc. REV but the new owners were not eager to jettison the brand. Today White Diamonds is still bringing in revenue for Revlon and Elizabeth Taylor’s name remains prominently displayed on the packaging.

It would seem that some stars never fade away.

Date: May 15 2021

By Mark Finlay Simple Flying

Launched in the corner of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in an abandoned terminal in 1981 People Express was the brainchild of former Texas International Airlines CEO Don Burr. Inspired by Britains Freddie Laker and his low-cost Skytrain flights People Express offered fares lower than its competitors.



It was able to do this by making its employees owners of the airline. This meant that no matter what your title was you would help out where ever necessary. Pilots would help load luggage while sales personnel would help out at the check-in counters. This allowed People Express to have one of the highest employee productivity rates in the industry.



People Express used Boeing 737s

Operating using a Boeing 737-100 People Express first flew from Newark to Buffalo New York before adding flights to Columbus and Cleveland Ohio Norfolk Virginia and Jacksonville Florida. By December of 1981 People Express had 42-weekday departures to destinations up and down the east coast and midwest.

Unbundling the various components of air travel People Express allowed passengers to pay for what they wanted and more importantly not pay for what they did not want. One carry-on item was free but if you wanted a checked bag it would cost you $3. Likewise the food and drinks that other airlines included in their fares were add-on items with People Express who charged a dollar for a beer and 50 cents for a can of soda.

People Express gambled that passengers without baggage and those who were not so keen on airline food would be prepared to fly People Express to save big on the airfare. For the first three years in business it looked like Burr and the others who set up the airline were right. For once following the deregulation of the industry People Express was letting the marketplace dictate the policies and prices. Not only was People Express offering low-cost tickets but it was also forcing other airlines to cut their ticket prices as well.

People Express took on the big three

Despite its initial success by flying routes with little or no competition in the United States People Express got too big for its own boots and decided to take on the bigger established airlines. Soon the low-cost carrier was offering flights to Chicago and Dallas despite United Airlines and American Airlines regarding the two cities as belonging to them. When People Express began offering flights to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) Delta Air Lines was not too pleased.

In 1983 People Express much in the same way as Freddie Laker had done became a household name in air travel when it introduced $149 one-way flights from Newark Liberty to London Gatwick (LGA) on May 26 1983. Using a leased former Braniff International Airways Boeing 747-227B People Express flights to London were an instant hit with flights almost always fully booked.

Now on everyone’s radar and having annoyed the big three carriers in the United States People Express began to learn what it was like to play in the big league. The first lesson for People Express was that American Airlines United Airlines and Delta Air Lines do not surrender their home turf easily.



When you take on the big three you are no longer competing solely on price as they will match your fares dollar for dollar no matter how low you go. You will also find yourself competing with their automated booking systems and codeshare agreements with other airlines. Lastly and perhaps more importantly you are competing with their frequent flyer programs.



People Express bought Frontier Airlines

Now fully on the radar and knowing what they were up against most people expected People Express to back off and concentrate on secondary markets that American Delta and United were not interested in. Instead of this People Express did the opposite purchasing Denver-based Frontier Airlines for $300 million in 1985.

At the time Frontier was on its last legs following a bitter fare war with United Airlines and Continental Airlines that Frontier was losing. The move by People Express had analysts wondering had People Express made a brilliant business move or a massive blunder.

Buying Frontier Airlines not only burdened People Express with debt it did not need but it also alienated Frontier Airlines passengers with its no-frills approach and caused labor struggles with Frontier Airlines employees. With its heavy debt load People Express decided to change its philosophy and lure lucrative business travelers. Cabins were redesigned to include a first class section and a frequent flyer program was introduced as People Express looked to copy mainstream carriers.



In the end massive debt proved to be the downfall of People Express with the airline forced to work with an investment bank as it looked for a buyer and a way out of trouble. People Express was bought by Texas Air Corporation and merged into Continental Airlines in February 1987. Headed by Frank Lorenzo Texas Air Corporation paid around $125 million in cash notes and assumed all People Express debt.



According to the aviation enthusiast website Planespotters.net People Express operated a fleet of 17 Boeing 737-100s five Boeing 737-200s and ten Boeing 747 aircraft during its brief six-year life span.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYW1leC1idXNpbmVzcy1wbGF0aW51bS0xNTBrLW9mZmVyLXdpdGgtbm8tbGlmZXRpbWUtbGFuZ3VhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(EXPIRED) (Targeted) Amex Business Platinum 150k Offer With No Lifetime Language,"Sorry this deal is no longer available.

American Express is targeting some existing Business Platinum cardholders with a great offer for opening an additional Business Platinum card which has no lifetime language.

The Deal

Targeted Amex Business Platinum cardholders can earn 150000 Membership Rewards points when opening a new Business Platinum card and spending $15000 in the first three months of card membership.

Key Terms

Application required by December 31 2021.

Quick Thoughts

If you’re targeted for this offer and can manage the $15000 minimum spend requirement within three months this offer will be a no-brainer for most. It works out to be at least 11 Membership Rewards points per dollar on the first $15000 of spend when taking into account the minimum 1x you’ll earn automatically on that spend.

That’s a fantastic return especially seeing as this offer has no lifetime language:

It’s also notable that this offer is valid for applications through December 31 2021. Provided Amex doesn’t modify or revoke the offer before then (as the subsequent terms state they can) it could be useful being able to delay applying for the card until later this year. That way you could apply to either take advantage of increased spending over the holidays and/or for tax payments at the end of the year or early in 2022. Applying at the end of the year also means you can triple dip the $200 per year in airline fee credits and quadruple dip the $100 twice-annual Dell credits.

This offer showed up when logging into an Amex account but keep an eye on your inbox in case they send you an email with this offer too. My wife was targeted for a 100000 Membership Rewards offer for adding a Business Platinum card a couple of months after getting her first Business Platinum card. That offer didn’t have any lifetime language either although she has to apply by June 30 2021 to take advantage of that particular offer so be sure to check the terms if you’re targeted for an offer like one of these.

Also be sure to look for the lifetime language in the offer wording and print or screenshot it for your records just in case. The email my wife received from Amex stated (my bolding):

Welcome offer not available to applicants who have or have had this Card. We may also consider the number of American Express Cards you have opened and closed as well as other factors in making a decision on your welcome offer eligibility.

However when clicking through to the application page and looking at the terms there that lifetime language was nowhere to be seen.

The 150k offer only seems to be showing up when logging into your Amex account rather than being sent out via email like the 100k offer but keep an eye out for lifetime language anyway.

If you’ve never had a Business Platinum card before and get targeted for one of these offers you might be able to do even better if you have a Player 2. Referral links to the Business Platinum card sometimes display the 150k offer (especially when testing out different browser options) so using that referral link would get you the same 150k welcome bonus but it’d also earn your P2 bonus points. This no lifetime language offer is more notable for people who’ve either had the card before or who still have one because that normally precludes you from getting another welcome bonus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9oaWx0b24taGVhZC1pc2xhbmQtZXZlcnktdHlwZS10cmF2ZWxlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Hilton Head is a perfect vacation for any traveler,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

This island has a fascinating history. For more than 300 years the Gullah ancient culture continues to remain a vibrant thread in the fabric of Hilton Head Island life. Their influence on the area can still be seen today in the Gullah language (a creole similar to Sierra Leone Krio) African names their African folktales and craft items. Much of the Lowcountry's beloved food culture also originated with the Gullah — rice purlo okra gumbo shrimp and gravy cooked with spices and time-honored African cooking methods.

Historic Mitchelville located on Hilton Head's Port Royal Sound was America's first self-governed town of freed slaves. Established in 1862 by General Ormsby Mitchel the commander of the Union forces that occupied Hilton Head Island the town was built by and for those granted their freedom before the Emancipation Proclamation in the Port Royal Experiment. Gullah people direct descendants of Mitchelville continue to tell their story through the Mitchelville Freedom Park and the Mitchelville Preservation Project.

Now they're being used as an excuse for China's crackdown in Xinjiang,"Hong Kong CNN —

The men crouched inside the cave their faces streaked with dust occasionally flinching involuntarily at the explosions overhead which seemed to shake the entire mountain.

Outside was a vision of hell.

Vast plumes of smoke and debris were thrown up into the air as US B-52 bombers and fighter jets let loose a seemingly endless barrage of missiles. The noise from the bombardment could be heard from miles away a deep hollow booming sound as each bomb struck.

It was December 2001 and the target of the strikes was Osama bin Laden orchestrator of the attacks on New York and Washington three months earlier. He was believed to be hiding out along with a core of al Qaeda fighters in Tora Bora a cave complex south of the city of Jalalabad in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Whether Bin Laden was there at all remains disputed but if he was he managed to slip away along with several other top al Qaeda leaders avoiding both the aerial bombardment and US and Afghan troops on the ground. He would dodge US forces for another decade before being tracked to a suburb of the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where he was killed in 2011.

After two months of moving from cave to cave steadily running out of food their nerves fried by the constant bombings and fear of running into Northern Alliance troops combing the area for any suspected Taliban fighters the men in the cave also made it to Pakistan.

They were Uyghurs a Turkic-speaking predominantly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang a region in far-western China also referred to by some as “East Turkestan.” While today the group is well known due to international condemnation of China’s crackdown in Xinjiang – which politicians in the United States Canada and the Netherlands have described as a “genocide” – in the early 2000s few Americans had ever heard or even knew how to pronounce the word Uyghur.

This began to change when it was revealed that almost two dozen Uyghurs were being held without trial in an offshore detention center in Guantanamo Bay accused of being “enemy combatants” in Washington’s war on terror. Around the same time the US also controversially added an alleged Uyghur militant organization the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) to a State Department list of terrorist groups.

After years of court battles and campaigns by their families and human rights groups the 22 Uyghurs held at Guantanamo were all eventually declared “non-combatants” and gradually released with the last three men finally leaving the detention camp in 2013.

None of them were permitted to settle in the US however nor could they safely return to Xinjiang. Instead they ended up in a kind of legal limbo in the countries that agreed to accept them mostly small European and Central American nations that are close to Washington.

From there the former detainees have watched as the situation in their homeland one that many of them intentionally fled decades ago has only gotten worse. Many have lost contact with their families some of whom are believed to have ended up in the sprawling detention camp system set up in Xinjiang which Beijing claims is vital for “deradicalization” and “vocational training.”

The Guantanamo Uyghurs have also had to watch as China’s propaganda organs have deployed their own existence and claims made by Washington about ETIM during the “war on terror” as the justification for Beijing’s own ongoing crackdown.

After the last detainees were released in late 2013 a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman denounced the move saying “they are terrorists without any doubt.”

“These suspects are members of the ‘East Turkistan Islamic Movement’ a terrorist organization designated by the UN Security Council” spokesman Qin Gang said. “They will not only pose severe threat to China’s national security but also to that of the recipient country.”

Since then China’s propaganda around ETIM has only ramped up with state media denouncing the group as the “black hand” behind almost all acts of violence in Xinjiang in “for decades”

“Even though America declared we were innocent that we hadn’t done anything China continues to say we worked with the Taliban and al Qaeda” said Abu Bakeer Qassim a former Guantanamo detainee now living in Albania. “They say Uyghurs are terrorists with links to al Qaeda Taliban and ISIS. This propaganda has been really successful.”

In recent weeks US President Joe Biden has renewed his commitment to end America’s longest war promising to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in time for the twentieth anniversary of 9/11 this year. But for the Uyghurs the war on terror will continue with its rhetoric having been adopted by Beijing to justify a new round of repression under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Caught by war

As he fled US bombs across the mountains into Pakistan Ahmet Adil was retracing his steps.

He says he had never intended to go to Afghanistan but like many of the other Guantanamo Uyghurs – as they would recount in interviews with CNN and during tribunal testimony at the detention camp – ended up there from a lack of safe alternatives.

“The reason I left home first was that our family was going through economic hardship” Adil said in an interview speaking via an interpreter. “I decided to go to Central Asia and make money to provide for my family.”

One of the poorer regions of China Xinjiang was largely controlled by what’s known as Bingtuan a state-run paramilitary corps and Uyghurs often found life there stifling with opportunities few and far between and growing restrictions on religious and cultural practices.

Initially Adil crossed into Kazakhstan which neighbors Xinjiang to the north and has long been home to a large Uyghur population both Kazakh citizens and economic migrants. Adil stayed there for about a year finding some work and sending money home but while there were less restrictions than in China it wasn’t easy and Adil said he “gradually came to a decision to attempt to leave for Europe for even freer life.”

He began looking for a way to reach Turkey home to the world’s largest Uyghur diaspora. But with funds short making the over 3800 kilometer (2400 mile) journey from Almaty to Istanbul was going to be difficult.

From Kazakhstan he traveled to Pakistan again staying for almost a year as he searched for work and ways to continue westward. There was only one country between him and Turkey Iran but Adil says he could not get a visa nor could he afford to fly. Returning to Xinjiang was no longer an option he had heard of people being jailed or integrated after they had been abroad for some time particularly in Muslim countries. China viewed Uyghurs who left the country with deep suspicion especially if there was any suggestion they might have been radicalized.

For Adil the situation was growing untenable: the authorities in Pakistan were known to be rounding Uyghurs up and sending them back to China.

Then he met a man who suggested he go to Afghanistan where he knew of a Uyghur community living near Jalalabad who could provide him shelter and paid work while he continued to save to go west.

Many other Uyghurs who would end up in Guantanamo provide similar accounts. Like Adil Abu Bakeer Qassim said he left China to work in Central Asia until it got too dangerous traveling first to Pakistan from where he hoped to go to Turkey.

“We had Pakistani friends. They said go to Afghanistan there is a Uyghur village there. You can learn your religion a bit more and then go to Turkey” he said in an interview with CNN from Albania. “We went to Jalalabad and then up a mountain road I later found out this was near Tora Bora.”

Another future detainee Mohammed Ayoub said he had been in Pakistan hoping to travel to the US but was “aware at the time that the Pakistan government was increasingly rounding up Uyghurs to turn them over to the Chinese.”

Ayoub and another man traveled across the border to Jalalabad where they were until the US invasion started when they fled into the nearby mountains and eventually met up with “a group of five to six Uyghurs who also wanted to escape.”

Camp in the mountains

While it may seem in retrospect the worst possible place to be Afghanistan in the late 1990s and early 2000s did present something of a refuge for those exiles in Central and East Asia with few other places to go.

The country was ruled by the Taliban a hardline Islamist movement which had seized control in 1996 at the culmination of a multi-year civil war which followed the Soviet Union’s withdrawal in 1989.

Only officially recognized by three countries – Pakistan Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – the Taliban never controlled all of the country and much of the border area with Pakistan in particular remained mostly lawless.

This was where mujahideen fighters funded by the US and a host of Muslim countries to fight the USSR had gathered in the 1980s to train and launch attacks against the Communist Afghan government and its invading Soviet allies.

In the late 1990s one group who allegedly took advantage of this lawless environment was a small community of Uyghur nationalists who set up a training camp in the mountains south of Jalalabad with a view to initiating an insurgency inside China “a goal (they) never came close to attaining” according to Sean Roberts author of “The War on the Uyghurs: China’s Internal Campaign Against a Muslim Minority.”

This settlement would later be compared – by both US and Chinese officials – to those run by al Qaeda with files kept on the detainees at Guantanamo describing it as “a training camp in the Tora Bora Mountains that had been given to the (Uyghurs) by the Taliban.”

Roberts who has researched the topic extensively and interviewed many of the men who passed through the camp said this is a vast exaggeration.

While a handful of the Uyghurs there were militant and might have dreamed of some future revolution in China most were like Adil he said economic migrants cut loose by a lack of visas or safe paths to travel hoping to find a way to go west.

“In the 1990s there was a lot of pressure on Uyghurs from the Chinese government focused on concern around ‘separatism’” Roberts said in an interview. “A lot of people wanted to find ways to live outside China and initially there was a pretty stable route into Central Asia as well as a slightly less stable one into Pakistan.”

In the past Uyghurs who pursued these routes could often stay indefinitely sending money back home and living largely under the radar but this started to change as China put pressure on its neighbors to kick them out in the late 1990s worried about potential separatist movements growing next to its borders Roberts said.

The small community which evolved in the mountains of Afghanistan was “not really an organization as a vision that had not been realized” Roberts said.

Adil said that when he arrived he found what was essentially a shanty town. He helped fix the place up repairing houses pumping water and clearing rocks. One day he took a turn with an AK-47 one of a handful of guns in the camp owned by the more militant residents who spoke of needing to learn how to shoot in the event of a future revolution in the Uyghur homeland.

While this would later be used by Guantanamo interrogators as evidence to claim Adil was part of a terror group multiple detainees said there was no real organization to speak of just a few bored men with a gun and wild dreams they had little chance of realizing.

Qassim said that he too was trained with an AK-47 but this was at least in part for security given ongoing fighting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance.

“Afghanistan was at war and every day we would have to stand guard” he said. “You can’t stand guard without a weapon.”

In interviews and in records of interrogations at Guantanamo all the Uyghur detainees said there was little if any connection between the camp and the Taliban or other Afghans – those locals they did meet they largely struggled to communicate with due to a lack of a shared language.

What religious practice did occur was limited to daily prayers and studying the Quran which many of the Uyghurs enjoyed because they had been denied the opportunity growing up in China where restrictions on Muslim worship ramped up considerably in the 1990s. The form of Islam being practiced in the Uyghur camp was mostly the Sufism popular in Xinjiang rather than the far more austere strict version of the religion advanced by the Taliban.

Captured and shipped off

Cut off from the rest of Afghanistan let alone the wider world few of the men in the Uyghur camp had any idea what happened in September 2001 until the bombing campaigns started weeks later.

Taliban and al Qaeda forces had fled into the mountains where they were staging a rearguard action against Northern Alliance and American special forces harried all the time by US air power.

The Uyghurs ran too into the caves that crisscross the mountains and make them such a defensive location. There they sheltered unsure of what to do terrified of being killed by the bombs or shot by the invaders. Even if they were detained and survived they feared they would be handed over to China.

“We got stuck in the mountains. The planes were all over the place” Qassim said. “An old man told us to go to Pakistan you’ll freeze here – the man said we don’t have any food either we couldn’t get food for one week.”

After days of walking the group of around 18 Uyghurs made it into Pakistan and found a village where locals sheltered and fed them. But the hospitality was a charade: Pakistani soldiers surrounded the village and detained the Uyghurs who later found out they had been sold for $5000 bounties a-piece according to US government documents.

“They sold us” Qassim said. “They said ‘we caught them’ we didn’t know anything. They blindfolded us and took us to (a) base. We stayed there for a month.”

They didn’t tell the Pakistanis that they were Uyghurs for fear of being sent back to China Qassim said. They gave false names – ones which sounded Arabic rather than Uyghur and would stick to them at Guantanamo – and claimed to be Afghan Uzbeks.

“We thought it would be bad to go back to China for our relatives or friends it would be bad for everyone” he added. “They said they would give us to America. We said that’s better. China is worse.”

After about six months Qassim said the men were put on a plane and flown to Camp X-Ray the newly established military prison at Guantanamo Bay.

Set up in the wake of the 9/11 attacks as a place for interrogating and detaining terrorism suspects Guantanamo Bay soon became an international symbol of US rights abuses during the so-called “war on terror.”

Detainees were held without charge and subjected to widespread abuse including torture with Washington claiming that the prison located on a US Naval Base in southern Cuba was not covered by the constitution an argument the Supreme Court rejected in 2004. Following that ruling multiple prisoners including many of the Uyghurs filed habeas corpus cases forcing the US government to present the evidence it had against them a move that often resulted in their eventual release.

Former US President Barack Obama promised and failed to close the Guantanamo prison where about 40 detainees are still housed – although that’s down from the high hundreds it housed at the height of the Global War on Terror. Earlier this year the Biden administration made the same pledge to shut down the facility.

“Considering the violence that has happened at Guantanamo we are sure that after more than nineteen years you agree that imprisoning people indefinitely without trial while subjecting them to torture cruelty and degrading treatment with no meaningful access to families or proper legal systems is the height of injustice” seven former detainees wrote in a letter to Biden in January. “That is why imprisonment at Guantanamo must end.”

Two former Uyghur detainees approached for this article declined to be interviewed through their lawyer citing a desire not to relive the trauma they suffered at Guantanamo.

A shadowy organization

Arriving at Guantanamo blindfolded and shackled the Uyghur detainees discovered they were being classed as “enemy combatants” members of a group tied to both the Taliban and al Qaeda a group most had never even heard of: the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).

Official documents from Guantanamo published by Wikileaks described ETIM as a Uyghur “separatist organization dedicated to the creation of … (an) Islamic homeland in China through armed insurrection and terrorism.” They claimed that it had unified with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan “to form a larger and more capable terrorist organization which is now directly affiliated and supported” by al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.

Chinese officials go even further blaming ETIM for almost every terror attack or violent incident in Xinjiang and other parts of the country since the mid-1990s through to today.

In November 2020 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the group “has long been engaging in terrorist and violent activities causing heavy casualties and property losses and posing serious threats to security and stability in China the region and beyond.”

A video released by state broadcaster CGTN the previous year compared the group to al Qaeda and ISIS saying it “has attempted to recruit people on a massive scale spreading a radical ideology that continues to cause chaos in many countries around the world.” While Chinese authorities boast of having defeated terrorism in Xinjiang they argue that ETIM presents an ongoing threat one that justifies the crackdown on Uyghurs and Islam generally.

The problem say most experts is that there is little independent evidence to confirm China’s claims of ETIM’s size and influence. While there was an uptick in violence in Xinjiang in the 1990s and 2000s and some small radical Uyghur groups were known to be based in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area Roberts said the picture Beijing advances of a cohesive organized international movement directing terror attacks inside in China is very misleading.

“My understanding is that there was not really any organized militant resistance instead there were these isolated incidents (in Xinjiang)” he said. “What happened after 9/11 was that the Chinese government tried to reframe all those incidents as being related to Islamic terrorism and overtly saying they were funded by Osama bin Laden.”

Many of the events now blamed on ETIM by Chinese authorities such as ethnic unrest in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in 2009 were covered by the international media at the time and had no links to terrorism and clear alternative motivations. While groups overseas have claimed credit for some incidents inside China little evidence has been given and Roberts said this is akin to ISIS falsely claiming lone-wolf attacks in the US and elsewhere.

The picture is further confused due to the reason that Chinese state media initially suppressed coverage or ignored other incidents in Xinjiang now used to make the argument that the region was a hotbed of terrorism ahead of the recent crackdowns.

One thing is clear however beginning in 2002 Beijing’s narrative shifted from concern about nationalist separatists to painting all Uyghur dissidents as Islamist terrorists. This transformation appears to have been inspired partly by and received a major boost from what today seems like an unlikely source: Washington.

In August of that year the George W. Bush administration designated ETIM as a Foreign Terrorist Organization a move that was quickly followed by United Nations sanctions sponsored by the US China Kyrgyzstan and the new US-sponsored administration in Kabul.

At the time the group was “virtually unknown among experts in the region” Roberts said and yet the US actually went further than China blaming ETIM for almost every violent incident in Xinjiang from the 1990s in a preemption of the current propaganda line.

Speaking at a congressional hearing years later Randall Schriver who was deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the State Department at the time of ETIM’s designation defended the designation of ETIM as a terrorist organization saying that the Bush administration came under pressure from Beijing to list multiple groups and ETIM was the only one where there was any convincing evidence.

Other experts both at the time and since have expressed skepticism however particularly over the idea that ETIM could have been directing terror attacks in China while under the nominal protection of the Taliban given that Beijing had relatively good ties with Kabul at the time.

Schriver acknowledged too that while the Uyghur community “is not immune to this uglier side of nationalism” militants are “a very small minority within a minority.”

In comparing Chinese propaganda and the Bush administration statements Congressman Bill Delahunt who chaired the hearing said it “appears to me that we took substantial intelligence information from the Chinese Communist regime and then used that questionable evidence as our own as a significant factor in the determination that ETIM was a terrorist organization.”

His colleague Dana Rohrabacher accused the government of designating ETIM “to appease the Chinese Government in a pathetic attempt to gain its support at the beginning of the war against Iraq.”

In response to a request for comment for this article a US State Department spokeswoman said Washington had revoked ETIM’s designation as a terrorist group in November 2020.

“ETIM was removed from the list because for more than a decade there has been no credible evidence that ETIM continues to exist” the spokeswoman said. “We assess that ETIM is now a broad label China uses to inaccurately paint a variety of (Uyghur) actors including non-violent activists and advocates for human rights as terrorist threats. China often labels individuals and groups as terrorists on the basis of their political and religious beliefs even if they do not advocate violence.”

Cooperation with the Chinese on anti-terrorism was a rare bright spot in the Bush administration’s efforts to build stronger ties with Beijing which were marred early on in his term by the mid-air collision of Chinese and US military planes over the island of Hainan.

Standing alongside then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin in Beijing in 2002 Bush welcomed “China’s cooperation in our war against terror.”

Collaboration between the US and China in the 2000s went beyond designating ETIM. Two years into their detainment Chinese Communist Party interrogators were given access to the Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo interviews which terrified the men who feared their families could face repercussions or that they would be handed over to authorities in Beijing.

“During the interrogation I didn’t answer any questions” Adil said. “They threatened me by saying ‘when we bring you back to China you will get what you deserve and will answer our questions’.”

Ayoub told CNN that “some of us talked some of us didn’t.”

“But we were all worried that if the Chinese officials could come here and question us that they could also take us” he said. “I was in questioning for three hours but I didn’t talk. I didn’t say a word.”

He added that the officials “threatened me and my family” while Qassim said “we got really afraid when the Chinese came.”

“They asked me ‘where are you from?’ I said from East Turkistan – they said ‘no such place.’ I said yes there is” Qassim said.

When the call to prayer was played over the camp speakers Qassim said his Chinese interrogator was surprised assuming the Americans would not allow such overtly Muslim practice.

“I told him we pray and get to fast here” Qassim said. “They make mistakes but they don’t trample on our religion. We have the Quran prayer fasting. That was the good part (of Guantanamo).”

Speaking at the 2009 hearing Shriver the former State Department official said it was “absolutely inappropriate and unacceptable” to have allowed Chinese Communist Party security officers to interview the Uyghur detainees.

China continues to view ETIM as a dangerous terrorist organization. Speaking in November after the US delisted the group Wang Wenbin Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said ETIM “has long been engaging in terrorist and violent activities causing heavy casualties and property losses and posing serious threats to security and stability in China the region and beyond.”

Release into limbo

When they arrived at Guantanamo all 22 Uyghur detainees were designated “enemy combatants” and told to many of their surprise that they were believed to be members of ETIM and linked to al Qaeda.

Throughout the next decade the Pentagon gradually reversed this decision and would eventually categorize them all as “no longer enemy combatants.”

The problem was then what to do with them. While Bush administration officials had said relatively early that the men would never be sent to China for fear they could be tortured or executed neither were they willing to resettle any former Guantanamo detainees in the US.

“We requested the US government to find a home for them one where they would not later end up in China under diplomatic pressure” said Nury Turkel a lawyer who worked on behalf of the Uyghur detainees.

After years of campaigning by the detainees themselves their lawyers and human rights groups the first batch of five detainees including Adil Ayoub and Qassim were transferred to Albania.

With the election of Obama who had promised to close the Guantanamo Bay camp Turkel said there was a lot of optimism that the remaining Uyghurs would be released quickly and might even be resettled in the US.

But these hopes faded as Congressional Republicans introduced the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act in an attempt to block the Obama administration moving Guantanamo detainees to the mainland and rallied media pressure against the White House. This made it more difficult to negotiate with other countries too said Turkel because they expressed skepticism at taking men the US had apparently deemed too dangerous to resettle itself.

There was also pressure from Beijing: cables published by WikiLeaks in 2010 showed that at one point Germany was considering accepting seven Uyghurs but was “subsequently warned by China of ‘a heavy burden on bilateral relations’” between Berlin and Beijing should they do so.

Eventually homes were found for all 22 of the Guantanamo Uyghurs with the last men leaving the detention camp in 2013 for Slovakia after years of negotiations between Washington and various allies including Albania over who would be willing to take the former detainees.

Release has not meant a return to normality however. Adil said that life in Albania is itself a kind of detention and his freedoms are still highly limited.

“We’ve been living in Albania for 15 years with severe restrictions” he said. “Our life here can be likened to being in an open-air prison. All we have is a piece of residence permit and we can’t even access such simple services as buying a SIM card because of the lack of legal documents.”

Qassim said that the men had been promised passports but this has never happened.

Albania’s Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.

“It’s like we are prisoners again” he said. “We didn’t just come here so we could die. I want to be able to live. I want to be able to send my kids to school abroad and visit them. They ask me – they say people go to Turkey let’s go visit but we can’t.”

Attempts by some of the Uyghurs to leave the places where they resettled have so far been unsuccessful. Ayoub is part of a lawsuit three former Guantanamo detainees have brought against the Canadian government trying to force Ottawa to allow them to travel to that country.

“We don’t have permission to work here (in Albania)” Ayoub said. “We’re unable to get passports we’re not allowed to travel outside of Albania. We’ve been here for over 15 years.”

All three plaintiffs are married to Canadian citizens but the authorities have refused to allow them to join them in Canada arguing they are “inadmissible on security grounds” due to their alleged membership of a terrorist organisation: ETIM.

“The evidence that the Canadian government is relying on all emerged from their detention in Guantanamo” said Prasanna Balasundaram the lead lawyer on the case. “There is no credible evidence that Ayoub was ever a member of ETIM.”

He pointed to the apparent hypocrisy of Canada whose parliament recently accused China of committing “genocide” in Xinjiang of relying on the same evidence as Beijing in order to deny the entry of his clients.

“The problem is that for them to be deemed inadmissible on security grounds the bar is quite low below even the civil standard of proof” Balasundaram said adding he hoped increased attention to the general plight of the Uyghurs will pressure Ottawa to change its decision regarding his clients.

Global Affairs Canada the country’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment about Ayoub’s case.

“There is this large misunderstanding (dating) from when we were caught up” Ayoub said. “We were essentially victimized by politics. We were caught up in the politics between these nations.”

The US government has also retreated from its previous statements about ETIM saying in a report in 2019 that there was a “lack of independent evidence that a group by that name is still active.” This culminated last year in the Donald Trump administration de-listing ETIM entirely much to Beijing’s fury with Chinese officials denouncing the move as a political one.

Ayoub said that when there was an attempt to resettle the Guantanamo Uyghurs it was clear that many countries refused to take them because they were afraid of harming their economic relations with China something he saw repeated in how numerous governments react to the current situation.

“Even most Muslim-majority countries are choosing to side with China” he said. “The international community needs to stand together to put human rights above their economic interests. Standing on the sidelines to oppression only aids oppression so everyone has a responsibility to stand up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMDgvd29ybGQvYXNpYS9ib21iaW5nLXNjaG9vbC1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bombing Outside Afghan School Kills at Least 90 With Girls as Targets (Published 2021),"KABUL Afghanistan — Powerful explosions outside a high school in Afghanistan’s capital on Saturday killed at least 90 people and wounded scores more many of them teenage girls leaving class in a gruesome attack that underscored fears about the nation’s future after the impending American troop withdrawal.

Youmna al-Sayed had less than an hour to get to safety.

But with just one elevator working in al-Jalaa tower an 11-storey building in Gaza City housing some 60 residential apartments and a number of offices including those of Al Jazeera Media Network and The Associated Press al-Sayed made a dash for the stairs.

“We left the elevator for the elderly and for the children to evacuate” the Palestinian freelance journalist said. “And we were all running down the stairs and whoever could help children took them down” she added. “I myself helped two children of the residents there and I took them downstairs – everyone was just running quickly.”

Moments earlier the Israeli army which has been bombarding Gaza for six straight days had given a telephone warning that residents had just an hour to evacuate the building before its fighter jets attacked it.

Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout also had to move quickly. He and his colleagues “started to collect as much as they could from the personal and equipment of the office – especially the cameras” al-Kahlout said.

But more time was needed.

“Just give me 15 minutes” an AP journalist pleaded over the phone with an Israeli intelligence officer. “We have a lot of equipment including the cameras other things” he added from outside the building. “I can bring all of it out.”

Jawad Mahdi the building’s owner also tried to buy more time.

“All I’m asking is to let four people … to go inside and get their cameras” he told the officer. “We respect your wishes we will not do it if you don’t allow it but give us 10 minutes.”

“There will be no 10 minutes” the officer replied. “No one is allowed to enter the building we already gave you an hour to evacuate.”

When the request was rejected Mahdi said: “You have destroyed our life’s work memories life. I will hang up do what you want. There is a God.”

The Israeli army claimed there were “military interests of the Hamas intelligence” in the building a standard line used after bombing buildings in Gaza and it accused the group running the territory of using journalists as human shields. However it provided no evidence to back up its claims.

“I have been working in this office for more than 10 years and I have never seen anything [suspicious]” al-Kahlout said.

AP VIDEO: Associated Press staff evacuated their office in Gaza City shortly before the building was destroyed in an Israel airstrike. https://t.co/Ib5T2SohXq — The Associated Press (@AP) May 15 2021

“I even asked my colleagues if they’ve seen anything suspicious and they all confirmed to me that they have never seen any military aspects or the fighters even coming in and out” he added.

“In our building we have lots of families that we know for more than 10 years we meet each other every day on our way in and out to the office.”

Gary Pruitt president and CEO of AP also told Al Jazeera: “I can tell you that we’ve been in that building for about 15 years for our bureau. We certainly had no sense that Hamas was there.”

Al-Sayed who has been covering Israel’s bombardment for Al Jazeera and has worked for AP said she could not understand what threat a building housing families and offices for lawyers doctors and media workers could pose.

“Where is the alarm from this? Where are the Hamas or any military members that could be in this building?” the Gaza resident asked.

“The people here the residents all know each other. The first five floors are for offices that are [closed] during this time of escalation. So basically what is [still here] are the two media offices of Al Jazeera and AP and the residential apartments.”

Still at 3:12pm (12:12 GMT) the first Israeli strike came. Five minutes later al-Jalaa tower crashed to the ground after being hit by three missiles that sent a dark cloud of dust and debris into the air. There have been no immediate reports of casualties.

“Years of memories years of work in this building suddenly everything is rubble” said al-Kahlout about the tower from whose roof he often broadcast from. “Just vanished.”

Islam az-Zaeem a lawyer who worked in the building was at home when his cousin – the owner of the Johara building that was flattened overnight on May 13 – knocked on his door and told him al-Jalaa was about to be destroyed.

“I ran to the building and saw the residents and other employees gathered outside” az-Zaeem told Al Jazeera.

“I went inside and took the stairs since the electricity was out and the elevators weren’t working. I was hysterical and fell down several times in the dark shouting and crying.”

Az-Zaeem who said nine legal associates and four interns worked on his floor left the building five minutes before it was levelled.

“Even after the building fell I kept shouting that I’d forgotten to lock the door to my office” he said. “Imagine that.”

AP journalist Fares Akram said he had been sleeping in the office after a long night of reporting when his colleagues began shouting “Evacuation! Evacuation!” Akram grabbed what he could – a laptop some electronics and a few things from his desk – before running down the stairs and jumping into his car he wrote in a written piece after the attack.

When he was far enough away Akram stopped the car and got out to look back at the tower. He said he witnessed drone strikes hit the building followed by three more powerful strikes from F-16s.

“At first it looked like layers of something collapsing. I thought of a bowl of potato chips and what might happen if you slammed a fist into them. Then the smoke and dust enveloped everything. The sky rumbled. And the building that was home to some people an office to others and both to me disappeared in a shroud of dust” Akram wrote.

The building built in the mid-1990s was one of Gaza City’s oldest high-rises.

Fares al-Ghoul the executive director for the Mayadeen Media Group said his company was previously based in the Shorouq building which was destroyed by Israeli missiles on May 13.

“The upper floors of Shorouq were targeted in the 2014 war” he said. “In 2019 we moved the company to al-Jalaa building because we thought it would be safer since it accommodated the offices of international media agencies.”

“Now both have been destroyed” he said.

‘No place is safe in Gaza’

The bombing of al-Jalaa widely condemned as an attempt to “silence” journalists covering Israel’s offensive came just hours after an Israeli air raid at Shati refugee camp killed 10 members of the same family – eight children two women – celebrating Eid al-Fitr the religious festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

At least 174 Palestinians including 47 children have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israeli air raids on the coastal Palestinian territory began on Monday. About 950 others have been wounded.

The violence comes after Israel’s plan to forcibly displace Palestinian families from occupied East Jerusalem and its attacks on Palestinian worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound spurred widespread protests in Jerusalem the occupied West Bank and inside Israel. Hamas said it began firing rockets towards Israel in response to that Israeli crackdown. At least nine people have also been killed in Israel.

As evening fell on Gaza families and journalists started returning to al-Jalaa in the hopes of salvaging some of their belongings buried underneath the rubble.

“One person came back to look for some paintings done by his daughter because these paintings carried a lot of memories” said al-Kahlout who continued reporting from the streets of the bombarded enclave. “We moved outside and are now applying our emergency plans for reporting. We are trying to be safe. No place is safe in Gaza but we are trying to do our best.”

Al-Sayed meanwhile headed to al-Shifa Hospital believed to be a safe space to broadcast from. “It’s devastating” she said of the al-Jalaa building’s flattening.

“I worked in that place and my heart was broken to see it being brought to the ground it was tragic. Every place whether we work or we live we have incredible memories” she added.

“What about those families who have lost their homes who have lost everything they saved to get these apartments? In Gaza it’s not an easy thing to be able to get an apartment and now in just minutes [they] lose everything.

“Words can’t describe the amount of devastation can’t describe the tragedy that people are going through.”

The tower stands just over a block away from Rittenhouse Square Park and several blocks to the south of the Liberty Place complex. Designed by McIlvain and Roberts a firm that had also designed the American Patriots Building and 3557 Walnut Street the building rises 364 feet and 33 stories tall. The tower is clad in brick and limestone and makes a distinctive presence on the skyline oarticularly when viewed from the south.

The structure started construction in 1930 quite a distance from the high-rises that were just built or being built during that building boom such as The Drake and One South Broad. The building has a steel structure and it did not take long for the building to top out as the floor plates of the building are an estimated length and width of just 50 x 45 feet. The tower opened next year offering great views of Center City as one of the tallest towers in the city at the time.

To this day the building can still stand out on the skyline from certain views. During the day it can be very easy to spot the tower due to its red brick cladding. Despite the 364-foot height being small compared to the gigantic modern structures that dominate the skyline the building maintains its own character as at the time it was built slim towers such as this were rare. Now however a taller slender tower is proposed to rise nearby at 113-121 South 19th Street.

AP journalists and other tenants were safely evacuated from the 12-story al-Jalaa tower after the Israeli military warned of an imminent strike. Three heavy missiles hit the building within the hour disrupting coverage of the ongoing conflict between’ Gaza’s Hamas rulers and Israel. At least 145 people in Gaza and eight in Israel have been killed since the fighting erupted on Monday night.

“The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today” AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said. He said the American news agency was seeking information from the Israeli government and engaging with the U.S. State Department to learn more.

Mostefa Souag acting director-general of Al-Jazeera Media Network called the strike a “war crime” and a “clear act” to stop journalists from reporting on the conflict. Kuwait state television also had office space in the now-collapsed Gaza City building.

“The targeting of news organizations is completely unacceptable even during an armed conflict. It represents a gross violation of human rights and internationally agreed norms” Barbara Trionfi the executive director of the International Press Institute said.

In a standard Israeli response the military said that Hamas was operating inside the building and it accused the militant group of using journalists as human shields. But it provided no evidence to back up the claims.

Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus claimed that Hamas used the building for a military intelligence office and weapons development. He alleged “a highly advanced technological tool” that the militant group used in the fighting was “within or on the building.”

But Conricus said he could not provide evidence to back up the claims without “compromising” intelligence efforts. He added however: “I think it’s a legitimate request to see more information and I will try to provide it.”

Pruitt the AP’s CEO said the news agency had been in the building for 15 years and “we have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building.”

“We have called on the Israeli government to put forward the evidence” he said. “This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.”

Some press freedom advocates said the strike raised suspicions that Israel was trying to hinder coverage of the conflict. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists demanded Israel “provide a detailed and documented justification” for the strike.

“This latest attack on a building long known by Israel to house international media raises the specter that the Israel Defense Forces is deliberately targeting media facilities in order to disrupt coverage of the human suffering in Gaza” the group’s executive director Joel Simon said in a statement.

The Washington-based National Press Club called the strike “part of a pattern this week of Israeli forces destroying buildings in Gaza that house media organizations” and also questioned whether the assaults seek to “impair independent and accurate coverage of the conflict.”

“We call upon Israeli authorities to halt strikes on facilities known to house press” the National Press Club said. “Reliable media organizations are the best sources of accurate information about events in Gaza and they must not be prevented from doing their vital job.”

The bombing followed media consternation over an Israeli military statement that prompted some news organizations including The Wall Street Journal to erroneously report early Friday that Israel had launched a ground invasion of Gaza.

Israeli military commentators said the media had been used in a ruse to lure Hamas militants into a deadly trap. Conricus denied that the military engaged in a deliberate deception when it tweeted falsely Friday that ground forces were engaging in Gaza calling it “an honest mistake.”

The AP based on its analysis of the army’s statement phone calls to military officials and on the ground reporting in Gaza concluded there was no ground incursion and did not report there was one.

The strike on a building known to have the offices of international media outlets came as a shock to reporters who had felt relatively protected there.

“Now one can understand the feeling of the people whose homes have been destroyed by such kind of air attacks” Al-Jazeera producer Safwat al-Kahlout who was at the bureau in Gaza when the evacuation warning came told the broadcaster Saturday. “It’s really difficult to wake up one day and then you realize that your office is not there with all the career experiences memories that you’ve had.”

AP’s top floor offices and roof terrace on the now-destroyed building had provided a prime location for covering fighting in Gaza. The news agency’s camera offered 24-hour live shots this week as Hamas rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city.

Just a day before the bombing AP correspondent Fares Akram wrote in a personal story that the AP office was the only place in Gaza were he felt “somewhat safe.”

“The Israeli military has the coordinates of the high-rise so it’s less likely a bomb will bring it crashing down” Akram wrote.

The next day Akram tweeted about running from the building and watching its destruction from afar.

The New York Times joined other news organizations in expressing alarm about the targeting of al-Jalaa tower.

“The ability of the press to report on the ground is a profoundly important issue that has an impact on everyone.” the newspaper’s vice president of communications Danielle Rhoades Ha said. “A free and independent press is essential to helping to inform people bridge differences and end the conflict.”

The Philadelphia Inquirer

CONSHOHOCKEN Pa. — Lisa Lilick and Carol Smith struggled to get fellow Conshohocken residents to pay attention to their campaign opposing the sale of the borough’s sewer system. Who wants to think about boring wastewater when there’s a pandemic going on?

“Then Carol she did the little thing with a toilet” said Lilick.

The “little thing” was a simple image that Smith dug up on a Google search a cartoon commode with a worried expression and the palm of its hand held up. “No to sewer sale” the cartoon toilet intoned. “Bad for residents seniors fixed income.”

Lilick said her online posts about sewer rates suddenly found an audience. A Facebook page was launched local bloggers took note a petition was organized and yard signs went up. Scores of angry residents tuned in to borough Zoom meetings worried that their elected officials were trying to pull a fast one.

The campaign worked. The Conshohocken council voted abruptly on March 17 to walk away from a $52 million offer for the sewer system which council had been quietly exploring for two years. Afterward Council President Colleen Leonard scolded residents to “become a little more involved instead of waiting until you’re in a panic mode and really don’t have all the facts you need to really decide something.”

If what we have here is failure to communicate Conshohocken is not alone.

Other efforts: Grassroots campaigns have emerged in several towns around Philadelphia opposing sales of municipal water and wastewater systems energized by distrustful residents who fear their towns are trading a one-time cash windfall for perpetual higher sewer rates under private owners.

In Norristown the seat of Montgomery County just up the Schuylkill from Conshohocken a citizen opposition group organized after the municipal council voted in June to sell its sewer system for $82 million.

The group Norristown Opposes Privatization Efforts or NOPE gathered more than 2000 signatures that would have forced a repeal referendum on the ballot. The buyer Aqua Pennsylvania walked away in December.

“I think the average resident felt they were getting the wool pulled over their eyes” said Councilman Hakim Jones one of two council members who voted against the sale. He said the NOPE activists “did more education on the matter in a small period of time than we were able to do as a municipality in a full year and a half.”

NOPE’s success inspired it to broaden its horizons. Renamed Neighbors Opposing Privatization Efforts NOPE helped organize the Conshohocken campaign and is now advising residents in Towamencin a Montgomery County township that is studying a potential sewer sale said David McMahon a founder. It’s also advising a citizens group in Carteret County North Carolina which in February agreed to sell its system to Aqua.

McMahon said local officials considering a sewer system sale may comply with laws requiring such transactions to be advertised but they often couch the deal in language not understood by the public and downplay the negative long-term rate impact. “Residents in an area don’t know what’s happening until it’s over basically” said McMahon a scenery builder for films and television.

Anti-privatization advocacy groups such as Food and Water Watch which assists local activist groups say that public opposition to utility sales is not unusual or new.

“We’ve seen this in Democratic cities or rural conservative towns” said Mary Grant the director of Food and Water Watch’s campaign against water privatizations. “It’s pretty common when these companies are aggressively trying to take over the water system or sewer system that people react negatively.”

Officials from Aqua the second-largest private water and wastewater operator in the state after Pennsylvania American Water said the number of towns where organized opposition has developed has increased only in proportion to the growing number of acquisitions underway.

“What you’re seeing is the volume of municipal transactions has really started to gallop” said Chris Franklin chief executive of Essential Utilities the Bryn Mawr parent company of Aqua. In many towns where Aqua is active he said there is no opposition to a sale. In others he said “people are saying their piece and in some cases it’s more active than others.”

Act 12: The frenzy of acquisitions in Pennsylvania is driven by a 2016 state law that encourages the consolidation of smaller water and wastewater systems under private ownership. The law called Act 12 allows investor-owned utilities to pay an appraised fair-market value for an acquired system — rather than its lower depreciated cost or “book value” — and then to recoup the costs through higher rates.

Fair-value laws enacted in about a dozen states have triggered a land rush by private buyers to pay top dollar for systems. Some acquisitive public authorities have also increased their offering prices to compete with private companies — Conshohocken’s preferred bidder was the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority which has acquired systems in Montgomery and Chester Counties. Under either public or private ownership the higher price is passed on to customers through higher rates.

New Jersey also approved a fair-value law but bidders are only allowed to recoup the higher market value they pay for municipal systems that can show they are in financial distress so there are fewer acquisitions.

In Pennsylvania there is no such restriction.

Rate concerns: Officials from five states told the U.S. General Accountability Office that one potential disadvantage of fair-market value laws is their potential to increase a utility’s rates according to a GAO report released Monday.

Five studies examined by the GAO found that average water rates charged by private for-profit utilities are about $15 to $21 higher per month than the rates charged by public water utilities. Private utilities have an incentive to generate a return for investors the GAO said while public utilities may need to respond to political pressures to keep rates low for all residents.

Every municipality has a different reason for approving or rejecting a privatization and different circumstances — they may require significant infrastructure investments that would be better managed by a larger private entity or already have high rates. Some towns just want to get out of the sewer business and focus on core public services.

“Some places have really bad sewer systems that are becoming very expensive to fix and they don’t have the revenue to fix them” said Chris Manero president of Plymouth Township Council in Montgomery County. “And some places have seen the chance to get a lot of cash.”

Plymouth Township explored a sale in 2019 but opted out after holding four town-hall meetings because projected increases were too high said Manero. The township will find some other way to pay for $15 million in needed renovations to municipal buildings he said.

But having gone through the exercise of examining and rejecting a sale two years ago Plymouth officials were worried this year when neighboring Conshohocken was considering selling its system. Conshohocken treats sewage from part of Plymouth which would have realized higher rates if Conshohocken sold its system while reaping none of the benefits.

Town vs. town: Plymouth Township’s anxiety over the sale of a neighboring town’s system highlights another challenge of privatization that potentially pits town vs. town: Municipal sewer systems are often interconnected with neighboring towns since sewer mains mostly flow downhill. One town’s decision to sell may impact customers in another municipality.

Such is the case in York County where Pennsylvania American Water Co. a subsidiary of Camden-based American Water Works Co. Inc. last month announced it will buy the York City Sewer Authority for $235 million. The sale will bail out the financially distressed city. But several surrounding municipalities whose customers pay York to treat their sewage will see higher rates. Those towns say they are examining their legal options.

Pennsylvania American also has signed agreements with Valley Township in Chester County and Royersford borough and Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.

Aqua has six acquisitions underway at a cost of $438 million the largest of which is a contentious $276 million acquisition of Delaware County’s sewer system DELCORA. That deal is tied up in court but Franklin the Aqua CEO talks about it as though a successful conclusion is inevitable.

“Based on the approximate rate base of $438 million these signed agreements are expected to generate about $22 million of incremental annual income when they’re fully earning and these are great examples of our acquisition strategy at work” Franklin told investment analysts in February during an Essential Utilities quarterly earnings teleconference.

Franklin lives in Willistown Township an affluent Chester County community around Malvern that agreed in January to sell its sewer system for $17.5 million to Aqua. The Willistown sale pits the town’s sewer customers vs. homeowners with septic systems.

Sewer customers who paid for the Willistown system with past fees and make up about half of the township’s residences say they will now face higher rates under Aqua ownership. For them it’s a question of equity — half of the town will pay more after the transaction but the whole town including septic customers will benefit from the proceeds of the sale.

“Basically public officials love to get their hands on free money right?” said Henry Yordan a sewer customer who helped organize an opposition group Concerned Willistown Sewer Customers. “They have all this free money and they didn’t have to go to the whole town to say `Hey we’re increasing your tax for all these wonderful things we’re doing.’”

Franklin’s view is that Willistown is having an internal disagreement about how to deploy the sale proceeds — sewer customers say the net earnings from the sale should be used to lower sewer rates or get refunded to sewer customers. After a series of online town-hall meetings Willistown’s leadership appears to be leaning toward apportioning at least some of the proceeds to rate relief. (Franklin is a Willistown sewer customer but obviously he supports the sale.)

Tied up in court: Another large transaction involving Aqua Pennsylvania is its uninvited $320 million takeover bid of the Chester Water Authority a public water system headquartered in Chester city but whose customers are mostly in suburban Delaware and Chester Counties. The sale would bail out financially distressed Chester city which created the authority at the expense of suburban water customers who would pay more.

The Chester Water Authority countered with a proposed $60 million takeover that would bail out the City of Chester and thwart Aqua’s bid. Aqua has sued and the transaction is tied up in court.

In response to public outcry two state legislators from suburban CWA counties State Reps. John A. Lawrence (R-Chester) and Christina D. Sappey (D-Chester) have introduced bills that would require the sale of public water systems to get voter approval.

“Innocent people living on fixed incomes in my district shouldn’t pay for the fact that the City of Chester needs to be bailed out” said Sappey who reintroduced her Water Payers Bill of Rights this year after it failed to get any traction last year. “We’ve got to find another solution to that problem.”

In Conshohocken the exploration of a sewer sale was initiated two years ago as part of a review of borough assets. Like many towns the borough has a long list of needs — police streets aging municipal buildings storm-water management — and limited sources of funds. A sewer system sale presented an opportunity to pay for all of the borough’s $28 million wish list in one transaction.

Transparency concerns: In February the borough council approved an ordinance transferring the sewer assets from the Borough of Conshohocken Authority which oversees the sewer system to the borough itself. Opponents interpreted that as a signal that the council was moving to sell.

“The borough was not transparent” said Carol Smith a pharmaceutical-industry retiree who serves on the Borough of Conshohocken Authority and the creator of the cartoon toilet that became the mascot of the opposition.

“We were told things were going to take months they were just doing an inquiry but the goalposts kept shifting” Smith said. “We thought `We gotta alert people to this.’ ”

Borough Manager Stephanie Cecco said the borough council was not being sneaky but careful and deliberate about considering differing views.

“There’s a group of people that have a loud voice and an initiative that they want to accomplish but that’s not the only dynamic that we’re dealing with” said Cecco. “There’s a whole other part of the population of Conshohocken that doesn’t understand why you turned down $52 million.”

Conshohocken will now consider other ways to finance needed improvements. One option is to get sewer users to pay higher fees and to take over the costs of managing and upgrading Conshohocken’s storm sewers now paid out of the borough’s budget.

Cecco said there’s no hard feelings -- it’s a small borough and residents are neighborly. For elected officials the exercise of getting bids for the sewer system was also useful she said.

It gives them options.

“Now they have data in hand on the value of one of its major assets” Cecco said “which they could use in the future if they need it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY4MjExMjEwMDAxNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mini review: Will artificial sweeteners discharged to the aqueous environment unintentionally “sweeten” the taste of tap ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666821121000168 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY4MjExMjEwMDAxNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY4MjExMjEwMDAyMzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electrocoagulation-flocculation of aquaculture effluent using hybrid iron and aluminium electrodes: A comparative study,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666821121000235 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI2NjY4MjExMjEwMDAyMzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1500-2000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals BoA reported.

The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus the impact of the ongoing chip shortage is not limited to semiconductor stocks since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle BoA noted.

Similar to industrial stocks semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus in 5G broadband and domestic chip manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist in semiconductor stocks they are offset by “solid visibility” that is driven by non-cancellable orders product customization and broad-based demand BoA concluded.

Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in gross margins signaling that semiconductor companies are “very effective” in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a positive driver for the sector BoA noted. As a result the SOX index has benefitted from rising rates historically.

“Over the past five years chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X” said Hilary Kramer who hosts the nationally aired “Millionaire Maker” radio program and heads the GameChangers and Value Authority advisory services.

Value investments had been trouncing growth stocks heading into trading on May 11 with the Russell 3000 Value Index up 19.1% in 2021 compared to a gain of 4.3% for the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested “a rest” would be overdue and healthy for the market.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates suggesting the market growth will last beyond 2022 Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage semiconductor stocks have not performed well since early April.

Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is “not great” but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

The top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) a Santa Clara California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA’s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS) above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers.

Potential catalysts for AMAT’s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity upgrades market share loss in key segments merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds BoA noted.

Lam Research Ranks Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

BoA gave Lam Research a $725 price target based on 20x cash adjusted 2022E P/E within the stock’s historical range of 8x-24x and based on LRCX’s 20%-plus EPS growth rate. Amid a multi-year wafer fabrication equipment growth cycle LRCX is well positioned to benefit the investment firm wrote.

Potential upside catalysts to LRCX’s price objective are stronger-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity increased semiconductor equipment sales and improved market share. Downside risks are a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity additions and a market share loss.

NVDA Gains Place Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

A BoA buy recommendation NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%.

In addition BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU) as well as its software and development ecosystem BoA added.

Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E excluding cash at the higher-end of NVDA’s historical 20x-54x P/E range showing NVIDIA’s superior long-term growth profile in large underpenetrated markets according to BoA.

Risks to achieving BoA’s price objective include NVDA’s exposure to the personal computer market competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors “lumpy and unpredictable sales” in new enterprise data center and auto markets potential reduced capital returns possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.

Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman

“The semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology” said Bob Carlson chairman of the Board of Trustees of Virginia’s Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. “Asian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.”

The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage said Carlson who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).

But he continued to tinker with the circuit seeing just how much improvement was possible out of this simple setup. He squeezes a bit of extra resolution out of the PWM DAC circuit by using the Timer1 library to obtain 1024 instead of 256 steps. For reading voltages he implements oversampling (and in some cases oversampling again) to eke out a few extra bits of resolution from the 10-bit ADC of the Nano. The whole thing is controlled by a Python / Qt script to generate the desired plots.

While it works and gives him the IV curves this simplicity comes at a price. It’s slow — [Joseph] reports that it takes several minutes to trace out five different values of base current on a transistor. It was this lack of speed that inspired him to name the project after cartoon character Speedy Gonzales’s cousin Slowpoke Rodriguez AKA “the slowest mouse in all of Mexico”. In addition to being painstakingly slow the tracer is limited to 5 volts and currents under 5 milliamps.

[Joseph] documents the whole design and build process over on his blog and has made the source code available on GitHub should you want to try this yourself. We covered another interesting IV curve tracer build on cardboard ten years ago but that one is much bigger than the Rodriguez.",,,,,,,,,

Such is the first word on Cruella the Disney-villainess origin story starring Emma Stone as the iconic One Hundred and One Dalmatians character. Critics' first reactions hit social media on Friday praising the movie as ""wickedly fun"" and ""absolutely divine"" with several comparing it to The Devil Wears Prada.

Rotten Tomatoes' Joel Meares went further writing ""If Devil Wears Prada meets The Witches meets Death Becomes Her sounds like your jam see it.""

The reactions particularly praised the performances of Stone and Paul Walter Hauser (who plays Horace one of the thieves hired by Cruella) the film's soundtrack and the extravagant costumes. (""Costume designer Jenny Beavan deserves 3rd billing"" critic Courtney Howard wrote.) Multiple writers also noted that the film features a ""totally unambiguous"" LGBTQ character which marks a major step forward for Disney's representation of the community on screen.

Cruella follows an aspiring fashion designer named Estella (Stone) in 1970s London who clashes with Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson) the ruthless leader of a fashion house. Estella later hatches a plot to steal the Baroness' Dalmatians combining a thirst for vengeance with a desire to dominate the fashion world.

Disney will release the film May 28 in theaters and on Disney+ via the ""Premier Access"" strategy used for Mulan and Raya and the Last Dragon with the film available to subscribers for an additional $29.99. Check out more reactions from critics below.

But iOS 14.5 also introduced support for the new Apple AirTag which risks doing the opposite.

For the uninitiated an AirTag is a small device (similar to a Tile) that can be attached to personal items such as keys wallets or luggage. The tag periodically sends messages that can be used to track its location letting you find any lost or missing items with the help of an app.

While clearly useful AirTags can also potentially be misused. Concerns have been raised they might facilitate stalking for example.

And there’s also a more fundamental issue with this technology. Its euphemistic description as a “crowdsourced” way to recover lost items belies the reality of how these items are tracked.

What you won’t find highlighted in the polished marketing statements is the fact that AirTags can only work by tapping into an Apple-operated surveillance network in which millions of us are unwitting participants.

So how exactly do AirTags work?

AirTags are small circular metal discs slightly larger and thicker than an Australian one-dollar coin. Once paired with your Apple ID the tag’s location will be shown in the “Find My” app whenever location data are available.

Apple newsroom

Each tag transmits a unique identifier using Bluetooth. Any compatible Apple device within range (up to 100 metres in ideal conditions) will then relay that identifier to Apple’s servers along with its own location data. The tag’s owner can then log onto the Find My app and access those location details and bingo — you now have a pretty good idea of where your lost bag is.

The AirTags themselves have no positional location capability – they do not contain GPS technology. Rather they merely “ping” the nearest Bluetooth-enabled device and let that device’s location data do the rest.

Besides Bluetooth AirTags also use a relatively new technology called Ultra Wideband. This new feature is supported only by recent Apple devices such as iPhone 11 and 12 and allows for much more precise location tracking.

This precision extends to directional finding – now your phone can literally point you towards the missing tag.

Apple newsroom

While the actual nature of the data transmitted is not too concerning (tag ID and location) what makes it worrying is the sheer scale and number of devices involved. By using an AirTag you are effectively availing yourself of a global monitoring network containing millions and millions of devices.

Everyone’s iPhone (assuming Bluetooth is enabled) is listening for AirTags. When it “hears” one it uploads details of that tag’s identifier and the phone’s location to Apple’s servers.

Besides any privacy concerns this also likely uses small amounts of your data allowance. That’s probably fine most of the time but if you are travelling internationally you might be hit with unexpected charges if you’ve forgotten to disable data roaming.

Stalking technology?

Apple says it has implemented a range of safeguards to detect and prevent attempts to use AirTags for stalking including an alert triggered when an AirTag seems to be accompanying someone who’s not its owner. The alert can appear on the victim’s phone (if they use an iPhone) but can also raise an audible alert on the tag itself. But these measures are relatively easy to circumvent.

One experiment showed a tag can be placed on a person and would not trigger any of the safeguards if reconnected to the stalker’s device regularly enough. This could be done by the victim returning home or within range of their stalker within a three-day window.

More concerningly the alerts can be turned off – which a victim of domestic violence may be coerced into doing by their aggressor. What’s more as AirTags and similar devices become more common we will inevitably encounter more warnings of tags appearing around us. Just like other commonly encountered alerts many users will tire of seeing them and dismiss the prompts.

It is also presumably only a matter of time until these devices are hacked and put to other nefarious purposes.

Apple isn’t the only technology company drawing unwitting users into large networks. Amazon’s SideWalk creates a network that allows your neighbours’ doorbell to connect through your Echo device (if their WiFi doesn’t extend to the front door) effectively sharing your internet connection!

All of this functionality (and the inherent privacy risks) are covered in the standard terms and conditions. That lengthy legalese document we never read allows tech companies to hide behind the claim that we have willingly opted into all this.

Can we opt out?

A simple option to avoid your device acting as a cog in Apple’s machine is to turn off Bluetooth and location services. With Bluetooth disabled your device won’t “see” the beacons coming from AirTags and without location services you can’t report the proximity of the tag.

Of course turning off this functionality means losing useful capabilities such as hands-free kits Bluetooth speakers and satellite navigation and of course makes it harder to find your phone if you lose it.

Ultimately if we want to benefit from the ability to locate missing keys wallets and luggage through AirTags we have to accept that this is only possible through a global network of sensors – even if those sensors are our own phones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L2FwcGxlLWlwb2QtdXNiLXBvd2VyLWFkYXB0ZXItaXBvZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Apple Computer iPod USB Power Adapter,"Pros: Apple’s official USB-port equipped version of the iPod FireWire Power Adapter that comes with all Dock Connector-iPods; made mostly for on-the-go recharging of the iPod shuffle but is also compatible with Dock Connector iPods.

Advertisements

Cons: Duplicates the charging functionality of most PC owners’ powered USB ports high price for a cableless power cube.

Though Apple’s iPod shuffle Dock was certainly amongst the simplest products we’ve reviewed the company’s new iPod USB Power Adapter ($29) is in the same league. Developed primarly for use with the iPod shuffle the iPod USB Power Adapter is identical to the standard FireWire-compatible charger that ships with every iPod save the shuffle only with a female USB port instead of a female FireWire port.

Advertisements

Currently iPod shuffle owners who want to recharge their batteries need a computer or a standalone device with a powered USB port (such as Apple’s AirPort Express ($129 iLounge rating: A-)) to accomplish the feat. For obvious reasons – namely the shuffle’s super-small size – travelers and commuters may not want to carry a charger that’s considerably larger and/or more expensive than the shuffle just to keep its battery topped off. The iPod USB Power Adapter is Apple’s least expensive standalone shuffle charging solution.

Advertisements

You plug it into the wall and the iPod shuffle directly into its USB port and your battery safely recharges.

Interestingly the iPod USB Power Adapter doesn’t follow the green packaging conventions of the iPod shuffle Dock – it ships in a standard white iPod-badged accessory box and its instruction manual touts its compatibility with all Dock Connector iPods. When connected to a Dock Connector iPod it performs the same recharging functionality as a computer or as the FireWire-based charger; the only difference is that it takes advantage of the second of two Apple cables included in every Dock Connecting iPod box. There’s no USB cable included in the Power Adapter’s box so if you’re already using your iPod’s pack-ins (or didn’t receive a USB cable with your third-generation iPod) you’ll need to buy one separately.

Advertisements

In our view the value of the iPod USB Power Adapter will depend on the person and iPod using it. It’s best suited to iPod shuffle owners who use the shuffle a lot but don’t have constant access to a computer for recharging and is also potentially useful for Mac and other FireWire users who would prefer not to disconnect their FireWire cables from their computers for in-wall recharging.

These people may like the fact that the iPod USB Power Adapter is easily paired with the 4G/mini/photo iPod’s packed-in USB cable and a Dock for connection to a home stereo or just with the USB cable for recharging at a second location. Everyone else however will likely find the iPod USB Power Adapter unnecessary. Apple’s almost universally packed-in FireWire charger is perfectly suited to the needs of most PC users who typically keep their USB cables connected to their computers and FireWire cables connected to their walls.

Advertisements

Though the iPod USB Power Adapter is fairly marketed as an iPod and iPod shuffle accessory it’s telling that Apple didn’t release it until the shuffle debuted: it wasn’t otherwise necessary and is far more a shuffler’s peripheral than a standard iPod owner’s. We won’t harp on the iPod USB Power Adapter’s $29 price beyond to repeat what we said when Apple released the iPod shuffle Dock: the price is high and it would have been nice if the two items were packaged together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1tYWtlcy1hcHBsZS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Makes Apple Successful?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1tYWtlcy1hcHBsZS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzQuY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEveWVzLXlvdXItaXBob25lLWlzLXRha2luZy1pbnZpc2libGUtcGljdHVyZXMtb2YteW91L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yes your phone is taking 'invisible' pictures of you,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.abc4.com/news/tech-social-media/yes-your-iphone-is-taking-invisible-pictures-of-you/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzQuY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEveWVzLXlvdXItaXBob25lLWlzLXRha2luZy1pbnZpc2libGUtcGljdHVyZXMtb2YteW91L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vOXRvNW1hYy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNS9ibG9vbWJlcmctdGhlLWFwcGxlLWFuZC1taWNyb3NvZnQtcml2YWxyeS1pcy1iYWNrLWhlcmVzLXdoeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bloomberg: The Apple and Microsoft rivalry is back here’s why,"A new report by Bloomberg shows that Apple and Microsoft’s rivalry is back. While tension surfaced during the Epic Games trial the two companies are set to compete in everything from cloud computing to mixed reality.

For the past few years Apple and Microsoft appeared to be on good terms. For example Microsoft’s Office and other apps began appearing on the iPad and iPhone and a Redmond executive was even invited to an Apple product launch. The company also made it easier to use Xbox game controllers on its devices as Microsoft embraced Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard compatibility in its iPadOS apps.

But around November when Apple introduced the first Mac with the M1 chip things started to change. The company hired actor John Hodgman as known as the “PC guy” to promote its new Macs. Then Intel losing Apple’s partnership in the long term hired the “Mac guy” actor to promote Intel-powered PCs over Macs and iPads.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that another breakpoint was Microsoft’s attempt to debut its cloud gaming service for iOS devices and Apple didn’t let the company launch the product as it intended to:

“One app would let users pay a monthly fee to Microsoft and stream dozens of different gaming titles from the cloud. The service was supposed to do for gaming what Netflix did for video appease gamers and turn Apple devices into a more powerful gaming platform backed by Xbox one of the hottest names in the industry. But Microsoft never launched the service in its intended form having failed to persuade Apple to loosen App Store rules forbidding all-in-one gaming services. (…) A few months after concerns over the ban on streaming apps went public Apple tweaked the rules. Microsoft can now launch a cloud gaming service but each game must be downloaded separately defeating the purpose of an all-in-one solution.”

Gurman quotes other reasons as Microsoft began urging U.S. and European antitrust regulators to examine Apple’s practices and Mac’s market share growing while Windows PCs have stagnated.

In the long term both companies are set to compete on the same segments as Apple is planning to release a mixed-reality headset in 2022 which could be a problem for Microsoft’s HoloLens.

Gurman also says both companies “are also competing for talent in AI and cloud infrastructure two key future battlegrounds.”

What we know for now is that the Apple vs Microsoft rivalry is back and will divide tech fans for years to come Mac and PC guys will soon face each other again."

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1500-2000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals BoA reported.

The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus the impact of the ongoing chip shortage is not limited to semiconductor stocks since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle BoA noted.

Similar to industrial stocks semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus in 5G broadband and domestic chip manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist in semiconductor stocks they are offset by “solid visibility” that is driven by non-cancellable orders product customization and broad-based demand BoA concluded.

Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in gross margins signaling that semiconductor companies are “very effective” in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a positive driver for the sector BoA noted. As a result the SOX index has benefitted from rising rates historically.

“Over the past five years chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X” said Hilary Kramer who hosts the nationally aired “Millionaire Maker” radio program and heads the GameChangers and Value Authority advisory services.

Value investments had been trouncing growth stocks heading into trading on May 11 with the Russell 3000 Value Index up 19.1% in 2021 compared to a gain of 4.3% for the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested “a rest” would be overdue and healthy for the market.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates suggesting the market growth will last beyond 2022 Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage semiconductor stocks have not performed well since early April.

Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is “not great” but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

The top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) a Santa Clara California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA’s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS) above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers.

Potential catalysts for AMAT’s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity upgrades market share loss in key segments merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds BoA noted.

A BoA buy recommendation NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%.

In addition BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU) as well as its software and development ecosystem BoA added.

Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E excluding cash at the higher-end of NVDA’s historical 20x-54x P/E range showing NVIDIA’s superior long-term growth profile in large underpenetrated markets according to BoA.

Risks to achieving BoA’s price objective include NVDA’s exposure to the personal computer market competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors “lumpy and unpredictable sales” in new enterprise data center and auto markets potential reduced capital returns possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.

Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman

“The semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology” said Bob Carlson chairman of the Board of Trustees of Virginia’s Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. “Asian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.”

The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage said Carlson who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).

We're a step closer to finding one,"Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death around the world. The disease is primarily caused by the bite of mosquitoes carrying a parasite. In 2019 around 229 million malaria cases were reported with an estimated number of 409000 deaths. Most of the reported cases occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Children younger than five years and pregnant women are most prone to malaria.

To prevent malaria the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends spraying insecticides indoors and using bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticide.

These interventions have one big flaw however. They focus on minimising malaria infections indoors. Infections can still occur outdoors. And in some African countries resistance to insecticides – especially pyrethroids – is emerging. So new methods to control mosquitoes are needed urgently.

Numerous repellent-based products such as creams roll-ons and sprays are available on the market for outdoor protection. Most of these have a very short period of protection – a few hours. People need to be protected from mosquito bites for longer.

To address this problem our research project aims to develop a new cost-effective product such as an anklet or bracelet to repel mosquitoes for an extended period.

A possible method of achieving this is to use polyolefin strands filled with mosquito repellents (DEET and icaridin). Polyolefins are the most extensively used group of thermoplastics polymers because of their strength light weight low cost easy processability and good water barrier properties. This would make the total cost of the repellent-based product affordable.

Our research

Our project is a collaboration between the Institute of Applied Materials and the Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control at the University of Pretoria in South Africa alongside Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany and Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique.

In essence we apply our skills in chemical and polymer technology to design and develop products that may help to reduce the malaria burden.

We’re trying a technology that releases chemicals from the plastic in a controlled way. We want the active ingredients of the mosquito repellent to emerge gradually and at the same concentration over a prolonged period of time.

The polymer product acts as a reservoir for suitable repellents by trapping the active ingredients inside a polymer matrix. The release rate is controlled by a membrane-like structure at the surface of the system.

author supplied

We tested the polymer strands filled with repellents – DEET and icaridin – over a period of 12 weeks. This means each repellent-polymer strand lasts 12 weeks. DEET is the key active ingredient in many commercial mosquito-repellent formulations. It is also an environment-friendly compound. Icaridin is also a safe and effective repellent that has been available for many years for mosquito application. We tested the strands under controlled conditions in an insectary to determine their activity against mosquitoes. Caged mosquitoes were offered the opportunity to feed on both treated and untreated body parts of human volunteers. Three hundred mosquitoes were placed in a large netting cage. The volunteers could put their legs into the cage through portals.

The test strand 3 metres long was wound around one leg of a volunteer leaving the other leg fully exposed. Both legs were then inserted into the cage one leg per entry hole and the person stood still for five minutes. After five minutes two other people used flashlights to count the number of mosquitoes on the lower leg of the test person. The numbers of mosquitoes on the treated and untreated legs were recorded separately.

The result showed that most of the mosquitoes chose to feed on untreated legs. The novel repellent-based polymer product has a longer lifespan – 12 weeks more than commercially available repellents. It has the added benefit of not only repelling mosquitoes but killing them too if they make contact with it. And the polyolefins are widely available and cost effective. This would make the final product affordable – an important consideration.

More extensive and rigorous entomological and epidemiological testing would have to be done on products like this before they could become commercially acceptable.

Looking ahead

Malaria cannot be eliminated by just one vector control method. An integrated multidisciplinary approach is needed.

New safe and sustainable methods need to be researched and developed to overcome current resistance trends and prevent transmission of malaria from all angles.

Our research opens the door to a new mosquito repellent formulation that improves the armoury against malaria.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY3NzMyMjIxMDA0MjMy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction effect of ethanol molecules on doxorubicin drug delivery using single-walled carbon nanotube carrier ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167732221004232 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY3NzMyMjIxMDA0MjMy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY3NTc3WDIxMDAxMzAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An efficient WN catalyst nitrogenized from morphology-controllable WO3 for oxygen reduction reaction,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167577X21001300 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTY3NTc3WDIxMDAxMzAw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Lisa Kudrow has opened up about the close bonds on the set of Friends revealing that her son used to think Jennifer Aniston was his mother.

The Friends star who played Phoebe Buffay on the long-running sitcom shared the amusing detail during an appearance on Conan on Wednesday.

Speaking with host Conan O’Brien about how her son Julian 23 grew up on the set of the show Kudrow acknowledged that there was a time when he thought that her co-star was his mother.

“He got a little confused I know that he was really obsessed with Jen Aniston” O’Brien began prompting Kudrow to reply: “No no he’d fly into her lap.”

“Well she’s a love bug and that made sense. And I was always glad for anyone that Julian felt love for and felt from” Kudrow continued adding: “But then at home she’d be on TV and he’d go: ‘Mommy!’”

After laughing about her son’s confusion Kudrow said that the moments weren’t necessarily scarring but that she does still remember them.

“I’m kind of analytical so I’m like: ‘Is this wishful thinking? Do they have some kind of higher soul connection that I don’t have with him?’” she jokingly told O’Brien of her thought process. “Well I’m happy for both of them.”

Elsewhere during the interview the 57-year-old revealed that her son has seen some of the Friends episodes but hasn’t watched all of them.

Explaining that she doesn’t know why exactly Kudrow said that she knows her son hasn’t seen “every episode” but that he saw some because he felt like he had to when all of his friends in school were watching the sitcom.

“I know for a while in school people were watching it and he kind of felt like he had to” Kudrow said adding that her son thought all of the other cast members were “very funny”.

Even before frequented the set of the show during his childhood Julian appeared on the sitcom as Kudrow was pregnant with him during season four.

The highly anticipated Friends reunion will air on HBO Max on 27 May after the special was delayed numerous times due to the pandemic.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$206. We generally don't like to see insider selling but the lower the sale price the more it concerns us. In this case the big sale took place at around the current price so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

Une décision qui semble à vents contraires des préconisations écologiques pour lutter contre la crise climatique.

Au coup de sifflet final le gardien brésilien aux allures de géant (191 m) a laissé couler ses larmes en recevant l’accolade de ses coéquipiers de Jürgen Klopp et de quelques adversaires.

En févier son père José Becker 57 ans était mort noyé et Alisson n’avait pas pu assister à ses obsèques en raison des restrictions de voyage liées à la COVID-19.

« Je suis trop ému. Ces derniers mois avec tout ce qui s’est passé pour moi pour ma famille… » a-t-il commencé au micro de Sky Sports après le match.

« Le soccer c’est ma vie. J’y ai toujours joué dans mes plus lointains souvenirs avec mon père et j’espère qu’il était là pour le voir » a-t-il poursuivi.

Il est ensuite revenu sur le match âpre face à des Baggies déjà condamnés à la descente et sur son but victorieux une déviation parfaite de la tête sur corner au bout des quatre minutes de temps additionnel.

« Parfois on se bat mais les choses ne se passent juste pas comme on voudrait comme cet après-midi. Mais en marquant ce but je suis très très heureux d’aider [mon équipe] parce qu’on s’est vraiment battu ensemble et qu’on a un énorme objectif se qualifier en Ligue des champions » a-t-il dit.

Lorsque Liverpool a bénéficié d’un dernier coup de pied de coin « j’ai regardé le banc mais personne ne m’a appelé. Après c’était juste le timing parfait le centre était superbe et j’ai juste essayé de mettre la tête. Je crois que c’est l’un des plus beaux buts que j’aie jamais vus [rires]. En tout cas c’est le plus beau que j’ai marqué » a-t-il ajouté dans un sourire.

« On ne peut pas expliquer ce genre de choses c’est juste le soccer […] Il y a beaucoup de choses qu’on peut expliquer dans la vie mais pour ce type de choses c’est Dieu qui a mis sa main sur ma tête aujourd’hui et je me sens vraiment béni » a ajouté le Brésilien très croyant.

Grâce à cette victoire Liverpool 5e a de fortes chances d’intégrer le top 4 qui envoie en C1 l’an prochain s’il gagne ses deux derniers matchs à Burnley et contre Crystal Palace.

Miller (Ducati) remporte ainsi sa deuxième victoire consécutive à l’issue d’une course perturbée par la pluie qui a obligé les pilotes à changer de machines en début de course pour utiliser celles équipées de pneus pour piste mouillée.

Zarco (Ducati-Pramac) a échoué à moins de cinq secondes de Miller après une remontée dans la deuxième partie de course Quartararo (Yamaha) assurant la troisième place qui lui permet de reprendre la tête du championnat avec un point d’avance sur l’Italien Francesco Bagnaia (Ducati) quatrième dimanche.

« Le vent s’est ajouté à la pluie et j’ai cru que la course allait être arrêtée » a déclaré Miller qui a en plus été contraint d’observer une double pénalité (tour rallongé) pendant la course pour avoir dépassé la limite de vitesse dans la voie des stands pendant qu’il changeait de moto.

« Deux victoires de suite c’est fantastique » s’est-il félicité. Il remonte à la 4e place du championnat et remporte sa 3e victoire en MotoGP.

« Peut-être que si on avait changé de moto un tout petit plus tôt on aurait pu gagner la course » a affirmé pour sa part Johann Zarco qui obtient sa 3e seconde place cette saison et remonte à la 3e place du championnat derrière Quartararo et Bagnaia.

« Je suis si heureux c’est comme une victoire pour moi » a souligné lui Quartararo indiquant que son pneu avant était complètement usé à la fin de l’épreuve.

Cette défaite sonne comme un revers cinglant pour Chelsea à qui l’égalisation a été refusée par la VAR à une minute de la fin du temps réglementaire à deux semaines de la finale de la Ligue des Champions à Porto contre Manchester City.

Toujours pas assurés de disputer la prochaine C1 via le championnat les Londoniens ont encore trois matchs cette saison deux en Premier League et leur finale européenne pour éviter une énorme désillusion.

« Je pense qu’on a juste manqué d’un peu de réussite aujourd’hui. Je ne vois pas comment Leicester aurait pu gagner ce match sans ce tir dans la lucarne sorti de nulle part » a estimé l’Allemand après la rencontre assurant ne rien avoir à reprocher à ses joueurs.

Pour les Foxes qui avaient perdu leurs quatre finales précédentes dans la compétition la dernière remontant à 1969 c’est la récompense d’un travail de longue haleine mené par Brendan Rodgers depuis son arrivée en février 2019.

« La Coupe d’Angleterre partout dans le monde mais surtout dans la culture britannique est un moment tellement à part » a estimé celui qui restait jusqu’ici surtout associé au titre qu’il avait laissé échapper avec Liverpool en 2014 alors que les Reds comptaient cinq points d’avance à trois journées de la fin.

Disputée devant 21 000 personnes dans le cadre de l’assouplissement progressif des mesures anti-COVID-19 par le gouvernement britannique cette rencontre n’a pas atteint des sommets en termes de spectacle malgré son final dramatique.

Elle a confirmé la solidité défensive de deux équipes portées vers un jeu de transition qui n’a pas vraiment trouvé à s’exprimer samedi.

Premier entraîneur allemand sur le banc d’une finale de Coupe d’Angleterre Tuchel ancien coach du Paris SG n’a pu une fois encore que constater les difficultés de son équipe à créer le danger.

Et si Leicester n’a pas non plus eu pléthore d’occasions il a su profité d’un ballon récupéré près de la ligne médiane et transmis à leur métronome belge du milieu de terrain pour faire la différence.

D’une frappe du droit tendue Tielemans a trouvé la lucarne droite d’un Kepa qui n’a rien pu faire (1-0 63e) pour faire chavirer les supporters de Leicester.

En face les Blues ont certes dominé et eu la possession mais ils n’ont que très rarement inquiété le gardien adverse avant le dernier quart d’heure.

Dans une défense abandonnée par son leader Jonny Evans blessé dès la 34e minute le jeune Français Wesley Fofana 20 ans a particulièrement brillé à l’image d’une première saison impressionnante de maturité et de décontraction.

Werner encore trop discret

Juste avant la demi-heure de jeu la défense centrale de Chelsea avait eu la meilleure opportunité Cesar Azpilicueta manquant d’un rien de la tête un ballon effleuré par Timo Werner après une combinaison entre Thiago Silva et Antonio Rüdiger (29e).

Les Blues se sont ensuite montrés plus pressants en fin de match une tête de Ben Chilwell étant effleurée par Kasper Schmeichel et détournée sur le poteau (78e) avant que le portier international danois ne réalise une parade exceptionnelle sur une volée de Mason Mount (87e).

« C’est un gardien de classe mondiale qui n’a pas la reconnaissance qu’il mérite parce qu’il est tellement régulier et il a une telle concentration […] j’ai beaucoup de chance de l’avoir » l’a complimenté Rodgers après le match.

Chelsea chez qui Olivier Giroud avait remplacé à la 83e un Timo Werner une nouvelle fois trop discret a pourtant bien cru égaliser sur un but contre son camp des Foxes à la 89e. Mais la VAR a annulé le but pour un hors-jeu de Chilwell au départ de l’action.

Champion d’Angleterre surprise en 2016 Leicester écrit une nouvelle belle page de son histoire et offre aussi un beau cadeau à Jamie Vardy son buteur qui est devenu le premier joueur de l’histoire à avoir disputé sur ses 14 ans de carrière tous les tours de la Coupe d’Angleterre du premier tour préliminaire quand il jouait en amateur à la finale."

(1:19)

Open Extended Reactions

The Indiana Pacers have submitted 78 instances of incorrect or non-calls to the NBA that they felt put them at a disadvantage in Games 1 and 2 against the New York Knicks a league source told ESPN.

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle speaking after Indiana fell behind 2-0 in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 130-121 loss to New York on Wednesday said the team had identified 29 questionable refereeing decisions from Game 1. The source said the Pacers then identified 49 plays from Game 2 that they felt were incorrectly called or not called at all and submitted them overnight to the NBA office.

Carlisle said they had decided not to send the Game 1 calls to the league office for review but reversed that decision after Game 2 had similar officiating issues from their perspective.

As part of NBA protocol the clips will also be shared with the Knicks.

""I can promise you that we're going to submit these tonight"" Carlisle said after being ejected in the final minute when he was given two technical fouls. ""New York can get ready. They'll see 'em too. I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials but we deserve a fair shot.""

A frustrated Carlisle also implied the Pacers were being penalized by officials because they were playing against the league's largest market.

""Small-market teams deserve an equal shot"" Carlisle said. ""They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.""

Carlisle was ejected after growing upset about several calls in Game 2 particularly when officials correctly reversed a double-dribble violation that could have given the Pacers a key possession with the outcome still in doubt.

In Game 1 a kicked ball violation was called in error against the Pacers but not corrected a decision that ended up costing the team three vital points during the 121-117 loss.

The Madison Square Garden crowd which was elated when star Jalen Brunson returned in the second half after missing the entire second quarter to deal with a right foot issue made the environment hostile for the Pacers and Carlisle said he believed it affected the officiating to favor the Knicks.

The Pacers will have to examine their defensive film as well. After allowing the Knicks to shoot 65% in the second half in Game 1 as they lost a lead New York shot 67% in the third quarter of Game 2 and flipped the game outscoring Indiana 36-18 behind Brunson's return.

Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton who scored 34 points in bouncing back from putting up six in Game 1 wasn't going to put all the blame on the officiating.

""Let's not pretend like [officiating] is the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough"" Haliburton said. ""We just got to be better.""

One other issue for the Pacers to review as the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday (7 p.m. ET ESPN) is how to guard Brunson. Backup guard T.J. McConnell was somewhat effective in slowing Brunson in Games 1 and 2 but Carlisle took him out with seven minutes to play and the Knicks up two points replacing him with starter Andrew Nembhard.

Brunson scored 10 of his 29 points down the stretch with Nembhard as his primary defender and is 14-of-21 shooting for 33 points against Nembhard over the first two games according to ESPN Stats & Information. Carlisle said he considered bringing McConnell who had a +10 plus/minus on the night back in but decided against it because it wasn't how the team has played throughout the season.

McConnell supported his coach's decision.

""Rick is a Hall of Fame coach and has been doing this for a long time so the rotations that he plays we trust that they're the right ones and I fully support him"" McConnell said. ""Whenever my number is called I'll be ready.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL1RyYXZlbC9leGNsdXNpdmUtbW9tLXNwZWFrcy1hZnRlci1haXItZm9yY2UtcmVzY3VlZC1zb24vc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTEwMDYyOTIx0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvR01BL1RyYXZlbC9leGNsdXNpdmUtbW9tLXNwZWFrcy1hZnRlci1haXItZm9yY2UtcmVzY3VlZC1zb24vc3Rvcnk_aWQ9MTEwMDYyOTIx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Mom speaks out after Air Force rescued her son at sea from a cruise ship,"The ship was more than 350 nautical miles off the coast of North Carolina.

Angela Bridges was aboard the Carnival Venezia cruise ship with her family including son Aiden en route to New York City from the Caribbean when he fell seriously ill concerning the medical team on board.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News Bridges recalled the moment health professionals said ""'We're going to do an x-ray'"" and told her ""'it looks as though he has a perforation in his bowel -- the next thing that we need to do immediately is get him off the ship.""

At the time of the critical medical incident the ship was outside of North Carolina and more than 350 nautical miles off the coast.

The 920th Rescue Wing of the Air Force consisting of two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft and two teams of combat rescue officers and pararescuemen flew to the ship’s position to safely extract the patient for transport to the nearest capable medical center.

""We were standing there watching the whole time and I just you know screaming and crying over the helicopter blades"" Bridges recalled. ""It was very scary.""

""The amazing thing about this rescue is is actually how smooth it went. We went from zero notification to having aircraft ready to having aircraft in the air. And the young man in the hospital in in just a manner of hours"" Lt. Col. Dave Underwood told ABC News.

Other cruise-goers watched on as the rescue workers lowered down and grabbed the boy in critical condition followed by his mom.

A volatile weather pattern will fuel more rounds of damaging storms and tornadoes endangering lives and property in the southern United States through the end of the week.

Copied

From flooding in Illinois to destructive tornadoes in Tennessee severe storms left behind a path of destruction on May 8.

The risk of severe thunderstorms some capable of triggering tornadoes will reach across much of the southern United States as well as part of the mid-Atlantic region through Thursday AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

While the intensity of the thunderstorms may not be as ferocious as many that erupted in the Midwest and Great Plains earlier in the week there is still the likelihood that some of the strongest storms will be capable of producing a few tornadoes. Approximately 60 million people live within the anticipated zone of severe weather through Thursday night.

The tally of filtered severe weather incidents as reported by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) from Monday through Wednesday night had reached 936 of which there were 76 reports of tornadoes.

All it takes is one brief tornado to strike a populated area which leads to great risks to lives and property. And like most prior days this week there is the potential for multiple tornadoes to occur. With each passing day the storms have pushed into progressively more densely populated areas and that trend will continue prior to the end of the week.

A reported tornado wreaked havoc in a mobile home community in Portage Michigan on May 7.

""The main threats from the thunderstorms in the East will be high winds and hail"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.

A wedge of cool air will protect areas from Boston to New York City Philadelphia Baltimore and Pittsburgh areas from severe weather into Thursday night. Washington D.C. will be on the edge of the cool air influence. The cool air will occupy the lower part of the atmosphere so any thunderstorms and high winds will be forced to occur several thousand feet up and not at ground level.

The major metro areas and the airport hubs most likely to be affected by severe weather include Richmond Virginia; Charlotte; Columbia South Carolina; Atlanta; Birmingham Alabama; Jackson Mississippi; Shreveport Louisiana; and Dallas. As storms develop over or approach these areas and many regional secondary hubs ground stops can lead to lengthy airline delays and possible flight cancellations.

""It has been nearly a month since much of Virginia had severe storms"" Douty said ""April 15 was the last day with widespread wind and hail in the state and the mid-Atlantic region in general.""

Thursday will be an active day with severe weather from Virginia to Florida and Texas.

One cluster of thunderstorms leftover from storms that rocked the Tennessee Valley on Wednesday night will push southward through Alabama Georgia part of the Carolinas and northern Florida during the day on Thursday. These storms will pack strong wind gusts frequent lightning torrential downpours and some hail. A few of the strongest storms in this cluster could produce a tornado.

Forecasters are particularly concerned about a cluster of thunderstorms that will race eastward across the South on Thursday night. The main risk with these storms would be damaging winds. If confidence in this increases a ""high"" risk may be introduced for parts of the region later Thursday.

As the storms erupt downpours alone can lead to substantial travel delays. Motorists should be alert for changing weather conditions including rapidly rising water on some area streets highways and underpasses.

Severe storms to focus on southeastern corner of US on Friday

The likelihood of severe weather will continue to move southeastward on Friday. To close out the workweek for millions of Americans the severe weather will focus on an area from southern Alabama central Georgia and southern South Carolina to central Florida.

On Friday and Friday evening the main threats will be from storms packing high winds and hail. Some of the strongest storms may also trigger tornadoes or waterspouts.

If the overnight cluster of storms continues to move along the severe weather threat may end by midday in much of this zone except for perhaps central Florida.

People spending time on area beaches and the central Florida theme parks should be alert to rapidly changing weather conditions during the afternoon and evening.

As the Southeast region gets a break from thunderstorms from late Friday to the weekend a vigorous disturbance will drop southeastward across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast.

""This system is likely to produce some locally gusty thunderstorms with small hail but widespread damaging winds and hail are not likely"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.

The system will drop quickly across the Midwest from Friday to Saturday then slow down as it pivots across the Northeast on Saturday and Sunday where it is most likely to spoil many outdoor plans for Mother's Day weekend.

The small disturbance will mark a change in the weather pattern with massive multiday severe weather outbreaks taking an extended break over much of the Central states.

However trouble in the form of torrential downpours and drenching thunderstorms will set up along much of the Gulf Coast states especially in Texas and Louisiana from later in the weekend to the middle of next week. Enough rain may fall to renew flooding in Texas and trigger new flooding elsewhere in parts of the Interstate 10 corridor.

A Boeing 737 plane skidded off the runway at the airport in the Senegal capital Dakar injuring at least 10 people four of whom are in serious condition.

Some 85 people were onboard the plane that trundled off the runway onto the grass.

The Air Sénégal flight operated by TransAir was headed to Bamako late on Wednesday carrying 79 passengers two pilots and four cabin crew Transport Minister El Malick Ndiaye said in a statement on Thursday.

Flights have been suspended near Dakar since the incident authorities said.

The injured were being treated in a hospital while the other survivors were taken to a hotel. Footage shared on social media shows the wing of the plane covered in fire-suppressing foam.

The Dakar accident is the latest in a series of incidents plaguing Boeing's planes. It comes just one day after a Boeing cargo plane was forced to land on its nose in Istanbul after its front landing gear collapsed.

Earlier this year the US-based company decided to change its management following a mid-flight emergency door blowout on a 737 MAX plane in January."

E-learning has indeed seen a meteoric rise during the pandemic time as the population remained largely indoors and learning through the digital medium became their only choice.



To discuss the innovations creativity tools content creators are deploying to enhance learning outcomes the spectrum of consumers it covers and how education can be taken to the next level with the help of emerging tools like AR and VR various stakeholders of the Edtech industry joined the conversation.



Moderated by AnimationXpress India founder CEO & Editor-in-chief Anil Wanvari the webinar was participated by Vedanti Deputy General Manager New Initiatives Ajay Mittal Dexler Information Solutions Pvt Ltd Associate Vice President Content Development Aruna K Learning Mate Senior Vice President Prasad Mohare Eduisfun Technologies PVT LTD (STEPAPP) Chief Executive Officer and Founder Praveen Tyagi Upgrad President – Products & Technology Rohit Dhar Autodesk India & SAARC technical solutions – M&E Autodesk India & SAARC Samiti Shetty KUTUKI founder Sneha Sundaram and Edufic Digital Associate Vice President COE learning and development Tanmoy Sen.



The online education market is poised to go upto about 15 billion dollars between 2020 and 2024 progressing at an annual growth rate of about 21 per cent. According to a report by technaview there is going to be tremendous growth and the major growth which has come in the online education sector is from the content side. Content-based online education sector is anticipated to witness a gradual growth and will dominate the online education market between 2020 and 2024.



Throwing light on the learnings they’ve been able to glean in the pandemic in terms of creating content Sundaram shared “In terms of content strategy itself we haven’t changed too much mainly because the core of what we do still applies because we cater to preschoolers. It is super important that any content we create should not be based on instruction because kids don’t learn with authoritarian and instruction-based methodology. What works best for children is focused on the creative medium of content which is why our curriculum strongly focuses on stories and songs which are not intrusive and strong. More so now when young kids are alone at home and can’t meet friends that’s when stories and songs come in useful. In terms of our strategy we put young kids first keeping in mind their temperament and developmental stages that they go through at this stage. With learning companions like Kutuki how each child is interpreting our stories and applying their lives has been interesting for us.”

Aruna K points that she hasn’t seen a major change in the content strategy for the market they cater to; large enterprise customer wherein that is mandatory training that they have to go through but keeping content crisper and simpler has become more important because in this pandemic everyone is restricted to the four walls of their homes.



Sharing what his observations vis-a-vis the evolution of digital learning Ed-tech companies and content apps that Autodesk works together with Shetty shares “Story goes many years back. For me the content meant only textbooks. I am not a good reader but still we had to read and depend on textbooks whereas nowadays there are so many varieties visual content and creative ways to learn. It is definitely helping kids who are bent towards visual learning. I have been in touch with elearning companies. Kids have a lot of choices on content which is appealing and they can choose which content they want to go ahead with. Learning becomes faster. Content plays an important role. material is there but the task is how we put it into a visually appealing format to make the end user accept it. We need content for every age and every genre.”



Speaking about the upgradations they have brought along in the last 18 months Dhar shares “Lots of changes that have come in the last year. We had two apps for learning; which we recently combined in a single app for Upgrad. We have launched free courses within the app and we have also launched two minute bite-sized quick clips which we call shorts; “How to give an interview?” “How to read a book” etc. We have long-form courses like certification courses (6 months 3 months or Masters Degree) diploma and we have partnered with top universities. So we are going all out in terms of making partnerships with multiple platforms ecosystems educational institutions and experts. The intent is to holistically help a learner who is in search of a career.”



Sen shares that the pandemic has pushed more and more people towards digital learning. He shares “Primarily we have been in the space of creating digital content for custom learning organisations. Since we deal with B2B we get specific requests based on the audience and requirements and then we start working on the storyboarding. Pandemic has accelerated the process of shifting to digital learning. The query is that they want the learners to have a crisp short and straightforward content. We should create the content where people are getting engaged. Gamification is another way we can make it more interesting.”



Tyagi recounted that back in the times he knew within a minute whether the teacher entering the classroom would be able to teach him effectively or not. According to him the same is happening with Ed-tech companies; they are all trying to integrate technology but focus should lie in making education fun.



He shares “I believe education can be made fun. Stepapp is totally gamified. We focus on gamified format. Thousands of kendriya vidyalayas everywhere the feedback is amazing because we have broken down concepts into the smallest possible quantum granule and made it feel like a game rewards and points. For junior classes gamified stories whether a child wants to watch stories or access the internet.. I believe gamified stories are the way forward. Education must be interesting and it should be the next level. Solution is not just recording a classroom lecture it should be made more engaging through creative ways like gamification.”

Talking about how the content has evolved from the pedagogy perspective Mittal shares their focus has been on learning outcomes. “How do we personalise the learning outcomes for each child? We are investing in solutions which can homogenise the classrooms. We have been working hard in that direction. The uptick in the overall outcomes of the students is very encouraging. To evolve the content according to the new age; we are integrating simulations 3D etc. There is a thin line between gamifying the content and actually creating a game. Our assets are AR-enabled“ he shares.

Speaking about the post-pandemic impacts on their content strategy Mohare shares “While we don’t serve the Indian market it is absolutely great and encouraging to hear how the market is growing in India. My concern is the smaller institutions who are behind on the digital transformation curve and are on the verge of a shutdown due to the pandemic. This has been my concern because this situation has taught them that they need a plan B.

Pointing out two fundamental problems he has identified he noted “Issues we found were; how do I take my classroom content digital? Several institutions are still figuring that out. They are realising that zoomification is not the way and they are looking at new ways. User-centric design is fundamental to our process. Faculty and the digital literacy gap that they have; from having a marker and whiteboard today we have to teach a class in a different way.”

He also adds that blended learning flipped classroom model is one way of getting out of zoomified education. Building on the notion Tyagi points out that learning must be out of curiosity and it should be child centric and feedback driven and all our solutions should be created around that.”

Sundaram highlighted that pre-school education hasn’t had much innovation. She expounds “Either things are force-fed from the west. Very young children learn from what they know. When you expose them to things they are not familiar with. When they see characters they are not familiar with them it has an impact on their learning. I didn’t realise the depth of it. Formative years are so important in setting the context. Especially when you’re building content for India it is important to contextualise.”

Panelists agreed that while ROI (Return on Investment) is important since it also helps them determine how workable and effective their digital learning solutions are.

Outlining his vision for India’s education system Tyagi shared “My mission is that we create a level playing field in the country. In stepapp we don’t have a face of a teacher; at the moment we are selling it all across the world. The moment you gamify you have created a solution for the globe. I have taught many IIT students from rich and elite backgrounds but now I want education to reach all sections of society.”

Despite low levels of adoption the potential for digital technology to deliver significant improvements in efficiency build quality and worker safety is becoming increasingly understood by the region’s construction industry.

Combining data and analysis from MEED with industry feedback and transformation insights from Khatib & Alami Al Gurg Consultants and Hassan Allam Holding Digital Awakening provides a unique examination of the extent of digitalsation in the region's construction industry and a forward-looking assement of the areas of future digital investment.

In a poll of 50 GCC construction professionals conducted by MEED in the first quarter of 2021 100 per cent of respondents said that digital technology improves project delivery.

About 58 per cent of respondents said that digital transformation would have the biggest impact on overall project management and performance while 29 per cent felt that the most benefits would be seen in speed of delivery accuracy and collaboration.

But while there is widespread acceptance of the value of digital technology across the construction industry its deployment is uneven.

Asked to provide feedback on the extent of digitalisation of the construction industry in each of the GCC markets along with Egypt survey respondents reported that the UAE is leading the way in the region’s construction industry technology transformation.

This is perhaps unsurprising. Building information modelling (BIM) was first mandated by Dubai Municipality in 2013 and an increasing number of companies in the UAE are using drones to map survey and monitor construction projects.

In 2019 Dubai became the home to the world’s first 3D printed building.

Not far behind however is the region’s biggest construction market.

With some $1137bn of construction and transport projects planned or underway including a $298bn pipeline of future projects

Saudi Arabia accounts for about 45 per cent of the value of construction market in the GCC and Egypt.

And with high-profile projects such as Neom future-city Qiddiya entertainment city and the Red Sea Project being used to showcase the Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 agenda to transform the kingdom into a globally competitive technology hub Saudi Arabia is set to be a major driver of construction digitalisation in the region.

Gigaprojects

“The appetite for the use of digital techniques in the delivery of gigaprojects is high” says David Glennon digital delivery director at the Red Sea Development Company (TRSDC).

“These are ambitious projects that cannot be effectively delivered through traditional methods” says Glennon. “The time cost quality and sustainability improvements offered through digital ways of working at scale becomes a very compelling reason for change.”

With an eye to diversifying economies and positioning themselves on the world stage the UAE and Saudi Arabia have an incentive to promote digitalisation in their high-profile tourism developments.

In other markets however where economic development plans are focused more on traditional transport and infrastructure projects there is less appetite to explore new digital solutions.

Over 41 per cent of respondents to the MEED survey stated that they used BIM on less than 25 per cent of their projects in the region.

“The UAE is the early adopter of technology in the construction sector [in the GCC] but the others will follow” says Maged el-Hawary CIO at Dubai-based construction company ASGC. “This is the cycle of technology. You have leaders in adoption and the others follow at a later stage.”

In the cloud

Despite early concerns in the region about data security especially in government projects cloud computing is gaining traction.

The MEED survey shows that while BIM is the most widely adopted digital technology on construction projects in the GCC and Egypt cloud computing is now a close second.

“Since 2018 the market has improved” says El-Hawary “especially since Covid.”

This confirms the findings of a 2020 Trends Insight survey on construction technologies conducted by data analytics and research firm GlobalData which found that of all the technologies analysed cloud computing received the highest proportion of respondents confirming that they had already invested in this and had further investment planned within two years.

“Companies are starting to move from a capital expenditure model to an operational expenditure model” says El-Hawary.

“So instead of acquiring new technologies they use subscription services” he says.

He further explains that software as a service (SaaS) can deliver applications over the internet which is easier for a company than installing and maintaining their own software.

“Software as a service storage as a service infrastructure as a service is the easiest way and the most secure way to do this is to go to the cloud.”

Anas Bataw director at the Centre of Excellence in Smart Construction at Heriot-Watt University Dubai says that cloud-based technologies are the most important digital investment opportunities for companies today.

“They offer a host of benefits – flexibility security cost effectiveness mobility of use and are future-proof” says Bataw.

“Most importantly as this pandemic has shown us the economic damage caused by long-term lockdowns and reduced personnel on work sites means that the infrastructure that support remote working is critical and cloud-based technologies fulfil this need.”

In the UAE BIM has been used on a number of projects as far back as 2008 and by 2014 major projects such as Al-Maktoum International Airport Palm Jumeirah and Expo 2020 were mandating the use of BIM 3D later updated to BIM 4D.

In Saudi Arabia the use of BIM is also becoming more widespread.

“BIM been very successfully embedded at the Red Sea Development Company” says Glennon. “We have seen a shift to a ‘model first’ working practice which has allowed us to automate a number of tasks driving efficiency and data to improve decision making.”

“We are increasingly seeing this approach being adopted on other projects” he says.

Data revolution

Glennon says that data capture and data visualisation are growing areas of digitalisation in construction in the kingdom with the use of drones becoming common place.

He also says that Geographical Information Mapping is particularly strong in Saudi Arabia.

“There is a lot of high-quality local talent driving value from the tools” says Glennon. “This is a skillset that is important when working on projects of this scale and will continue to grow in importance as we create our first ‘digital twins’ in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”

Covid impact

Even before the Covid- 19 pandemic the digital transformation of construction was already well underway in the region. But the pandemic has accelerated the process.

Practices forced on companies during the global lockdown are demonstrating the power of technology to enable remote work and collaboration to streamline operations and to automate manual processes.

Companies that have not yet leveraged technology in their businesses are likely to fall behind.

“Digital transformation in the construction industry means that all construction companies are now under pressure to evolve and adapt or lose out” says Bataw. “And for the ones who have taken up the challenge they are realising several benefits such as increased operational efficiency lower costs improved coordination between project delivery teams and much more.”

To provide superior service to their customers and outdo the competition financial institutions are using the latest technologies to understand customer needs identify opportunities stay competitive solve business problems and streamline back office operations

The recent years have seen a rapid acceleration in the pace of disruptive technologies such as AI and Machine Learning in Finance due to improved software and hardware. The finance sector specifically has seen a steep rise in the use cases of machine learning applications to advance better outcomes for both consumers and businesses.

Machine Learning In Finance

Until recently only the hedge funds were the primary users of AI and ML in Finance but the last few years have seen the applications of ML spreading to various other areas including banks fintech regulators and insurance firms to name a few.

Right from speeding up the underwriting process portfolio composition and optimization model validation Robo-advising market impact analysis to offering alternative credit reporting methods the different use cases of AI and Machine Learning In Finance are having a significant impact on this sector.

The finance industry including the banks trading and fintech firms are rapidly deploying machine algorithms to automate time-consuming mundane processes and offering a far more streamlined and personalized customer experience.

How Does Machine Learning In Finance Work?

Machine Learning works by extracting meaningful insights from raw sets of data and provides accurate results. This information is then used to solve complex and data-rich problems that are critical to the banking & finance sector.

Further machine learning algorithms are equipped to learn from data processes and techniques used to find different insights.

Challenges Faced by Finance Companies While Implementing Machine Learning Solutions

While developing machine learning solutions financial services companies generally encounter some of the common problems as discussed below –

Lack of understanding about business KPIs Financial services companies want to exploit this great opportunity but owing to unrealistic expectations and lack of clarity on how AI and Machine Learning works (and why they need it) they often fail in this aspect.

The high cost of R&D Financial services companies often struggle with data management having fragmented chunks of data stored at different locations such as reporting software regional data hubs CRMs and so on. Getting this data ready for data science projects is both time consuming and an expensive task for companies. The combination of all such challenges results in unrealistic estimates and eats up the entire budget of the project. This is the reason why finance companies need to set realistic expectations for every machine learning services project depending on their specific business objectives.

Why Use Machine Learning in Finance?

Here are some of the reasons why banking and financial services firms should consider using Machine Learning despite having above-said challenges –

Enhanced revenues owing to better productivity and improved user experience

Low operational costs due to process automation

Reinforced security and better compliance

Machine Learning Use Cases in Finance

Here are a few use cases where machine learning algorithms can be/are being used in the finance sector –

Financial Monitoring

Machine learning algorithms can be used to enhance network security significantly. Data scientists are always working on training systems to detect flags such as money laundering techniques which can be prevented by financial monitoring. The future holds a high possibility of machine learning technologies powering the most advanced cybersecurity networks.

Making Investment Predictions

The fact that machine learning-enabled technologies give advanced market insights allows the fund managers to identify specific market changes much earlier as compared to the traditional investment models.

With renowned firms such as Bank of America JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley investing heavily in ML technologies to develop automated investment advisors the disruption in the investment banking industry is quite evident.

Process Automation

Machine Learning powered solutions allow finance companies to completely replace manual work by automating repetitive tasks through intelligent process automation for enhanced business productivity. Chatbots paperwork automation and employee training gamification are some of the examples of process automation in finance using machine learning. This enables finance companies to improve their customer experience reduce costs and scale up their services.

Further Machine Learning technology can easily access the data interpret behaviors follow and recognize the patterns. This could be readily used for customer support systems that can work similar to a real human and solve all of the customers’ unique queries.

An example of this is Wells Fargo using ML-driven chatbot through the Facebook Messenger to communicate with its users effectively. The chatbot helps customers get all the information they need regarding their accounts and passwords.

Secure Transactions

Machine Learning algorithms are excellent at detecting transactional frauds by analyzing millions of data points that tend to go unnoticed by humans. Further ML also reduces the number of false rejections and helps improve the precision of real-time approvals. These models are generally built on the client’s behavior on the internet and transaction history.

Apart from spotting fraudulent behavior with high accuracy ML-powered technology is also equipped to identify suspicious account behavior and prevent fraud in real-time instead of detecting them after the crime has already been committed.

According to a research for almost every $1 lost to fraud the recovery costs borne by financial institutions are close to $2.92.

One of the most successful applications of ML is credit card fraud detection. Banks are generally equipped with monitoring systems that are trained on historical payments data. Algorithm training validation and backtesting are based on vast datasets of credit card transaction data. ML-powered classification algorithms can easily label events as fraud versus non-fraud to stop fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Risk Management

Using machine learning techniques banks and financial institutions can significantly lower the risk levels by analyzing a massive volume of data sources. Unlike the traditional methods which are usually limited to essential information such as credit score ML can analyze significant volumes of personal information to reduce their risk.

Various insights gathered by machine learning technology also provide banking and financial services organizations with actionable intelligence to help them make subsequent decisions. An example of this could be machine learning programs tapping into different data sources for customers applying for loans and assigning risk scores to them. ML algorithms could then easily predict the customers who are at risk for defaulting on their loans to help companies rethink or adjust terms for each customer.

Algorithmic Trading

Machine Learning in trading is another excellent example of an effective use case in the finance industry. Algorithmic Trading (AT) has in fact become a dominant force in global financial markets.

ML-based solutions and models allow trading companies to make better trading decisions by closely monitoring the trade results and news in real-time to detect patterns that can enable stock prices to go up or down.

Machine learning algorithms can also analyze hundreds of data sources simultaneously giving the traders a distinct advantage over the market average. Some of the other benefits of Algorithm Trading include –

1.Increased accuracy and reduced chances of mistakes

2.AT allows trades to be executed at the best possible prices

3.Human errors are likely to be reduced substantially

4.Enables the automatic and simultaneous checking of multiple market conditions

Financial Advisory

There are various budget management apps powered by machine learning which can offer customers the benefit of highly specialized and targeted financial advice and guidance. Machine Learning algorithms not only allow customers to track their spending on a daily basis using these apps but also help them analyze this data to identify their spending patterns followed by identifying the areas where they can save.

One of the other rapidly emerging trends in this context is Robo-advisors. Working like regular advisors they specifically target investors with limited resources (individuals and small to medium-sized businesses) who wish to manage their funds. These ML-based Robo-advisors can apply traditional data processing techniques to create financial portfolios and solutions such as trading investments retirement plans etc. for their users.

Customer Data Management

When it comes to banks and financial institutions data is the most crucial resource making efficient data management central to the growth and success of the business.

The massive volume and structural diversity of financial data from mobile communications social media activity to transactional details and market data make it a big challenge even for financial specialists to process it manually.

Integrating machine learning techniques to manage such large volumes of data can bring both process efficiency and the benefit of extracting real intelligence from data. AI and ML tools such as data analytics data mining and natural language processing help to get valuable insights from data for better business profitability.

An excellent example of this could be machine learning algorithms used for analyzing the influence of market developments and specific financial trends from the financial data of the customers.

Decision-Making

Banking and financial institutions can use Machine Learning algorithms to analyze both structured and unstructured data. E.g. customer requests social media interactions and various business processes internal to the company and discover trends (both useful and potentially dangerous) to assess risk and help customers make informed decisions accurately.

Customer Service Level Improvement

Using an intelligent chatbot customers can get all their queries resolved in terms of finding out their monthly expenses loan eligibility affordable insurance plan and much more.

Further there are several ML-based applications which when connected to a payment system can analyze accounts and let customers save and grow their money. Sophisticated ML algorithms can be used to analyze user behavior and develop customized offers. For example a customer looking to invest in a financial plan can be benefitted from a personalized investment offer after the ML algorithm analyses his/her existing financial situation.

Customer Retention Program

Credit card companies can use ML technology to predict at-risk customers and specifically retain selected ones out of these. Based on user demographic data and transaction activity they can easily predict user behavior and design offers specifically for these customers.

The application here includes a predictive binary classification model to find out the customers at risk followed by utilizing a recommender model to determine best-suited card offers that can help to retain these customers.

Marketing

The ability of AI and Machine Learning models to make accurate predictions based on past behavior makes them a great marketing tool. From analyzing the mobile app usage web activity and responses to previous ad campaigns machine learning algorithms can help to create a robust marketing strategy for finance companies.

Future Prospects of Machine Learning In Finance

While some of the applications of machine learning in banking & finance are clearly known and visible such as chatbots and mobile banking apps the ML algorithms and technology are now being gradually used for innovative future applications as well by drawing out historical data of customers accurately and predicting their future.

Apart from the established use cases of machine learning in finance as discussed in the above section there are several other promising applications that ML technology can offer in the future. While few of these have relatively active applications today others are still at a nascent stage.

Recommendations or Sales of Different Financial Products

Although there are various applications of automated financial product sales/recommendations existing even today some of them involve rule-based systems (instead of machine learning) where data still goes through manual resources to be able to recommend trades or investments to customers.

The future will see ML and AI technologies being actively used by insurance recommendation sites to suggest customers a particular home or vehicle insurance policy. Further an interesting trend to watch in the future would be Robo-advisors suggesting changes in portfolios and a rapid rise of ML-based personalized apps and personal assistants offering more objective and reliable advisory services to the customers.

Enhanced Security

Data security in banking & finance is a critically important area. With all the information available online organizations find it increasingly challenging to keep all the usernames passwords and security questions safe. The next few years will see a dramatic shift in this area where passwords usernames and security questions may no longer be the norm for user security.

Taking the security a notch higher machine learning applications will transform future security within the industry with adoption of voice recognition facial recognition or other similar biometric data.

Adyen Payoneer Paypal Stripe and Skrill happen to some of the companies that have invested heavily in security machine learning.

Customer Sentiment Analysis

Machine learning models can be of great help to finance companies when it comes to analyzing current market trends predicting the changes and social media usage for every customer.

Because human factors primarily drive the stock market businesses need to learn from the financial activity of users continuously. Further consumer sentiment analysis can also complement current information on different types of commercial and economic developments.

Better Customer Service

An increasing number of financial institutions are now prioritizing customer engagement for obvious reasons. Apart from helping them improve retention rates it also helps them understand user behavior and their changing concerns and needs. An excellent example of this is the chatbots used for instant communication with the customer.

The future is going to see these chat assistants being built with an abundance of finance-specific customer interaction tools and robust natural language processing engines to allow for swift interaction and querying.

While this kind of specialized chatbot experience is not the norm today in the banking or finance industry it holds great potential for the future. This is one application that goes beyond just machine learning in finance and is likely to be seen in a variety of other fields and industries.

Machine Learning in Finance – What’s Next?

Machine Learning today plays a crucial role in different aspects of the financial ecosystem from managing assets assessing risks providing investment advice dealing with fraud in finance document authentication and much more.

While ML algorithms are dealing with a myriad of tasks they are constantly learning from the volumes of data and bridging the gap by bringing the world closer to a completely automated financial system.

For most of the financial companies the need is to start with identifying the right set of use cases with an experienced machine learning services partner who can develop and implement the right models by focusing on specific data and business domain after thorough understanding of the expected output that is going to be extracted from different sources transform it and get the desired results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tdXNlLXRyYW5zZm9ybWVyLW5ldHdvcmtzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWEtZm9yZWNhc3RpbmctbW9kZWwtMjk3ZjkyNzBlNjMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to use Transformer Networks to build a Forecasting model,"I recently read a really interesting paper called Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza Prevalence Case. I thought it might be an interesting project to implement something similar from scratch to learn more about time series forecasting.

The Forecasting Task:

In time series forecasting the objective is to predict future values of a time series given its historical values. Some examples of time series forecasting tasks are:

We can for example store the energy consumption measures of a city for a few months and then train a model that will be able to predict the energy consumption of the city in the future. This can be used to estimate energy demand and thus energy companies can use this model to estimate the optimal value of the energy that needs to be produced at any given time.

Example of time series forecasting

The Model:

The model we will use is an encoder-decoder Transformer where the encoder part takes as input the history of the time series while the decoder part predicts the future values in an auto-regressive fashion.

The decoder is linked with the encoder using an attention mechanism. This way the decoder can learn to “attend” to the most useful part of the time series historical values before making a prediction.

The decoder uses masked self-attention so that the network can’t cheat during train by looking ahead and using future values to predict past values.

The encoder Sub-Network:

Encoder / Image by author

The decoder Sub-Network:

Decoder / Image by author

The full model:

Auto-regressive Encoder-Decoder Transformer / Image by author

This architecture can be constructed using PyTorch using the following:

encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(

d_model=channels

nhead=8

dropout=self.dropout

dim_feedforward=4 * channels

)

decoder_layer = nn.TransformerDecoderLayer(

d_model=channels

nhead=8

dropout=self.dropout

dim_feedforward=4 * channels

)



self.encoder = torch.nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer num_layers=8)

self.decoder = torch.nn.TransformerDecoder(decoder_layer num_layers=8)

The data:

Every time I implement a new approach I like to try it first on synthetic data so that it's easier to understand and debug. This reduces the complexity of the data and focuses more on the implementation/Algorithm.

I wrote a small script that can generate non-trivial time series with different periodicity offsets and patterns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIwMzgxMDMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parameterizing the Yellow River Delta tidal creek morphology using automated extraction from remote sensing images,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720381031 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDQ4OTY5NzIwMzgxMDMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9oeXBlcnBhcmFtZXRlci10dW5pbmctaW4tbGFzc28tYW5kLXJpZGdlLXJlZ3Jlc3Npb25zLTcwYTRiMTU4YWU2ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyperparameters in Lasso and Ridge,In this post we are first going to have a look at some common mistakes when it comes to Lasso and Ridge regressions and then I’ll describe the steps I usually take to tune the hyperparameters.

While CODEPINK has an ongoing campaign urging BlackRock to divest from all weapon manufacturers this year we also ask that BlackRock support human rights for this shareholder season.

WHEN: Sunday May 16th at 3PM EST

WHERE: Zoom

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager controlling more than $5 trillion in assets globally. BlackRock released a statement indicating that it would like companies to implement and disclose their human rights processes to identify manage and prevent adverse human rights impacts. But yet BlackRock is one of the largest shareholders of Tasers manufacturer Axon enterprise and has $7.25 billion invested in Boeing $3.3 billion in General Dynamics $5.6 billion in Lockheed Martin $3.4 billion in Northrop Grumman and $4 billion in Raytheon. Weapons made by these companies are being used in Palestine Syria Iraq Yemen and other places around the world where the US continues to be involved in active conflicts. As you can see even though BlackRock said it would like companies to implement human rights processes they continue to profit from war. BlackRock even has an iShares fund that exclusively benefits from weapons of war.

At this planning meeting for the upcoming May 25th protest of the BlackRock Shareholders meeting we’ll update everyone on some working plans including introducing our speakers and musicians as well as thinking through run-of-day logistics and roles for the day of the protest.

Please RSVP to receive the Zoom link.

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

Wednesday's opening celebrates the redevelopment of the former YMCA building on the corner of Summer and Front streets.

This construction project will add 50 new units to the development for a total of 60 apartments 42 of them considered affordable.

Also read:

The complex is for seniors and the units range in price from $800 to $1500 depending on the income of the tenant.

This project is owned and operated by the Szanton Company and Bath Housing is celebrating their work saying Bath is no exception to the state's housing crisis.

“We see a lot of people come through our office that are rent-burdened” Bath Housing Executive Director Debora Keller said. “They are paying 60 70 80 percent of their rent their income for rent and a project like this which aligns your rent to your income levels is really valuable and gives people the cushion they need to thrive as they get older.”

The property manager of the Bath development says the building is at 100 percent pre-occupancy and the company is excited to welcome in those tenants Wednesday."

Maybe Entrepreneurs Can.,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Warren Buffett recently described the American healthcare system as a ""tapeworm in the American economy."" Berkshire Hathaway JPMorgan Chase and Amazon formed Haven to disrupt the healthcare industry — which is 17 percent of GDP — and as Buffett put it ""the tapeworm won.""

One might assume that since three of the largest and most successful companies in the country couldn't create a more efficient healthcare system it can't be done. The truth is that Haven made some key missteps which now highlight the path for entrepreneurs who want to create a more affordable and accessible healthcare system.

Staffing snafu

Haven hired a CEO who was a brilliant physician and academic but who had limited experience in how healthcare administration works. It built a team around him of 57 academics clinicians and insurance veterans. It needed streetfighters.

At first things looked good. There was a public fight over a noncompete with UnitedHealthcare. That gave the healthcare market hope that maybe if one of the industry giants was so concerned about its trade secrets Haven would use the knowledge of how the system works to change it. That did not happen.

Partnership problems

Amazon which seemingly dominates any industry it wants was unable to break into the pharmacy business on its own terms because it could not get referrals or data from the major health plans all of which own pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). So Amazon agreed to a relationship that was patently undisruptive: a partnership with a PBM to create a mail-order pharmacy.

Amazon built its new pharmacy business on one of the most broken aspects of the healthcare industry which was guaranteed to undermine Haven. This is only the most overt example of the Haven companies relying on the industry they hoped to change.

Tapeworm tangle

The healthcare industry is so big that all of the Fortune 50 have a stake in the current healthcare system beyond their employee benefits. JPMorgan Chase and other large banks sell profitable growing healthcare companies that are benefiting from the broken system. Berkshire Hathaway has a longstanding reinsurance business that benefits from the prepayment of premiums to leverage its investment strategies.

What would Warren Buffett do?

Look no further than Warren Buffett's own investment strategy for a roadmap to fixing the healthcare system. Buffett has never been the moonshot guy. He's methodical. Loudly creating a venture to disrupt an entire industry isn't really his style. Incremental improvement is.

The changes needed in healthcare are small and many. And like Buffett's fortune their cumulative effect can be massive. A much-needed update to the formulary and rebate system can lower drug costs. Technology can ensure that patients pay the lowest possible price at the pharmacy. Not just auditing for billing errors but preventing them could save billions of dollars.

Dozens of changes like these can return money to employers and individuals without changing the quality of care or health outcomes in any way. Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway did find inefficiencies and lowered its own healthcare costs some. Good for him — he was on the right track but didn't have the proper team or structure to keep going.

Haven certainly had the potential to upend the systems that prevent competition in the current environment but it seems it simply wasn't channeled properly. The giants had their chance. Now it's up to startups and entrepreneurs to not waste this opportunity.

SINGAPORE May 15 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZEXPRWIRE Humans have never stopped expanding their consciousness and sphere of exploration. We are composing a new chapter in the web3.0 paradigm for mass adoption with sustainable technologies.

About Bit.Country

Bit.Country enables everyone to start their own metaverse with token economy and NFT and takes community engagement to a new dimension on web3.0.

In each bit country there is a local social token backed by our native token $NUUM the local marketplace and the local DAO that governs the community and makes decisions for issues such as the supply of assets.

We are also transitioning social engagement to a 3D virtual world while still allowing access to the classical web social timelines with text and multimedia.

Our Purpose

While our team is excited about web3.0 development our destiny is to create a network that brings real world impact. We want to provide ordinary people with opportunities of value access in this paradigm shift.

Our vision and dream comes true when the common people of the world are able to earn a modest income by contributing to their Bit.Country communities; and Bit.Country owners distribute value to their followers by generating greater influence through network expansion.

Our Approach

Education is the door to many great things as founding members of Industry Connect a well-known global tech educator our proven strength is to educate people for success.

We have launched several courses to bring people to benefit from the Web3.0 movement. Those are the Substrate Runtime Developer Academy (partnered with Acala Network) and the world's first Metaverse Career Academy .

Education will allow us to bring awareness to this new paradigm while growing an elite community for the metaverse future. More

The Inception

In early 2018 Ray Lu our Co-founder & CEO while attending the US-China blockchain conference in San Francisco visualized a future digital world for virtual assets and virtual life. Making it meaningful and real through trustless value which is a strong link between the metaverse and reality. He bought the domain name bit.country right on the spot and started imagining a new venture.

Since then his team Justin Shannon and Daniel with their master-apprentice culture started the proof of concept.

Henley previously played in a band called Shiloh — and Kenny Rogers played a critical role in introducing his talents to the world.

Shiloh were an up-and-coming band that played around the music scene in Texas and they met Rogers in 1968 in a chance encounter in a clothing store in Dallas that all of the cool local musicians hung out at. Rogers' country solo career was still years away but he was already a star as the lead singer and bass player in the First Edition who scored a string of late-'60s and early-'70s hits including ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"" ""Ruby Don't Take Your Love to Town"" ""Something's Burning' and more.

According to legend the then-21-year-old Henley approached Rogers and convinced him to come to Shiloh's club gig that night though Rogers initially protested that he wasn't really interested. He ended up liking their set so much that he brought them out to Los Angeles where they lived at his house for four months while they recorded a self-titled album that Rogers produced for Amos Records.

Though the album is not as focused as Henley's future work there are undeniable flashes of the cynical wit that would underlie some of his later songs and his one-of-a-kind voice is already in evidence on those early recordings as is the sparse drumming style that would become part of the Eagles' signature sound:

Released in 1970 the album was not successful and Shiloh disbanded in 1971. Henley had already met another struggling young musician named Glenn Frey who was signed to the same record company as part of a duo called Longbranch Pennywhistle and after that situation also fell apart Linda Ronstadt's manager recruited both of them to play in her new backing band along with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner. They split off to form the Eagles in 1971 and that group went on to become one of the most dominant musical forces of the decade.

Henley and Rogers remained close friends until Rogers' death in March of 2020 and Henley opened up to Billboard about his late friend in a statement the following day saying ""In addition to his tremendous talent Kenny was a generous and caring man a wise mentor to so many of us. He loved his friends his family his fellow musicians and his fans and they loved him right back.""

""Fifty years ago The Gambler took a gamble on me and my first band from small-town Texas and his big-hearted support launched many careers including mine"" Henley adds. ""He also gave me some of the best career advice I ever got: 'You’d better be nice to the people you meet on the way up because you’re going to meet those same people on the way back down.'""

He got to see Rogers one final time just weeks before his death.

""I’m just grateful that I got to visit with him in the hospital about six weeks ago and convey my gratitude to him for all he did for me. RIP my friend. Thanks for all the gladness you gave us"" Henley's statement concluded.

Be sure to check out the latest installments to follow the renovation process from start to finish.

I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I bought an induction stovetop as part of my recent kitchen renovation. But it turns out there are a couple of things I wish I understood about the magnetic appliance technology beforehand.

While the renovation revolved around turning the outdated space into a DIY smart home  I skipped on smart kitchen appliances with smart displays and voice assistants built-in. Still I wanted my space to feature future-ready fixtures. That’s when I decided to purchase an energy-efficient induction stove that quickly heats up cookware using a magnetic field.

An alternative to the best gas ranges and best electric ranges  induction stoves solve common safety and climate concerns. Not only do induction stoves turn off automatically when cookware isn’t detected but they’re more energy efficient compared to other smooth-top electric units. And induction ranges use electricity rather than natural gas which makes them better for the environment. Research shows that induction cooktops are 84% energy efficient while gas tops are only 40% energy efficient.

These swaps used to come at much higher cost but nowadays induction stovetops are more affordable. This 30-inch Frigidaire range fell just within our budget. But even though I’m a self-proclaimed kitchen whiz I realized I’d needed to do some research about how to use and care for my stove before whipping up delicious dishes.

How does induction cooking work?

The flow of an alternating current (AC) creates an electromagnetic field on an induction stovetop that excites the molecules in pots and pans that aren’t good conductors like iron or steel. When these metal molecules are excited they heat up quickly. They also cool down quickly.

You won’t see the stovetop glow red like you might a standard electric stovetop. And when the molecular connection between cookware and the stovetop is broken heat stops being produced.

Now that’s how induction cooking works. Here are 5 other things I think you should know if you’re considering an induction stove for your own home.

1. You’ll need induction cookware — how to check whether a pot or pan will work

Perhaps the most pesky thing about an induction stovetop is that it requires particular cookware to work properly. Originally I thought ferromagnetic cookware (stainless steel or iron) was optional. I learned the hard way it’s not when I scalded a small aluminum wok I recently bought at Costco.

With the wok in the trash can I picked up a set of Cuisinart stainless steel cookware that clearly advertised its induction-ready. If you don’t know whether your existing cookware will work there’s a neat trick: Hold a fridge magnet to the back of the pan. If it sticks it’s compatible with an induction stove.

2. You might need to change your techniques

Cooking with induction takes some getting used to especially if you’re accustomed to cooking over coils. My old stove suffered from slow and irregular heating which my kitchen rhythms accommodated. But with induction there’s no more turning around to chop vegetables while oil warms up. It’s ready to saute onions in seconds meaning I’ve had to practice more mise en place.

Similarly I’ve had to change how I handle a pan while making sauces. I used to lift and shimmy cookware over a gas flame to combine my ingredients over regular heat (whether this was necessary or my own flair I can’t say) but this doesn’t work with induction. When you lift your pan up the magnetic cooktop will sense its absence and cut the power. While I might not look as cool while cooking anymore induction is definitely safer for this reason. I’ll admit I’ve forgotten to turn off a burner before.

3. You’ll never boil water the same way

Pasta is my favorite food. Seriously I make it multiple times per week. Which means I’ve spent more time of my life than I’d like waiting for water to boil. (Of course I’ve found ways to fill that time whether it’s fixing a cocktail or prepping my signature pink sauce.)

With the power setting on my new induction cooktop my well-salted water goes from cold to bubbling in five minutes give or take. The time saved is a game-changer. And in the case I do need to step away or forget I have water boiling the induction stove will turn off if it senses overflowed liquids spilling on its surface.

4. You won’t be able to char food easily

One cooking feature I wish induction cooking offered is the ability to char ingredients. On my old gas range I could crisp up peppers or get a quick toast on a tortilla. Fajitas are a regular dinner in my household and I’ve found myself missing certain textures I can’t achieve directly on induction.

That said you could order an induction-compatible griddle or use your trusty cast iron pan. In the past I’ve reserved my cast iron pans for special occasions specifically those when I know I have the time to clean cast iron. I’m using them more frequently now although it’d still be faster and easier to toast certain foods right on the grate.

5. You’ll need to know induction cooktop maintaince

As simple and safe as an induction stovetop makes cooking at home you’ll need to take care of it for it to work as well for a long period of time. One thing to be mindful of with each use is to place and pick up pans gently. If the ceramic gets heavily scratched it could dull the strength of the magnetic field.

Scratches and scuffs also attract food deposits which can harden and also hinder the efficiency of your induction stove. This cooktop cleaner is effective for long-term care while regular cleaning with a damp rag is also encouraged.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcmV2aWV3ZWQudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL2NhbmFkYS9sYXVuZHJ5L2ZlYXR1cmVzLzUtdG9wLWxvYWQtYWdpdGF0b3Itd2FzaGVycy15b3UtY2FuLWJ1eS1jYW5hZGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 top-load agitator washers you can buy in Canada - Reviewed Canada,"Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.

There’s no getting around the fact that top-load washers don’t perform as well as front loaders. Our test have confirmed that front-loaders offer better energy and water efficiency and generally clean clothes better than top-loaders. Still there's something comforting about doing household chores the same way you saw them done while growing up.

Fortunately time hasn’t stood still for pole-agitator models. Many use the top loader's time-tested design and improved on it with the addition of modern improvements such as stainless steel wash tubs soft-close hinges and dual-action agitators. What's more high-efficiency front-load washers though newer still have issues with odour build-up and loud vibrations.

These are the best top-load agitator washers you can buy in Canada.

1. Whirlpool WTW8127LC

If you want a washer that is easy to use provides a good clean and has a pole agitator the Whirlpool WTW8127LC is a solid choice.

This washer has three unique features that set it apart from the rest of the pack. First it has a removable agitator for when you need extra space or a more gentle wash cycle. All you need to do is squeeze the handle on top of the agitator and the whole pole pops out. This top-loader also comes with a built-in pretreating station—there is a faucet that can dispense hot and cold water and a specialized brush for scrubbing stubborn stains. Finally instead of having vague cycle names the WTW8127LC has the “What to Wash / How to Wash” system. Knowing exactly what your washer is doing to your clothes helps cut down on confusion and frustration when it comes to doing laundry.

We think a washer that has a pole agitator a washer plate and a utility sink is worth checking out.

2. LG WT7305CV

Laundry purists may stand behind a traditional washing machine design—a top loader with a pole agitator—such as the new LG WT7305CV but those who can also geek out on special smart features will love this modern machine.

The WT7305CV comes outfitted with LG's ThinQ app which lets you control the washer remotely and through LG's ProActive Care program it uses AI and wifi to send LG usage diagnostics and appliance problems. It also has some other great features that actually add functionality like its soft-close lid and a deep fill feature which is great for users who get their clothes really really dirty.

When it comes to cleaning power the WT7305CV holds its own but we would've liked to see a bit more stain-fighting power from a washer in this price range. That being said the WT7305CV is more than capable of handling the average load of laundry—just be careful around red wine and chocolate.

The Maytag MVW7230HW top-loader carries a premium price but if you can get it on sale it offers some decent performance for a traditional top-loader.

4. Maytag MVWC465HW

The made-in-America Maytag MVWC465HW washer is perfect for people who want a traditional white top-load washing machine with an old-school pole agitator.

The PowerWash cycle does a good job removing stains but its cycle time is a bit long clocking in at an hour and 24 minutes. You can try the normal cycle which has a shorter run time of 47 minutes but your clothes might not get as clean.

This machine lets you add more water to a cycle with the ""Deep Water Wash"" option and the ""Deep Rinse"" option sprays water on the wash drum itself cleaning the washer of leftover detergent and stain residue which means you're not transferring dirt from one load of laundry to another. We think this washer will work well for a smaller cleaner family.

5. Maytag MVWC565FW

The Maytag MVWC565FW washer is a good value—less expensive than its sibling the Maytag MVWB765FW but similar in important ways. The spacious 4.9-cu.-ft. tub lets you do a lot of laundry at once and the central corkscrew agitator and lengthy PowerWash cycle work together to produce very clean clothes.

This model also includes a Wrinkle Control cycle (basically a Delicate cycle with warm water) that purports to help clean and mitigate wrinkles on fabrics that might be more difficult to iron like sports jerseys or clothes made with blended fabrics.

This washer’s five knob interface won’t win any design awards but whether you’re a laundry expert or you’ve never done a load before you’ll find every control easy to use. The temperature settings are numerous you can choose a deep water level for really dirty clothes and with a turn of the dial select whether you want one rinse or two.

A small lightweight pump is great for carrying when you ride but a track pump is the best tool for the job when you're at home. We've inflated hundreds of tyres over the years to find out which track pumps do the job best. These are the best track pumps you can buy.

A track pump makes it easy to keep your tyres at the right pressure keeping them performing at their best. They start at just £10 so there's no need to struggle with a hand pump every time your tyres need topping up.

Pay attention Bond: it's easy to over-inflate a tyre by using a track pump absent-mindedly so keep an eye on the gauge.

Smaller riders should go for narrow-barrel floor pumps to get the right pressure; we've seen diminutive riders lift themselves off the floor with some fatter pump.

Great performance and build quality from a home workshop favourite. The construction is all-steel with the pressed base bolted to the barrel. The Sport uses Topeak's TwinHead adapter with Presta and Schrader valves sitting opposite each other and sharing a locking lever. It's a simple design that's simple to use. Both sides of the head accepted all the valves we tried with no leaks.

If your fleet includes lots of different tyres sizes and tubeless systems too this is the track pump you want. The Topeak JoeBlow Tubi 2Stage features the new TubiHead valve coupler and it's a revelation for anyone using tubeless tyres. The two-stage chambers save time and effort when inflating tyres too.

With track pumps there's usually a compromise to be made; get something capable of getting the skinny rubber up to 160psi and have it take forever on big tyres or choose one that pumps large amounts of air per stroke – but struggles to reach high pressures. Topeak has overcome the whole volume vs pressure issue here by using two barrels and adding a switch at the top of the pump.

If you're running tubeless the TubiHead can remove valve cores while keeping air in the tyre. This is a revelation for tubeless tyre users. Removing the valve allows you to get far more air into the tyre more quickly and keeping the pressure up while you replace the core means the tyre stays seated. Genius!

The classic pro workshop pump has its deficiencies — the gauge is relatively small and being at the bottom of the shaft is awkward to read — but it's tough as old boots which explains its enduring popularity. The base is made from cast metal the shaft is a hefty steel tube and the comfy handle is nicely turned from wood. The construction quality makes it highly resistant to the kind of everyday knocks and bumps that a floor pump has to endure in a pro workshop.

It's available with a selection of heads from a fits-everything 'smart' head to a simple push-on Presta-only attachment.

For just a tenner this inexpensive pump from Wiggle's own-brand Lifeline is a major bargain. It has a dual-valve head that fits both presta and Schrader valves and the gauge is at the top of the barrel so it's easy to read.

The Beto CJA-001S Tubeless Air Tank Inflator is a workshop-quality tubeless air tank with well-thought-out features and excellent performance. It should last you a lifetime of tubeless setup road or mountain.

Topeak's Joe Blow Booster is an easy to use all in one solution for anyone that wants to seat tricky tubeless tyres or just inflate them using a high-pressure reservoir to provide enough of a blast of air to get even the most stubborn rubber seated. It's expensive but it's the best all-in-one unit we've used by some way.

If you regularly inflate tubeless tyres and need a quality track pump anyway it makes a lot of sense to plump for this. Even if you've already got a decent track pump the ease of use makes it highly tempting too.

Most cyclists have a couple of pumps: a mini pump for road-side rescue and a track pump for home inflation. The cycling industry is nothing if not adept at creating niches however and the travelling track pump might be just such a niche - for when you're on a biking holiday or just need to cram a lot of stuff in a small car for an event. Cannondale's Airport Carry On floor pump is just such a pump with a capacity equal to many a full-sized track pump and a clever folding design to make it more packable.

Silca makes super-high-quality tools and accessories with the associated high prices. The Superpista Digital Floor Pump is the most expensive track pump we've ever tested (and probably the second most expensive track pump ever made) but it is extremely nice to use with a solid build quality.

Zefal's Profil Max FP60 is a decent floor pump and doesn't cost the earth. It's pretty well-made and is a pleasure to use. It looks like it'll go the distance and if the head wears out then replacement is available. The long hose Z-switch head big dial and smooth pumping action make it a pleasure to use and it gets tyres to 120psi with ease.

Everything you need to know about track pumps

It doesn’t need to be especially portable so unlike most things in cycling the weight of a track pump isn’t an issue. Instead you want something that’s solidly built so it’ll last you years.

What features should you look for in a track pump?

Base

The base needs to be stable so wide is good. You usually put a foot on either side of the base to hold the pump steady. If you’re likely to use your pump on polished floors inside your house or flat check for non-slip rubber contact points that won’t cause scratches.

Gauge

One of the advantages of a track pump is that you get a gauge that allows you to inflate your tyres to the correct pressure (some hand-held pumps have gauges but most don’t). Some are digital but most are dials.

The ability to set a marker to show your target pressure is handy. Some people prefer a gauge positioned at the top of the barrel rather than at the bottom for easier reading. A gauge at the top can be damaged if the pump gets knocked over so needs to be well protected. The important thing is that you can see it clearly wherever it is.

Barrel

The barrel – the main body of the pump – can be made of various different materials. Because weight isn’t usually an issue strong steel and aluminium are good options. The larger the barrel the more air you can pump into your inner tubes with every stroke.

As well as getting your tyres pumped up more quickly a large barrel will allow you to seat tyre beads in tubeless tyre systems but beware if you're a very small rider: you might struggle to get higher pressures into your tyres with an oversized barrel.

Valve head/chuck

Most track pumps are suitable for both Presta (road type) and Schrader (car type) valves. Some have a dual head with different holes for different valves some have a single hole that works with both some have a chuck that you turn around according to the valve type. Sometimes you have to unscrew a cap and flip over a bung to swap between valves. That’s not a problem if you use the same type of valve all the time but it’s a bit of a pain if you use both.

If anything is going to fail on your track pump over time it’s likely to be the valve head so it’s a good idea to check that you can buy spares separately to save you buying a whole new pump.

Bleed valve

A bleed valve is a handy feature if you want to be very precise with the air pressure in your inner tubes. It allows you to let a little air out without removing the valve head from the valve.

Piston

The piston is the rod underneath the handle that forces air out of the barrel and into your tyres. Some pistons can be flexy meaning that you have to pump carefully to avoid destroying the whole pump. Go for something as sturdy as possible.

Handle

Handles come in a variety of different materials. Choose a handle that’s comfortable to use and again go for something sturdy that’ll stand the test of time.

Hose

A long hose – one that stretches the full length of the barrel and back again – can make life slightly easier although it’s unlikely to be a deal breaker.

Tubeless air tank

The growing popularity of tubeless tyres has led to a new pump category with an extra chamber that provides a big burst of air to get a tubeless tyre seated. You pressurise the tank and then release all the air into the tyre in one hit blowing the tyre bead up on to the rim seat.

Weight and portability

The weight of your track pump probably isn’t much of an issue for you because it’s likely to live most if not all its life in your house or garage. You might want something relatively small and lightweight if you’re likely to take it with you when you travel to events/races particularly if you’re flying.

Pressure

Check that the pump is capable of getting your tyres up to the pressure you need. The chances are that it will be but bear in mind that some tubulars require very high pressures and some manufacturers exaggerate their pumps’ capabilities.

Looks

It used to be that track pumps were purely functional (or ‘boring’ depending on your point of view). Now you can get ones with polished steel or anodised aluminium barrels wooden handles and so on. They actually look cool.

Why pay more?

Pretty much every track pump out there will get enough air into your tyres relatively easily so why not just buy the cheapest you can find and be done with it?

Well pay extra and you're likely to get something made from better quality materials so it'll probably be more robust and last longer. If you only cycle rarely that might not be much of an issue but if you're a year-round cyclist perhaps with several bikes to keep on the road a better pump is more of an asset.

Plus paying for a decent pump with a good head that locks firmly in place on the valve without leaking or working loose is definitely worth having. It makes life that little bit easier.

If you want a pump that's shiny and/or anodized with a wooden handle and a cool-looking gauge it'll cost you more than a basic plastic pump but you might not be interested in how the pump looks especially if it's going to spend its whole life in the shed or garage.

While CODEPINK has an ongoing campaign urging BlackRock to divest from all weapon manufacturers this year we also ask that BlackRock support human rights for this shareholder season.

WHEN: Sunday May 16th at 3PM EST

WHERE: Zoom

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager controlling more than $5 trillion in assets globally. BlackRock released a statement indicating that it would like companies to implement and disclose their human rights processes to identify manage and prevent adverse human rights impacts. But yet BlackRock is one of the largest shareholders of Tasers manufacturer Axon enterprise and has $7.25 billion invested in Boeing $3.3 billion in General Dynamics $5.6 billion in Lockheed Martin $3.4 billion in Northrop Grumman and $4 billion in Raytheon. Weapons made by these companies are being used in Palestine Syria Iraq Yemen and other places around the world where the US continues to be involved in active conflicts. As you can see even though BlackRock said it would like companies to implement human rights processes they continue to profit from war. BlackRock even has an iShares fund that exclusively benefits from weapons of war.

At this planning meeting for the upcoming May 25th protest of the BlackRock Shareholders meeting we’ll update everyone on some working plans including introducing our speakers and musicians as well as thinking through run-of-day logistics and roles for the day of the protest.

Please RSVP to receive the Zoom link.

Recent Articles:

I recently published a longform research piece on inflation and an article on some of the dynamics of market capitalization and asset bubbles.

This newsletter extends the topic of inflation by analyzing how it is manifesting this year in particular examines why the current situation is more comparable to the 1940s than the 1970s and finishes with some of the investment implications of it.

This past week the consumer price index came in well above consensus expectations benefiting from low-base effects and faster-than-expected price increases. The year-over-year figures are coming in rather hot at the moment:

The month-over-month figures filter out the year-ago base effects but are also very heated:

So let’s dive under the hood and see where some of this is coming from and how it is likely to manifest going forward.

The Long-Term Debt Cycle Unfolds

One of my main topics over the past 18-24 months was exploring the long-term debt cycle popularized years ago by Ray Dalio which describes a framework for expecting trend-changes in fiscal policy monetary policy and inflation/deflation.

I’ll summarize the cycle again for folks who haven’t been following my work but then also supply some new charts and tie it into some of the current trends we are seeing as of mid-2021 for those who are familiar with it.

Each normal five-to-ten year business cycle in modern US history has ended with higher debt as a percentage of GDP and lower interest rates than the previous cycle. As many of those short term debt cycles string together debt as a percentage of GDP keeps making higher highs and interest rates keep making lower lows until debts reach untenable levels and interest rates hit zero.

Rates hit zero and private debts hit extremely high levels in 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis and the last time this happened was in the early 1930s in the early phases of the Great Depression. In both instances there was a systemic banking crisis (marked in green) which led fiscal and monetary policymakers to expand the monetary base and take other measures to recapitalize the banking system.

What makes the end of a long-term debt cycle different than the end of a short-term debt cycle is that the later stages of a long-term debt cycle both in US history and elsewhere are generally characterized by a significant degree of fiscal dominance and currency devaluation.

This is because at the end of a long-term debt cycle debt levels get so large relative to the size of the economy that it becomes impossible to deleverage them nominally without crashing the economy so instead the denominators are increased: the monetary base the broad money supply and nominal GDP with a significant inflation component. The mechanism to do this involves large monetized fiscal deficits accompanied by a central bank willing to hold rates well below the prevailing inflation rate for a while which effectively inflates portions of the debt away.

The alternative to this process is a deflationary economic collapse which is a route that the public and policymakers around the world rarely if ever choose. In other words when push comes to shove and the system is pushed to its limits policymakers invariably print.

The 80-Year Echo

History can’t tell us everything but along with analysis of current conditions it can point us in the right direction.

In terms of fiscal and monetary policy the 2010s were very similar to the 1930s (disinflationary private debt bubble deleveraging) and the 2020s are shaping up more like the 1940s (inflationary fiscal-driven wartime finance). The previous chart above shows the similarities clearly but this next section elaborates on the details.

1930s and 2010s

After the debt bubble popped in 1929 the 1930s had a long deflationary private debt bubble deleveraging resulting in sluggish economic growth and rising political populism. Fiscal stimulus in that decade was large in absolute terms but small compared to the amount of money destroyed from loan losses. Most of the focus was on recapitalizing the banking system. As such the decade was disinflationary.

One very basic way to measure financial leverage in the financial system is to look at the monetary base as a percentage of total bank loans. The lower the ratio is the more leveraged the system is since there is less base money backing up the total amount of bank loans. This ratio hit a bottom at 12% right at the start of the Great Depression.

Approximately 80 years later this process began playing out again as the next long-term private debt bubble popped in 2008 and continued deleveraging into the early 2010s.

Interestingly the ratio of the monetary base compared to total bank loans hit as low as 12.5% right before the crisis:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

There is more data available for the 2008 event since it’s in modern times which allows us to examine the overleveraged bank situation from more angles.

For example here is a chart of cash levels and Treasury security levels as a percentage of total assets for large US banks:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

In 2008 large banks had less than 3% cash and 10% Treasuries or about 13% combined risk-free assets as a percentage of their total assets. That’s historically very low. Most of their other assets were loans including a lot of risky loans that went bad when the overvalued housing market declined. As banks crumbled under the private debt cycle implosion fiscal and monetary policymakers recapitalized the banking system keeping the majority of the banking system solvent but mostly letting overleveraged homeowners go bust.

Looking at it another way this next chart shows total public and private debt as a ratio of broad money supply (M2) in the United States in blue on the left axis. I also added the Federal Funds Rate and the monetary base as a percentage of GDP on the right axis.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

Total debt kept increasing faster than money supply for decades (blue line going up) with the total-debt-to-money-supply ratio reaching over 700% at the peak until the 2008 financial crisis occurred. After that implosion the money supply began growing faster than debt (blue line going down) and 2020 kicked this deleveraging process into high-gear with another leg down. The ratio is already down to below 450% and heading lower.

Looking at it a third way here is total private debt in dollar terms in the United States in blue on the left axis private debt as a ratio of GDP in red on the right axis and private debt as a ratio of broad money supply in green on the right axis.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

When private debt builds for decades up to nearly 300% of GDP and over 600% of broad money supply there’s no way to deleverage that monster nominally. From 2008 through 2012 the total deleveraging of private debt in absolute terms was only about $3.6 trillion or 8% of the $45 trillion total and then it began heading up again. Now it’s over $55 trillion.

Instead the denominator is what mainly changed. Debt started growing at a slower pace while broad money started growing faster resulting in a declining ratio of private debt to money supply.

Similarly to the 1930s the government response after the 2008 crisis and into the early part of the 2010s decade had a relatively large fiscal component but it only partially offset the loan losses in the economy rather than stimulate it. The decade was generally disinflationary as this debt bubble rolled over for years.

By the end of the 2010s decade despite recovery in some areas including a big boom in asset prices many aspects of the economy including the industrial sector and overall labor participation rate failed to fully recover from the 2008 debacle. My January newsletter called The Hindsight Depression covered this topic.

1940s and 2020s

After the 1930s decade of economic stagnation and rising political tensions around the world World War II broke out in the 1940s.

This war represented an external catalyst that forced an utterly massive fiscal response from the US federal government and other governments which dwarfed the fiscal stimulus of the 1930s. The US built a ton of domestic industrial production sent soldiers overseas and then when they came home eight million of them were given college education or training on government expense along with other benefits such as mortgage assistance. Excess industrial production was repurposed for domestic use.

Federal budget deficits were so large and so many Treasuries were issued to pay for it that the Federal Reserve had to create a lot of new base money to buy a big chunk of the Treasury bonds on the secondary market to keep yields low also known as deficit monetization and yield curve control. Unlike the disinflationary 1930s this amount of fiscal spending and deficit monetization in the 1940s was highly inflationary. Money supply and total demand increased faster than supply could keep up with.

Similarly as the 2020s began up private debt was still rather high in the system despite a decade of mild household deleveraging in the 2010s. Plus with so much wealth concentration tens of millions of people in the US couldn’t go more than a month without a paycheck. Due to a combination of multiple factors the economy began to slow by late 2018 and throughout 2019.

When COVID-19 came in early 2020 and countries initiated economic shutdowns to slow the virus it caused the highly-leveraged global economy to fracture. A global economy with this much debt is fragile and can’t persist without constant cash flow.

In response to the pandemic and shutdowns countries everywhere did fiscal stimulus on a scale not seen since World War II but the US fiscal response in particular was one of the largest as a percentage of GDP dwarfing the fiscal response to the 2008 crisis. As a result broad money supply grew at the quickest year-over-year pace since the 1940s.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

At this point the long-term debt cycle in the 2020s entered the second phase; the public debt bubble portion similar to the 1940s. Rising wealth concentration and populism along with an external catalyst changed public and policymaker perception about fiscal deficits and the floodgates were opened.

In many ways the math was inevitable by this point with high debts and low interest rates. A number of institutional-scale asset managers were predicting years ago that the next recession would involve these sorts of unusually large fiscally-driven responses based on how high debt was and how low interest rates were at this point in the long-term debt cycle which would make monetary policy on its own relatively ineffective.

In other words the pandemic was a catalyst and an accelerant but the pieces (high debt major wealth concentration and rising populism) were already set. Such a fragile system had no defense against any external shocks and an external shock we had.

Ray Dalio (co-founder of Bridgewater the largest hedge fund in the world) described in his 2018 book Big Debt Crises the concept of “monetary policy 3” which involves blending accommodative monetary policy with fiscally-driven cash infusions into the economy potentially up to and including helicopter money. He popularized the concept of the long-term debt cycle over the past decade then began saying that the late 2010s were in many ways like the late 1930s and by 2019 was making the case that the next recession would likely involve these “monetary policy 3” responses not seen since the 1940s.

Similarly BlackRock published a paper along with Stanley Fisher (former Vice-Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board of Governors) in 2019 that also laid out the concept of having to “go direct” in the next economic downturn. The paper describes aggressive use of fiscal stimulus up to and including helicopter money due to the ineffectiveness of monetary policy alone at this stage and then coordinating with monetary policymakers to use financial repression to maintain low interest rates even if there is an inflationary response from the fiscal stimulus. (Hat tip to financial analyst Luke Gromen for bringing that paper to my attention a few months ago.)

Money Supply Growth and Price Increases

Significant increases in consumer prices are generally correlated (after a slight lag) with a sharp and sustained increase in the broad money supply per capita. These charts show the rolling 5-year percent change in broad money supply per capita in blue and the 5-year rolling percent change in the consumer price index in orange.

The United States:

The United Kingdom:

Japan:

Australia:

If the broad money supply goes up quickly while commodities and other resources are abundant it doesn’t necessarily cause inflation. However when sharp growth in the money supply occurs alongside some degree of resource scarcity or supply chain limitations price inflation is quite likely.

Fiscal-Driven Inflation

There are two causes for broad money supply to go up so quickly during certain periods of time. Either 1) banks do a lot of lending which creates deposits and expands the money multiplier or 2) the government runs large fiscal deficits and has the central bank and commercial banking system buy a lot of the debt associated with that spending.

This chart shows the annual change as a percentage of GDP in broad money supply bank loans and fiscal deficits to see which levers are driving changes in money supply over time:

The 1940s money supply growth was entirely due to massive fiscal deficits rather than bank lending. Inversely the 1970s money supply growth was mostly due to high levels of bank lending which was compounded by gradually rising fiscal deficits.

1940s vs 1970s Monetary Policy Response

The US Federal Reserve responded very differently to the fiscal-driven inflation of the 1940s vs the loan-driven inflation of the 1970s.

This set of charts shows the year-over-year consumer price index in blue and short-term interest rates in red:

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

In the 1970s public and private debt as a percentage of GDP was low. Money supply was increasing more-so due to bank lending than due to fiscal deficits which means the inflation was mostly in the Fed’s court to stop. Thanks to low debt levels throughout the economy the Fed was able to raise interest rates all the way up to double-digit levels in order to slow bank lending and reduce inflation. However they were not very aggressive in doing so until the end of the decade which resulted in inflation running higher and longer than they anticipated during most of the decade.

On the other hand public debt as a percentage of GDP was very high in the 1940s. When the government’s debt as a percentage of GDP is over 100% interest rates of even mid-single-digits would result in monstrous levels of interest relative to GDP and tax receipts resulting in a fiscal spending spiral. Consumer price inflation was coming in periodic spikes from fiscal spending and changing wage/price controls but with high public debt levels the Fed held rates low and even capped long-term Treasury bond rates with quantitative easing and let inflation burn hot and inflate part of the debt away. Anyone holding physical cash cash in a bank T-bills or T-bonds lost 30-50% of their purchasing power between 1941 and 1951.

2020s Policy Response

With public and private debt levels very high relative to GDP again the 2020s are shaping up directionally similar (not necessarily in terms of magnitude) to the 1940s in terms of how the Fed is likely to respond to bursts of inflation.

We’re in the middle of an inflationary spike while the Fed commits itself to holding rates at zero and monetizing US deficits for lack of other alternatives.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

With their new policy of Average Inflation Targeting the Fed is purposely targeting above 2% inflation levels for a period of time while holding rates at zero for a while.

In addition because the inflation is fiscally-driven rather than loan-driven the Fed would see little reason to slam on the brakes immediately by raising rates if there is an inflationary spike. They’re sticking with the narrative that the inflation is transitory due to the fiscal response and supply chain shortages and thus not requiring an immediate policy response.

Plus with such high government debt levels high interest rates are untenable. By the end of this year the US government will have around $30 trillion in federal debt and rising. For every 1% average interest rate on that debt they would owe over $300 billion in annual interest. So policymakers have a strong incentive to keep rates low despite periodic inflationary events that may occur.

Transitory Inflation and Supply Shocks

You’ll often hear from policymakers or the media that inflation is transitory.

Many types of inflation occur rapidly and then suddenly cool off. Indeed here’s a model of what price inflation might look like this year:

Chart Source: Steno Larsen Enlund Sarwe at Nordea

However as I described in my recent article on inflation there’s a big difference between inflation that is only transitory in rate of change terms and inflation that is truly transitory in absolute terms.

Inflation that is truly transitory in absolute terms would mean that a lot of prices go up due to a temporary supply shock of some sort and then come back down when the supply shock is over.

On the other hand inflation that is only transitory in rate of change terms would mean that a broad set of prices jump quickly and then stop going up quickly but never actually come back down. Instead they go through a permanent step-wise increase in price levels and reach a new equilibrium at a higher level.

This first chart here shows the year-over-year consumer price index change (aka price inflation) in the 1940s. Indeed each inflationary spike was transitory. However the second chart shows the absolute level of the consumer price index. After each inflationary spike prices remained at that permanently higher plateau. In other words inflation was transitory in rate of change terms but not absolute terms.

Chart Source: St. Louis Fed

The current inflationary spike that we’re seeing in 2021 is being dismissed as being caused by supply shocks. But of course all inflationary events involve supply shocks. That’s one of the inherent catalysts of why inflation happens every time.

The 1940s had all sorts of war-related commodity and labor shortages. The 1970s had the oil embargo. The 2020s have semiconductor shortages various commodity shortages and shipping constraints.

External/accidental supply shocks on their own eventually result in prices returning to normal when the anomalous supply shock is resolved. They involve specific goods/services.

On the other hand rapid increases in the broad money supply that boost demand for goods and services without boosting the supply of goods and services result in supply shocks and cause price inflation. As the market adjusts over time this price inflation becomes transitory in rate of change terms but with prices that ultimately settle at a higher level due to more money permanently being in the system. This second type of inflation is likely what we’re experiencing at this time.

Some specific parabolic price levels will almost certainly come back down pretty far. Lumber’s extreme price behavior for example is due to an acute sawmill bottleneck.

However many prices are unlikely to revert back to where they were pre-2021. Many companies including Procter and Gamble (PG) and Coca Cola (KO) are raising prices due to higher input costs. Many commodities such as copper are unlikely to fully retrace their 2020/2021 gains. Chipotle (CMG) is unlikely to reverse the shift towards $15 average wages once it implements them. These are higher equilibrium levels with a lot more money in the system.

And as Warren Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting in early May:

We are seeing very substantial inflation. We are raising prices. People are raising prices to us and it’s being accepted.

Portfolio Updates

I have several investment accounts and I provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks.

These portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account. Members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates.

I use a free account at Personal Capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth.

M1 Finance Newsletter Portfolio

I started this account in September 2018 with $10k of new capital and I put new money in regularly. Currently I put in $1000 per month.

It’s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where I think value is in the market. It’s a low-turnover multi-asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size.

I chose M1 Finance because their platform is commission-free and allows for a combo of ETF and individual stock selection with automatic and/or manual rebalancing. It makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility and it’s the investment platform I recommend to most people. (See my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with M1.)

And here’s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices:

Changes since the previous issue:

I made very few changes since the April newsletter since the portfolio has generally been well-positioned for this environment.

I’ve been emphasizing gold stocks a bit more recently as they showed signs of bottoming in recent months while trimming some of the high-flying commodity producers like Nucor Steel (NUE) and buying more stocks in the healthcare sector. The energy sector looks good going forward as well from a long-term perspective.

M1 Finance doesn’t have an option to hold bitcoin; I hold bitcoin in cold storage.

Primary Retirement Portfolio

My retirement portfolio consists of index funds that automatically rebalance themselves regularly and I rarely make changes.

Here’s the allocation today:

From 2010 through 2016 this account was aggressively positioned with 90% in equities and enjoyed the long bull market.

Starting in 2017 in order to preserve capital I dialed my equity allocation down to 60% (40% domestic 20% foreign) and increased allocations to short-term bonds and cash to 40%. This was due to higher stock valuations and being later in the market cycle more generally.

After equities took a big hit in Q1 2020 I shifted some of the bonds back to equities and it is now 71% equities (46% domestic 25% foreign) and short-term bonds and cash is now down to 29%. For my TSP readers this is equivalent to the 2040 Lifecycle Fund.

This is an example of a portfolio strategy that takes a rather hands-off approach but that still makes a tactical adjustment every few years if needed based on market conditions which reduces volatility and makes the retirement account feel less like a casino than many indices these days.

This employer-based retirement account is limited to a very small number of funds to invest in so my flexibility is limited compared to my other accounts. I would for example have more exposure to precious metals commodities and digital assets in that account if it were an option.

Other Model Portfolios and Accounts

I have three other real-money model portfolios that I share within my premium research service including:

Fortress Income Portfolio

ETF-Only Portfolio

No Limits Portfolio

Plus I have larger personal accounts at Fidelity and Schwab and I share those within the service as well.

Final Thoughts: Navigating the 2020s

In this environment I’m generally more bullish on stocks that traditionally fall in the “value” side of the spectrum. Energy producers and transporters financial institutions industrial companies gold miners and pharmaceutical companies all look reasonably-valued and are benefitting from a pro-inflationary environment. I like certain growth stocks as well but selectively.

Indeed there has been somewhat of a growth-to-value rotation similar to the early 2000s. This chart is the ratio of the Russell 1000 Value index to the Russell 1000 Growth index. Whenever it’s going up it means value is outperforming and whenever it is going down it means growth is outperforming.

The late 2010s look a lot like the late 1990s in terms of equity sector performance and macro factors.

Both environments had a strengthening dollar low commodity prices and major tech/growth sector outperformance. When the reversal occurred in the early 2000s it led to over half a decade of a weakening dollar strengthening commodities value equity outperformance and international stock outperformance. My base case is to see a similar outcome in the 2020s.

However I expect the 2020s to be a bumpy ride. Fluctuating periods of aggressive or nonexistent fiscal policy will likely play the leading role in inflationary spikes and inflationary cool-off periods. The Fed mostly has to keep rates low regardless of what inflation does dismissing it as transitory and supply-chain related but they could have periods of time where they briefly try to tighten and slow things down before reverting course and turning dovish again when something breaks.

So we need to stay on our toes monitor economic indicators in rate of change terms and focus on quality-businesses at good valuations.

Two years ago near the end of the past business cycle a number of magazines started to run covers about inflation being a thing of the past. Here in mid-2021 inflation is becoming a popular theme on magazine covers.

Like most things I expect this will get overplayed for periods of time. I’d suggest fading headlines and parabolic commodity price spikes. Lumber prices for example already hit extremely high levels and in recent days have been turning back down. That’s not a commodity I’m particularly bullish on from current elevated levels.

However I think it’s worth keeping an eye on things that haven’t truly broken out yet like the energy sector and the gold industry. Some of these areas have long runways of ahead of them in my view. Within the past month parts of the world are still undergoing rolling lockdowns and virus case spikes so some aspects of the global economy like the energy market aren’t even fully recovered yet.

Drawing a record number of over 300 attendees the protest centered the human rights of Palestinians and culminated in the arrest of one protester who was tackled by police. Five members of the International Imagination of Anti-National Anti-Imperialist Feelings a coalition of activist organizations that have been staging weekly protests against the museum since April 9th have been permanently banned from MoMA.

Under the slogan of “All Eyes on Palestine” protesters waved Palestinian flags at Urban Plaza across from MoMA on West 53rd Street and hosted teach-ins about the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Speakers also highlighted the investments of MoMA trustees like Larry Fink and Leon Black in companies that supply weapons and equipment to the Israeli military. Fink’s company BlackRock is invested in Lockheed Martin which has been supplying the Israeli army with weapons since 1971 including F-35 fighter jets. Both BlackRock and Apollo Global Management Black’s private equity company have investments in General Electric which supplies the Israel army with a whole host of military equipment.

“The wealth of these [trustees] was built on the oppression of Palestinians” one speaker said. The crowds chanted slogans like “Free Palestine” “Resistance is Justified When People Are Occupied” and “There’s Only One Solution Intifada Revolution.”

Before the action began one of the activists was informed by MoMA security guards that she had been permanently banned from the museum following the events of a “Strike MoMA” protest on April 30 which culminated in a standoff between the two parties. The artist-activist a former educator at the museum says they were assaulted by a security officer while attempting to protest inside the museum. The museum instead says that three of its security officers were injured when a group of five protesters including the former educator attempted to breach the museum via its staff entrance at 11 West 53rd Street. In an email to staff on May 3 MoMA director Glenn Lowry repeated these allegations describing the protest as a “harrowing day at the Museum.” The activists denied the museum’s accusations calling Lowry MoMA’s “Gaslighter-in-Chief.”

In an email to Hyperallergic a spokesperson for MoMA said the former educator along with four other protesters are “are no longer welcome at the Museum.”

“While MoMA respects the rights of all to make their voices heard we have a zero-tolerance policy for individuals who endanger staff visitors artwork or any Museum property” the spokesperson said adding that the protesters “repeatedly harassed and assaulted security officers there in direct violation of our visitor code of conduct.”

The museum has previously refused to provide any evidence of the alleged assault of security guards by the protesters.

One of the banned activists a young woman of color who works at a nonprofit and requested her identity remain anonymous told Hyperallergic in response: “I won’t miss a place that never welcomed me in the first place.”

This feeling of exclusion carried over into the events on May 14 when a large force of New York Police Department (NYPD) officers and MoMA security personnel fortified the museum while Urban Plaza was swelling with protesters.

“It saddens me that after a major global pandemic that has decimated communities we even have to have a conversation about basic human rights” Evan Lenox-Samour a New York-based artist of Palestinian descent who attended the protest told Hyperallergic. “We want peace not apartheid.”

Around 4:40pm two protesters in a car blocked traffic in front of MoMA on West 53rd Street for several minutes. The driver Saada Mansour climbed atop the car to wave a large Palestinian flag at the cheering crowd. A few minutes later five NYPD officers who arrived at the scene followed Mansour to a parking facility beside the museum on 53rd Street and arrested him after forcing him to the ground.

Mansour’s brother Modran who shared a video of the incident with Hyperallergic said that the officers punched his brother repeatedly before handcuffing him and taking him away in a police car. The video shows the five officers piling over Saada Mansour asking him to “stop resisting.” His brother who documented the arrest with his phone is heard repeating the words “He’s not resisting.”

Meanwhile an NYPD force of at least a dozen officers arrived at the museum. A tense exchange ensued between some of the demonstrators and the officers over Mansour’s arrest.

Minutes later the activists marched in the hundreds to Midtown Precinct North (18th Precinct) on West 54th Street and Eighth Avenue where Mansour was allegedly being held. NYPD officers on the scene declined to provide Hyperallergic with information about the facility in which Mansour was held or the charges against him.

On their way to the police precinct the protesters held traffic at several intersections in Midtown Manhattan while carrying banners and chanting slogans for Palestinian liberation. Some of the demonstrators who are not affiliated with Strike MoMA burnt Israeli flags.

At the precinct activists staged a sit-in that halted traffic at Eighth Avenue for about half an hour. They demanded information about Mansour’s arrest from dozens of NYPD officers who barricaded and guarded the precinct. The protesters then held a “jail support” for Mansour which included dance music and prayers. “Let him out” they chanted in unison.

“Five minutes of traffic are not worse than genocide” Nerdeen Kiswani a member of the Palestinian-led organization Within Our Lifetime cried through a bullhorn.

While many passersby approved of the rally including drivers who honked their car horns in solidarity with Palestine some found it disagreeable. A former US Marine who witnessed the protest from the other side of the street told Hyperallergic: “If Hamas fired the rockets Israel should go into Gaza and kick ass.”

By contrast a middle-aged New Yorker who was swatching the protest on her way home from work said that she’s not bothered by the peaceful demonstration. “I just wish that Palestinians and Israelis would learn to share the land they live in” she said.

Mansour was finally released around 9pm and was taken immediately by his brother and other activists to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. Soon after protesters began to disperse promising to return to MoMA for another passionate demonstration next Friday.

At least 197 Palestinians including 58 children have been killed in Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza since Monday May 8. On the Israeli side 10 people have died from rockets fired from Gaza by the militant group Hamas.

“You are now witnessing not only a genocide in Palestine but the entire colonial entity of Israel forcing itself through bombs and raids and mortars on Palestinian land” Kiswani told protesters in a speech. “You’ve been witnessing it for 73 years but in this moment of escalation nobody can say they did not know.”"

Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

In the late 1960s Blackstone Rangers leader Jeff Fort received an anonymous letter warning him that local Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton wanted to kill him. Curiously Hampton received an anonymous letter that said Fort wanted him killed. Both letters were signed by a “concerned black brother.”

Fort found the letter amusing and doubted its authenticity. Conventional street wisdom back then was that street brothers didn’t write letters to each other about potential hits. Fort was right. Years later it was revealed that the FBI sent those anonymous missives.

Fort and Hampton had briefly met on Chicago’s South Side with Panther Bobby Rush in attendance. The Panthers desired to politicize the Stones in the struggle for Black liberation. A coalition between the two organizations never happened in part because in 1969 police and the FBI killed Hampton in his West Side home as he slept. But the letter speaks volumes about the degree to which the feds employed illegal tactics to sow dissension and chaos.

I wrote about this along with Lance Williams in our 2011 book The Almighty Black P Stone Nation: The Rise Fall and Resurgence of an American Gang . We obtained those FBI records that included the “concerned brother” letter because a pair of lawyers — Jeffrey Haas and Flint Taylor of the People’s Law Office in Chicago — had already fought for their release. The documents fell under FBI director J. Edgar Hoover’s notorious and clandestine COINTELPRO in which agents targeted liberation groups during the civil rights movement from 1956 to 1971.

Now Congressman Rush is taking aim at the program and has introduced legislation that would require the release and public disclosure of all records related to COINTELPRO which targeted Martin Luther King Jr. Stokely Carmichael Billie Holiday Nina Simone Malcolm X and groups such as the American Indian Movement (AIM) and Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

“The dark legacy of COINTELPRO remains a stain on our nation and it is incumbent on those of us in positions of power to get the truth about this program out to the American people. It is also vital to the future of civil rights in our nation” Rush said in a recent statement. “We must pull back the curtain on the FBI’s racially and politically motivated espionage on its own citizens. My bill would also remove the name of J. Edgar Hoover who was the number one assailant on America’s constitutional guarantees for its citizens from the FBI building in Washington D.C.”

Haas author of The Assassination of Fred Hampton  has defended Panthers and written extensively about COINTELPRO’s role in the revolutionary’s killing. Haas told me there’s still a lot to comb through with the case if Rush’s bill is passed and a flood of files come into public view.

“I think there’s a lot more particularly with regard to the Fred raid and the coverup” Haas said. “There’s some pretty damning stuff. We know Hoover was afraid of everything that people of color did to the left. We could assume that there were many other people on whom there are many files.”

I imagine releasing those files would keep journalists lawyers and scholars busy for decades. Keeping a secret program cloaked in secrecy today is a disservice. It took Haas years to get some of the documentation Lance and I were able to get. Knowing about the letter incident continues to inform us today. Haas said Rush’s bill could also prove revelatory to current iterations today — from the standoff at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation over a pipeline being built to uprisings in Ferguson Mo. after the shooting death of Michael Brown by police and the longtime collusion between government and private security forces.

“Uncovering how far our government went is an indication of where it might be going or what it can do. We know that it monitored and tracked and arrested and worked with law enforcement against various Black Lives Matters protests” Haas said.

Renewed interest around COINTELPRO is in part because of the recent movie Judas and the Black Messiah which dramatizes the FBI-orchestrated killing of Hampton. Opening up the FBI records to the public would bring full circle a lot we don’t know about Hoover’s paranoia and tactics in trying to suppress activism and equal rights.

“We’re entitled to make sure that our government protects our right to speak and assemble and speak out and not inhibit or try to destroy whether clandestinely or otherwise legitimate movements” Haas said. “Most of the progress in this country has come from people in the streets raising issues — whether it’s the women’s movement the civil rights movement the gay movement the anti-war movement around Vietnam.”

The government should never target people or infiltrate organizations that disagree with U.S. policies Haas said. COINTELPRO leaves a stain on this nation but we can’t truly reckon with its devastation until every single file is out in the open.

Here's Why.,"It's too late for Boeing to design a clean-sheet competitor to the Airbus A321XLR.

Boeing (BA 0.28%) is ramping up planning for a new jet that would bridge the yawning gap between its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner models after scrapping an earlier midsize aircraft concept last year. Engine maker Rolls-Royce recently confirmed that it is talking to Boeing about providing engines for a potential new aircraft project.

On the one hand it's heartening to see that Boeing is ready to buckle down and invest in all-new jet designs after its attempt to update the 737 quickly and cheaply (in the form of the 737 MAX) backfired spectacularly. On the other hand starting to design a new ""middle of the market"" jet now seems unlikely to work out well for Boeing. Let's take a look.

Bridging the gap

Boeing is planning for its next jet to replace the 757 and 767 models that it introduced four decades ago. The new aircraft would fill a gaping hole in Boeing's current product portfolio between the largest 737 MAX model (the 737 MAX 10) and the smallest Dreamliner model (the 787-8).

At first glance the gap between the 737 MAX 10 and the 787-8 might not seem very large. Boeing describes the 737 MAX 10 as fitting 188 to 204 seats in a two-class configuration compared to 248 seats in a two-class configuration for the 787-8. However this comparison is misleading.

First the 737 MAX 10 has a range of just 3300 nautical miles. In real-world terms that isn't sufficient to serve many markets typically flown by 757s and 767s. By contrast the 787-8 has more than 7300 nautical miles of range.

Second Boeing assumes that airlines will use a roomier two-class configuration on the 787-8 -- which is designed for longer routes -- than on the 737 MAX 10. The maximum capacity of the 787-8 in a single-class configuration is 359 seats: a whopping 56% more than the 737 MAX 10's maximum single-class capacity of 230 seats.

In short a new Boeing midsize aircraft would sit in between the 737 MAX 10 and the 787-8 in terms of seating capacity and range (and presumably price). It would compete primarily with Airbus' (EADSY 0.85%) A321XLR which is only slightly larger than the 737 MAX 10 but has a range of 4700 nautical miles: enough to serve many transatlantic U.S.-Brazil Europe-India and Asia-Australia routes (just to give a few examples).

Too late and too expensive

In theory a purpose-built jet that was bigger than the Airbus A321XLR and had more range would be superior for replacing 767s and capturing growth opportunities on mid-range routes. There are two big problems though: any jet Boeing designs now will arrive too late and will be too expensive to sell well.

Indeed a new Boeing jet would probably enter service in 2028 or 2029 at best. Most of the 757s and 767s flying for passenger airlines were delivered before 2002 and will be overdue for replacement by then. As a result American Airlines and United Airlines -- historically two of the biggest operators of 757s and 767s -- have each ordered 50 Airbus A321XLRs.

They aren't the only ones. All told Airbus has racked up hundreds of orders for the A321XLR. Other customers include IAG (parent of Aer Lingus and Iberia) Qantas and a slew of low-cost carriers. In short many airlines have already committed to the A321XLR for mid-range routes because Boeing wasn't offering an alternative. And Airbus will likely continue to pick up orders by default simply because Boeing's competitor won't be ready soon.

Boeing will also struggle to price a clean-sheet airplane competitively. The A321XLR was a relatively straightforward derivative of the A321neo and builds on an established production system. By contrast Boeing would be developing its alternative and building a new production system from scratch: both expensive undertakings (notwithstanding Boeing's rhetoric about new ways of engineering and manufacturing aircraft). Even if Boeing creates a technically superior jet Airbus could win a lot of orders by undercutting it on price.

A tough uphill climb

The 757 and 767 replacement market isn't very big at this point: certainly not big enough to support a clean-sheet aircraft design. On top of that Airbus' A321XLR has already captured a substantial chunk of the 757 and 767 replacement business.

To be sure small mid-range aircraft could become much more common over the next decade or two. However the A321XLR is positioned to win the bulk of this business too because it will be ready in 2023 it shares commonality with the massively popular A320 family and it will be cheaper than any clean-sheet Boeing competitor.

Launching a new aircraft program to fill the gap between the 737 MAX 10 and 787-8 might seem promising in the abstract. However between the A321XLR's huge head start and low cost profile I'm skeptical that such a program would be profitable for Boeing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmlnLXR3aW4taW5zaWRlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXR3aW4tZW5naW5lLWNhcmdvLXBsYW5lLTIwMjEtNdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmlnLXR3aW4taW5zaWRlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXR3aW4tZW5naW5lLWNhcmdvLXBsYW5lLTIwMjEtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Twin: Inside the making of the world's largest 2-engine cargo plane,"Right now the Boeing 747 is the largest mainstream cargo plane but its reign may be coming to an end.

This is exactly what happened on Saturday when Air New Zealand used a Boeing 787-9 specifically to draw a kiwi the national bird of New Zealand in the sky.And while it all sounds like a waste of time and resources well it was not. The whole thing was part of a charity flight operated for Koru Care an organization working together with Air New Zealand and whose purpose is to support children with disabilities.So what the two companies did was board some 50 kids on a Boeing 787  take off from Christchurch spend 2 hours and 41 minutes in the air and during this whole time try to draw a kiwi in the sky. Flight data shared by RadarBox shows the whole thing was successful with the flight NZ4376 eventually returning to the airport after an epic experience.Air New Zealand CEO Greg Foran said the whole purpose of this idea was to give kids who never had the chance to board an airplane the opportunity to discover how the whole thing feels on their own.“Today’s flight is a real heart warmer. Some of these children have never been on a plane before so we wanted them to experience the excitement of flying and our teams have pulled out all the stops to make today a magical experience for our Little Heroes” he said.Needless to say Air New Zealand isn’t the first airline that comes up with the idea of drawing something in the sky. Previously Virgin Atlantic drew a heart on Valentine’s Day while Qantas used a Boeing 747 to sketch a kangaroo in the sky before retiring this aircraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvYWlycGxhbmUtYXJ0LXVuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1ib2VpbmctNzc3LXN0YXItYWxsaWFuY2UtbG9nb2pldC1hcHByb2FjaGluZy1jaGljYWdvLW9oYXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Airplane Art - United Airlines Boeing 777 ""Star Alliance"" Logojet approaching Chicago O'Hare - Economy Class & Beyond","It’s Sunday again so it must be time for some more airplane art.

The researchers analyzed real-world data from more than 36000 procedures recorded in the ACC’s National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) LAAO Registry a registry that includes almost all LAAO procedures performed in the U.S. The study includes data from patients who received a Watchman device in 2016 2017 or 2018.[1]

The Watchman is a self-expanding transcatheter occluder that closes off the LAA to prevent the formation of clots in patients with AF. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015. The device is used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AFib. It is also used in patients who require an alternative to the long-term use of anticoagulant medications. These blood thinners are the primary medical option for reducing the risk of strokes which are caused when a blood clot blocks an artery in the brain but can cause drug interactions increased bleeding risks side effects and logistical challenges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) specify that patients receiving the Watchman device should be at high risk for stroke and unable to take long-term oral anticoagulation.

This study an analysis of a prospective registry of patients who received a Watchman device found that in practice the rate of ischemic stroke (the study’s primary endpoint) was generally on par with rates seen in clinical trials leading to the device’s approval. The findings offer reassurance that LAAO with the Watchman device is likely effective for the patient population currently receiving it according to the researchers.

“Based on these data it seems like we’re doing the right thing” said Matthew J. Price M.D. director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla California and the study’s lead author. “The rate of ischemic stroke was low and supports the clinical effectiveness of transcatheter LAAO as it is currently applied in the U.S.”

Patients in the registry were on average significantly older and at higher risk than those who were included in clinical trials for the Watchman device Price said. The average age of patients in the registry was 76 years; one-quarter of the patients had previously had a stroke many were deemed to be at high risk for falls and nearly 70% had previously experienced clinically relevant bleeding.

After a follow-up period of one year an estimated 1.53% of patients in the registry suffered an ischemic stroke 8.52% died and less than 0.7% experienced systemic embolism.

“I was actually a bit surprised by the relatively low event rates because the patients are substantially higher risk than those studied in clinical trials” Price said. “However all-cause mortality as well as bleeding in the weeks following the procedure were not infrequent — consistent with the co-morbidities of this patient population. This underscores the need to individualize one’s approach to stroke prevention so that patients reap the clinical benefit of stroke reduction.”

The rate of stroke was 77% lower than would be predicted by the patients’ CHA2DS2-VASc scores a measure of stroke risk for patients with AFib. The study focused only on outcomes from LAAO procedures using the Watchman device; future studies are planned to assess clinical efficacy at three and four years.

“By providing more data I think this study continues to support LAAO in patients who are not suitable for long-term oral anticoagulation” Price said. “The apparently low ischemic stroke event rates also provide support for ongoing clinical trials for LAAO versus oral anticoagulants in patients who are suitable for long-term oral anticoagulation.”

Because it is based on registry data the study lacked a control group that did not receive the Watchman device for comparison. However the event rates observed in the study are consistent with those in other registry studies and clinical trials. Price said future research could focus on assessing LAAO in a broader patient population and on outcomes from new devices or techniques for performing the procedure.

The study was supported by the ACC’s NCDR and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.

Ajay J. Kirtane

In a clinical trial of the procedure called renal denervation daytime blood pressure after two months had dropped 8 points compared to a 3-point drop in patients who were treated with a sham procedure. Nighttime blood pressure decreased by an average of 8.3 points in the treatment group versus 1.8 points in the sham group.

“For patients with drug-resistant hypertension a drop in blood pressure of 8 points—if maintained over longer-term follow-up—is almost certainly going to help reduce the risk of heart attack stroke and other adverse cardiac events” says Ajay Kirtane MD professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons an interventional cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the trial.

“These results suggest that renal denervation has potential to become an important add-on to medication therapy—including for those who have difficulty managing several medications to control their hypertension.”

Data from the trial called RADIANCE-HTN TRIO were presented May 16 at the American College of Cardiology conference and simultaneously published in The Lancet.

The treatment is still experimental has not been approved for use by the FDA and is only available through clinical trials. The trial will follow patients for five years to determine if the drop in blood pressure is maintained over time.

Need for additional blood pressure-lowering therapies

About two-thirds of people who take medications to lower blood pressure are able to control their condition. But in others the drugs do not work or people do not take them as directed.

“There are a variety of effective medications for lowering blood pressure but many people need to take several drugs to control their hypertension which can have side effects. In addition many people simply don’t want to take additional medications and are poorly adherent to them” says Kirtane. “It’s clear that we need additional therapeutic approaches to help patients get their blood pressure under control.”

Why renal denervation?

The kidney plays a role in blood pressure by controlling how much water is in the bloodstream (more water = more pressure) and acting as a central signaling center for other systems that regulate blood pressure. Renal denervation a minimally invasive procedure uses ultrasound energy to disrupt signals from overactive nerves in the renal arteries. The therapy is delivered via a catheter that is threaded through an artery in the leg.

Targeting these nerves is not a new idea in hypertension treatment; several existing medications reduce renal nerve activity to reduce blood pressure.

“But unlike medications which are only effective when you take them renal denervation is a therapy that’s always ‘on’” Kirtane says.

Initial studies of renal denervation had several flaws—including the lack of an adequate control group variable measurement of participants' blood pressure and frequent changes in background medications—that made the results challenging to interpret.

How the study worked

In this study the researchers tested the effectiveness and safety of a device that delivers two to three short blasts of ultrasound to nerve fibers that travel close to the renal artery.

The study included adults with moderate to severe hypertension despite taking three or more antihypertensive drugs. All of the patients were switched to the same medication regimen for their hypertension. (To help with patient adherence participants took a single pill that combined three commonly used antihypertensive drugs.)

“In our study 80% of patients continued to take their medication as directed and while that’s a good adherence rate it still means that one in five patients weren’t adherent to the medication regimen” Kirtane adds.

Of 136 patients whose blood pressure remained high after four weeks on the new regimen 69 were treated with renal denervation and 67 had the sham procedure.

Previous studies in patients with less severe hypertension who were not taking any antihypertensive medications showed that renal denervation was more effective than a sham procedure in lowering blood pressure.

“Additional studies will be needed to determine if this therapy may be effective for other groups including older patients with hypertension and those with chronic kidney disease” says Kirtane.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvdy0xLXllYXItc3Ryb2tlLXJpc2stYWZ0ZXItY29tbWVyY2lhbC13YXRjaG1hbi11c2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low 1-Year Stroke Risk After Commercial Watchman Use,"The registry findings support the effectiveness of transcatheter LAA occlusion as practiced in the US a researcher says.

The estimated 1-year rate of ischemic stroke after implantation of the Watchman left atrial appendage (LAA) closure device (Boston Scientific) was 1.53% in its first few years of commercial use in the United States which encompassed a relatively high-risk population of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) registry data show.

That’s substantially lower than would be expected in a cohort of patients with a similar thromboembolic risk based on CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score who are not taking oral anticoagulation (6.64%) Matthew Price MD (Scripps Clinic La Jolla CA) reported Saturday during the virtual American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2021 Scientific Session.

The low thromboembolic event rate observed in the study which used information from the ACC’s National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) LAAO Registry “supports the early-to-midterm clinical effectiveness of transcatheter LAAO as it is being currently utilized in the United States” Price said.

“The not-insubstantial risks of bleeding in the early postdischarge period and of the risk of death unrelated to thromboembolism should be incorporated into a patient-centered [decision] when selecting the appropriate stroke prevention strategy for A-fib patients unable to take long-term oral anticoagulation” he added.

Commenting for TCTMD Christine Albert MD (Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Los Angeles CA) said the study was limited by its lack of a contemporary comparator group pointing out that the ischemic stroke rate estimated using historical data was “rather high.” Even so she said “I think overall it’s very reassuring because you would at least expect that [the ischemic stroke rate] would be higher than what they found” given the level of risk in the registry patients.

Higher-Risk Patients in the Real World

Price noted that the populations treated in the pivotal Watchman trials—PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL—differed from the types of patients that have been treated following US Food and Drug Administration approval of the device driven by requirements for coverage laid out by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In particular patients in the trials had to be eligible for long-term warfarin therapy whereas CMS has said patients should be suitable for short-term warfarin therapy but unable to take long-term oral anticoagulation.

Not surprisingly Price said a previous report from the LAAO Registry showed that patients treated after Watchman’s approval were higher risk than the trial participants—they tended to be older had higher rates of prior stroke/TIA and diabetes and had higher estimated risks of thromboembolic events and bleeding. Nevertheless the registry patients had lower rates of in-hospital complications than were seen in the trials.

For this new study Price and colleagues examined 1-year outcomes in the LAAO Registry. The analysis included 36681 patients (mean age 76 years; 59% men) who underwent an attempted or successful Watchman procedure between 2016 and 2018. Mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 4.8 mean HAS-BLED score was 3.0 and more than two-thirds of patients (69.5%) had experienced prior clinically relevant major bleeding. Median follow-up was 373 days.

The primary endpoint was ischemic stroke with 1-year rates calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method to account for variable lengths of follow-up. Despite the high-risk nature of the patients included the estimated stroke rate (1.53%) was consistent with prior RCTs and registries of the Watchman device Price reported.

The estimated 1-year rate of major bleeding was 6.2% with most bleeds occurring between discharge and 45 days (the in-hospital rate was 1.3%) he noted. Although postprocedural pharmacotherapy was not available for this study Price said a prior analysis showed that 80% to 90% of patients in this registry were discharged on oral anticoagulation.

“In context the relatively low ischemic stroke [rate] cannot be ascribed to LAAO alone because patients do take a short term of postprocedural pharmacotherapy but certainly given the risk of the population the results are reassuring that how we’re practicing medicine now in the United States—putting in a Watchman and using these pharmacotherapies afterwards—translates into a low thromboembolic event rate” he said during a panel discussion after his presentation.

All-cause mortality occurred at an estimated rate of 8.52% during the first year with most of the deaths (60.3%) attributed to noncardiovascular causes; one-third (32.6%) were classified at CV deaths.

Reliance on Shared Decision-making

Albert noted that the estimated bleeding and mortality rates were high but said it “speaks to the patient population that’s getting these devices at this point. They’re very sick in a lot of ways.”

Whether those rates are higher than would be seen in a similar population of patients who cannot take long-term anticoagulation and are not treated with the Watchman is hard to say without a randomized trial but such a trial is unlikely to happen at this point because the device is already being used clinically Albert said. PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL suggest that Watchman is at least comparable to oral anticoagulation she added.

“I think we have enough data to know that the concept of occluding the left atrial appendage probably does prevent stroke” Albert said noting that there could be some debate about whether withholding LAA occlusion in patients who can’t receive oral anticoagulation when there might a benefit would be ethical at this point. Ongoing trials comparing the Watchman device with the direct oral anticoagulants in patients who are eligible for long-term anticoagulation will provide some insights into the effectiveness of percutaneous LAA occlusion she said.

Though the trial didn’t involve transcatheter LAA occlusion LAAOS III—presented earlier in the day today—provided impressive results indicating a reduction in ischemic stroke with surgical LAA occlusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for another reason Albert noted. “So the concept that left atrial appendage occlusion prevents stroke is stronger now because of that randomized trial.”

In a panel discussion after Price’s presentation Jodie Hurwitz MD (Medical City Hospital Dallas TX) hinted that a stronger guideline recommendation for the Watchman might be warranted.

Price responded by noting that an attempt to do a randomized trial in patients with contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation—ASAP-TOO—was discontinued due to low enrollment making it unlikely that there will be randomized data for this cohort. But the findings from the current study are reassuring he said.

Albert too was hesitant to support any changes to guidelines in the absence of a randomized trial. “I think it’s hard to get to a class I indication without that” she said also highlighting the data from the LAAO Registry showing a low stroke rate in a relatively high-risk population. “I think that it’s at least reassuring that it wasn’t 4% or something like that. So it’s good data to know that it does appear to be working but I just don’t know if it will change the guidelines.”

For now the choice to use the Watchman is “really at ‘shared decision-making’ still” Albert said. She said she considers using the device when a patient can’t tolerate long-term anticoagulation and she wants to offer some protection against stroke. “But there are patients in this category that choose not to have a Watchman and can’t be anticoagulated. So that’s why the recommendations I think are the way they are is that you really do have to be allowed to put up what the data are for the patient so that they can make an informed decision.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhza3kub3JnL2VhcnRoL3NpbmdsZS1jZWxsZWQtdG8tbXVsdGktY2VsbGVkLWxha2Utc2VkaW1lbnRzLXNjb3RsYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New clues to ancient life from billion-year-old lake fossils | Earth,"The beginnings of life on Earth billions of years ago from simple single-celled organisms to more complex multicellular ones is a widely accepted fact in science. But there are gaps or missing links in life’s timeline as it’s known to science. In April 2021 scientists led by Paul Strother of Boston College reported on the discovery of new microfossils in ancient Scottish lake sediments that could help fill in the gap between the earliest single-celled life and multicellular life. These scientists say these microscopic fossils could be the oldest example of complex multicellular life in the evolutionary lineage leading to animals. They say the fossils are also significant because they come – not from ocean sediments – but from sediments of an ancient freshwater lake.

The peer-reviewed findings were published in the journal Current Biology on April 13 2021.

The one-billion-year-old multicellular microfossils – Bicellum brasieri – were found in sediments that used to be at the bottom of Loch Torridan in Scotland’s northwest highlands. Co-author Charles Wellman of the University of Sheffield in the U.K. commented in a statement:

The origins of complex multicellularity and the origin of animals are considered two of the most important events in the history of life on Earth. Our discovery sheds new light on both of these.

About Bicellum brasieri. Bicellum means “two-celled” and brasieri is used to honor the late paleontologist and study co-author Martin Brasier.

These fossils appear as tiny microscopic balls each containing two different kinds of cells. The cells inside the ball are round and tightly-packed with thin cell walls. The outer layer or surface of the balls however are composed of longer sausage-shaped cells that have thicker cell walls.

These fossils are clearly of multicelled organisms the scientists say albeit simple ones. But there’s an interesting puzzle. The fossils were found in ancient lake sediments but most scientists think that multicellular life first began to appear in Earth’s primordial oceans.

The fossils were found in nodules of phosphate minerals. According to lead author Paul Strother those nodules were:

… Like little black lenses in rock strata about one centimeter [0.4 inches] in thickness. We take those and slice them with a diamond saw and make thin sections out of them.

Those very thin sections can then be studied under a microscope.

The researchers found multiple clumps of the Bicellum brasieri fossils which all showed the same structure and organization regardless of their stage of development.

These fossils are extremely tiny measuring only 0.001 inches (0.03 mm) in diameter. But when examined under powerful microscopes the researchers noticed that the two kinds of cells in the balls differed both in shape and how and where they were positioned within the balls. Why is that significant? As Strother told LiveScience.com:

That’s something that doesn’t exist in normal unicellular organisms. That amount of structural complexity is something that we normally associate with complex multicellularity.

This raises more questions. What type of organism is Bicellum brasieri? The scientists still don’t know for sure but they don’t think it is a kind of algae since the round cells don’t have rigid walls. Bicellum brasieri might instead have been a type of Holozoa which includes both multicellular animals and single-celled organisms. Holozoa can include animals and their closest single-celled relatives but it excludes fungi.

Due to constant geological processes on our active planet there aren’t a lot of fossil records left from the very earliest life on Earth. The oldest known fossils of microbes are about 3.5 billion years old. That’s fossils of the microorganisms themselves; other fossils associated with microbes are known to be up to 3.7 billion years old. These include sediment ripples on an ancient seafloor in Greenland and hematite tubes in volcanic rock in Quebec Canada.

Scientists have thought that the earliest microscopic life forms originated in the oceans because that is where most ancient fossils have been found in marine sediments as opposed to sediments in freshwater lakes. Strother explained:

There aren’t that many lake deposits of this antiquity so there’s a bias in the rock record toward a marine fossil record rather than a freshwater record.

But the discovery of Bicellum brasieri now throws a wrench into that hypothesis. It shows that the transition from single-celled microbes to multicellular ones could also have occurred in lakes despite the fact that lakes are more greatly affected by changes in temperature and alkalinity. According to the researchers those factors may even have helped evolution to proceed more quickly in such freshwater habitats.

The findings show that the emergence of multicellular organisms may have occurred in more than one kind of aquatic environment not just oceans as previously thought. That may also be good news for the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers on Mars both of which are currently exploring sediments and rocks that used to be at the bottom of lakes a few billion years ago. Perseverance in particular is specifically searching for evidence of ancient microbial life. If life on Earth evolved in both oceans and lakes could the same thing have happened on Mars?

Bottom line: Newly-discovered microscopic “ball” fossils in ancient lake sediments in Scotland suggest that life may have evolved from single-celled organisms to multicellular life in lakes. Until now scientists have thought that this key transition in evolution likely only occurred in oceans.

Findings from the PARADISE-MI trial were presented as a late-breaking study at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2021 virtual Scientific Session.

The study is the first large trial to examine whether sacubitril/valsartan can reduce heart failure and associated hospitalizations and deaths in patients post-heart attack who face a high risk of developing heart failure. Patients taking sacubitril/valsartan were about 10% less likely than those taking ramipril to experience the study’s primary endpoint (a composite of cardiovascular death heart failure hospitalization or development of symptomatic heart failure) falling short of the prespecified threshold of a 15% reduction required to demonstrate statistically significant improvement.

However according to the researchers the trial found sacubitril/valsartan was well-tolerated had a favorable safety profile and was associated with a trend toward improvement in the trial’s secondary endpoints which included cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization; heart failure hospitalization or outpatient treatment for heart failure; cardiovascular death non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke; cardiovascular death and total hospitalizations for heart failure heart attack or stroke; and death from any cause.

“Although we did not significantly reduce our primary endpoint there were consistent findings that sacubitril/valsartan could represent an incremental improvement over ramipril” said Marc Pfeffer M.D. Ph.D. Distinguished Dzau Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the study’s lead author. “The results are encouraging especially when considering recurrent heart failure events and not just the first heart failure events but the study is not definitive. We did notice several aspects of heart failure development that were lessened with sacubitril/valsartan but to investigate these observations would require further evaluations.”

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart becomes too weak or too stiff to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body causing fatigue swelling and shortness of breath. While a heart attack does not always lead to heart failure heart attack survivors are eight times more likely to develop heart failure than those who have not had a heart attack which has led to an increased emphasis on preventing heart failure in these patients.

The PARADISE-MI trial enrolled 5669 patients in 41 countries who had survived a heart attack less than a week before enrolling in the study. None of the patients had heart failure but all were considered to face a high risk of developing it based on a measure of their heart’s pumping ability or fluid buildup in the lungs as well as at least one of eight additional risk-enhancing factors. Most patients were already taking medications to reduce heart disease risk before their heart attack including antiplatelet therapy blood pressure lowering medications and cholesterol lowering medications.

Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive sacubitril/valsartan and half received ramipril. Most achieved the full dose of their assigned medication and kept taking it throughout the trial which had a median follow-up period of 23 months.

The rate of the composite primary endpoint was 10% lower in patients taking sacubitril/valsartan compared with those taking ramipril. In an exploratory analysis of the total burden of heart failure including recurrent events there was a 21% reduction observed with sacubitril/valsartan compared to ramipril. The rate of adverse events was equivalent in both groups with no significant differences in the rates of allergic swelling of the airways (angioedema) abnormal potassium levels renal impairment or liver abnormalities. Patients taking sacubitril/valsartan showed a slightly higher rate of hypotension while patients taking ramipril were slightly more likely to report coughing. These findings offer further reassurance that sacubitril/valsartan is safe to use for patients with heart failure the indication for which it has been approved researchers said. “We found sacubitril/valsartan was as safe and well-tolerated as one of the best proven ACE inhibitors even in an acutely ill population” Pfeffer said. “This trial may not change guidelines but it should make physicians even more comfortable using sacubitril/valsartan in their patients with heart failure.”

The study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

Mavacamten reduces the hypercontractile state of the heart by resetting the myosin heads back to a normal state explained Jay Edelberg MD PhD head of Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy Development at Bristol Myers Squibb.

Data on mavacamten (Bristol Myers Squibb) from the EXPLORER-HCM trial were released earlier today during the session “Health Status Benefits of Mavacamten In Patients with Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Results from the EXPLORER-HCM Randomized Clinical Trial” at ACC.21 the 70th Scientific Session from the American College of Cardiology.

Transcript

Can you briefly discuss the phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM data on mavacamten?

So we're really excited about what EXPLORER did for our patients. We enrolled patients who have the symptomatic form of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and we enrolled 251 patients who were randomized to receive mavacamten or placebo over the course of 30 weeks. What we saw was really exciting.

Our patients had symptomatic functional structural biomarker changes all with mavacamten treatment over the course of a little over 6 months. Their New York Heart Association class improved their patient-reported outcomes improved their exercise capacity as measured by peak VO2 and other measures improved. Their gradients were markedly reduced. Other important parameters improved. Their biomarkers of wall stress and injury all improved.

We're really excited about what this means for our patients.

How does the mechanism of mavacamten work to modulate cardiac myosin and regulate hypercontractility?

So with HCM the heart is basically in a hypercontractile state for much. The engine of the heart the sarcomere has too many of its myosin heads engaged. It's basically working overtime all the time and that leads to hypertrophy and ill effects for our patients. This is due to genetics for the most part. Too many of the myosin heads are engaged.

What mavacamten does is it helps to reset them back to a normal state so the heart can increase when it needs to but is back into that normal state of myosin head engagement. And this translates to our patients by being able to reduce that hypercontractility. Therefore the dynamic gradient is reduced and our patients are feeling better and they're functioning better.

Why is it important to treat the actual mechanism of obstructive HCM vs the symptoms?

So with HCM especially with obstructive forms of the disease what we see is this is a dynamic outflow tract obstruction. We can see this gradient and these symptoms exist at rest. And it can get worse when patients exercise. And so the mainstay of the therapy has really been about preventing the hearts from actually exercising in the first place basically getting beta-blockers to limit the ability of the heart to increase its rate.

With mavacamten what we're doing is we're targeting the cause of the disease with the sarcomeric state which allows the heart to get back to a normal function. And so our patients are able to relieve their gradient and improve their symptoms and improve their function—basically resetting where the heart was. We're not trying to simply mask the symptoms by blunting the heart rate. We’re trying to treat the disease.

What have we learned about mavacamten since the phase 3 results were released last August?

Well what we're reporting here at the American College of Cardiology is the continued benefit we're seeing in our patients here. We'd had good results in the PIONEER phase 2 study and the continuation of those are our open-label extension. With EXPLORER we continued to treat all the patients—those who were both on drug as well as on placebo—in a long-term extension. We've seen that those results demonstrate that our patients continue to get benefit. The symptoms and the overall structural changes the biomarkers are all improved. The effects of mavacamten are durable when we continue to study them.

We're also seeing results of the expanded analysis of the patient-reported outcome KCCQ [Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire] showing all elements of the KCCQ. How patients are feeling have been improved with some patients getting really dramatic improvements. They're demonstrating what we knew: that mavacamten is helping our patients to really feel better. And now we can see that it's actually doing it long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vub3Jtb3VzLXFvbC1pbXByb3ZlbWVudHMtbWF2YWNhbXRlbi1oY23SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Enormous' QoL Improvements With Mavacamten in HCM,"Better health status is what matters to these patients John Spertus says. Here when the drug was stopped they felt worse.

Within weeks of starting therapy patients taking mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) report large gains in health quality with a number needed to treat (NNT) of just five to see large to very large improvements in patient-reported quality-of-life scores.

Tellingly the improvements in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) regress abruptly with treatment withdrawal said John Spertus MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute Kansas City MO) who presented the health status analysis from EXPLORER-HCM at the American College of Cardiology 2021 Scientific Session today.

Mavacamten (Bristol Myers Squibb) an investigational first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor has been designated as a breakthrough therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration allowing for expedited development and review process. Primary results from EXPLORER-HCM first released at the European Society of Cardiology 2020 meeting and reported by TCTMD demonstrated that in patients with HCM mavacamten on top of medical therapy significantly improves hemodynamics functional capacity and symptoms when compared with placebo. The primary endpoint based on two different combinations of peak VO 2 improvement and NYHA improvement or stabilization was more than doubled in the mavacamten group versus the placebo group.

Speaking with TCTMD Spertus called the quality-of-life gain among the mavacamten-treated patients “enormous” making an even more compelling argument in favor of the drug than the primary endpoint given that the goal of an agent like this in HCM is to improve patient’s lives.

“To me we've got the tail wagging the dog where we’re focusing on these surrogate outcomes and not on what really matters to patients” he said. “[This] is why I built the KCCQ long ago to kind of focus on what’s important to patients and that's what these data show.”

New Avenues Explored

As previously reported EXPLORER-HCM randomized 251 patients (mean age 58.5 years) with obstructive HCM to mavacamten or placebo for 30 weeks. Patients were started on a 5-mg daily dose of mavacamten which was uptitrated at weeks 8 and 14. Most patients had NYHA class II symptoms at baseline and nearly all patients were on background medical therapy with beta-blockers or a calcium channel antagonist. In addition to meeting its primary endpoint the trial also demonstrated that significantly more patients randomized to mavacamten met the higher benchmark of peak exercise capacity showed improved postexercise left ventricular outflow tract gradient peak VO 2  and NYHA class from baseline to week 30 as well as improvement in two validated HCM symptom scores.

The health status analysis that Spertus presented today delves deeper into patient-centric endpoints based on KCCQ data obtained at baseline and at 6 12 18 30 and 38 weeks—30 weeks being the end of the treatment and 38 weeks being the end of the study.

As Spertus showed the mean change in KCCQ Overall Summary Score at 30 weeks was 9.1 points greater in the mavacamten group than in the placebo group (95% CI 5.5-12.8). Putting that in perspective “this is one of the largest mean differences of any medication” he said during his talk. Elaborating to TCTMD Spertus observed that while the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have been shown to help improve symptoms function and quality of life “a lot” the average benefit across trials is “less than third of what was seen in this trial population so a really big benefit.”

Moreover in an analysis that attempted to look closer at individual-level benefits a greater proportion of patients taking the study drug achieved a “very large” and clinically meaningful improvement of 20 points or greater compared to placebo (36% vs 15%; NNT = 5) whereas a higher proportion of placebo-treated patients had no change or a deterioration in their health status (23% vs 9%; NNT = 7).

Drug Stopped Health Scores Dropped

Strikingly health status scores “regressed rapidly” in the 8 weeks after the study drug was stopped dipping below the levels seen in the placebo group. By comparison Spertus noted device trials in structural heart disease using TAVI or leaflet coaptation for mitral regurgitation have shown even bigger gains in quality of life. “What we've never been able to do with TAVR or with MitraClip is: we can take away the treatment we can take away the drug and see that all that benefit goes away and I think that's what’s remarkable here.”

Devices unlike many drugs can have that effect because they’re acting directly on the pathophysiology causing the problem and symptoms Spertus noted. Mavacamten appears to be doing something similar although the mechanisms for that need to be further evaluated.

FDA Approval and Price

Spertus hopes that assuming the FDA approves the drug the palpable and profound impact on patient quality of life will boost drug compliance. “They won't have problems with compliance because if people stop taking it they will feel worse” he predicted to TCTMD.

But this also means that the drug’s benefits will likely be confined to patients whose disease is having a substantial impact on their quality of life. This is not too different from what was seen in the ISCHEMIA trial he noted: “If you have no symptoms you can't feel better so if we start expanding [mavacamten] into an asymptomatic population of patients then the quality-of-life benefits are no longer going to be apparent.”

That raises the specter of just how much the manufacturer will end up charging for mavacamten if the potential patient population is small.

It’s not guaranteed to work but I think for a substantial proportion of patients they got an awful lot better. John Spertus

“That's concerning to me” Spertus acknowledged. “I don't know how they're going to price it. The patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that's this symptomatic is not a [large] market so it might be very very expensive.” One possibility worth exploring he said is whether the benefits of this drug are due to better left ventricular relaxation; if that’s the case “that would open up the HFpEF market which is enormous.”

Matthew Martinez MD (Morristown Medical Center NJ) discussing the results following their presentation today asked whether Spertus envisioned mavacamten as additive to other “medical treatments in the toolbox” or more-invasive surgical approaches to treating HCM or as a replacement.

Spertus in response pointed out that this is the largest trial to date in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and the first to have such a “rigorous” assessment of the therapy’s impact on health status.

“Certainly I think before offering an irreversible surgical or percutaneous intervention to decrease the bulk of the septum I would want to try this as tolerated by the patients. It’s reversible and you can always reserve the surgical option—you can’t undo an alcohol septal ablation or undo myectomy—so from my perspective I think this would be something that I would reach for early” he said. “If patients are not responders then I would be trying other [medical] options. . . . And if all of those fail I would be pursuing invasive options. It’s not guaranteed to work but I think for a substantial proportion of patients they got an awful lot better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpY2FyZGlvbG9neS5jb20vY29udGVudC90YXZyLWFudGljb2FndWxhdGlvbi1hcGl4YWJhbi1ub3Qtc3VwZXJpb3Itc3RhbmRhcmQtY2FyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TAVR Anticoagulation With Apixaban Not Superior to Standard Care,"An Edward Lifesciences Sapien TAVR valve during an implant procedure on angiography. There are still questions on how to best anticoagulate TAVR patients and the ATLANTIS study found Eliquis is not a good solution.

May 15 2021 — The anticoagulant apixaban (Eliquis) was not superior to standard of care following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) according to findings from a new trial called ATLANTIS presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2021 virtual scientific session. Researchers found that while apixaban reduced the formation of thrombosis around the implanted valve with no increased bleeding risk a subset of patients taking apixaban who did not have an indication for anticoagulation apart from the TAVR procedure showed a tendency toward a higher rate of non-cardiovascular death a finding researchers said deserves further exploration.

TAVR is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the aortic heart valve through a transcatheter delivery system and eliminates the need for open heart surgery. The procedure carries a risk of adverse events related to bleeding and blood clots and previous studies have offered conflicting findings regarding the best strategy for preventing these complications. Researchers have also struggled to determine the benefits and risks of antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications in patients who require them for managing heart conditions like atrial fibrillation (AFib) that are not related to the TAVR procedure compared with patients who would not otherwise need anticoagulants.

Apixaban is a non-vitamin K antagonist blood thinner that has demonstrated better net clinical benefit than vitamin K antagonists (VKA) like warfarin and antiplatelet drugs in some patients with AFib. The ATLANTIS trial conducted by the Allies in Cardiovascular Trials Initiatives and Organized Networks (ACTION) Group tested whether apixaban was superior to standard of care antithrombotic treatment comprising either VKA or aspirin after successful TAVR.

“Our results do not suggest we can routinely use apixaban as the default antithrombotic treatment after successful TAVR” said Jean-Philippe Collet M.D. a professor of medicine and interventional cardiologist at Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière in Paris France and the study’s lead author. “Although the safety of apixaban is the same as standard care and it better prevents valve thrombosis we observed an unexplained signal on non-cardiovascular mortality among patients who do not need oral anticoagulation. In patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation apixaban compares favorably with VKA on all endpoints and remains easier to use.”

For the trial researchers enrolled 1510 patients at 50 centers in four countries who underwent a successful TAVR procedure between 2016-2019. About one-third of the patients required anticoagulation therapy for reasons other than the TAVR procedure mainly for AFib. Half of this group and half of the remaining patients were randomly assigned to receive apixaban. The remaining patients received standard care which consisted of the VKA warfarin in patients requiring anticoagulation and an antiplatelet medication alone (typically aspirin) in those not requiring anticoagulation.

At one year the study found no significant difference in the primary endpoint a composite of all cause death stroke heart attack valve thrombosis pulmonary or systemic embolism deep vein thrombosis or major bleeding which occurred in 18.4% of those taking apixaban and 20.1% assigned to standard care. According to statistical thresholds specified for the trial these results show that apixaban was not superior to standard care in terms of the primary endpoint. In addition there was no interaction according to the need for oral anticoagulation; however there were numerically higher numbers of secondary endpoints including death stroke heart attack or systemic embolism in the apixaban group compared to the standard care group.

“This difference although not significant was unexpected and driven only by the cohort of patients who did not have an indication for oral anticoagulation and only by the rate of non-cardiovascular death” Collet said. “Among the subset of patients who are in need of oral anticoagulation the results suggest that apixaban may be the default treatment given its ease of use and track record in atrial fibrillation.”

The researchers used 4-D CT scans to examine the implanted valve and assess any evidence of thrombosis more closely. They found that participants taking apixaban had an 80% lower rate of clot formation around the implanted valve. In addition patients with valve thrombosis had a higher rate of ischemic events.

The signal on non-cardiovascular mortality reported in the subset of patients taking apixaban who did not require anticoagulation is consistent with findings from a previous trial GALILEO although the ATLANTIS trial did not find an excess of bleeds as was found in GALILEO nor an excess of ischemic events (stroke or heart attack). Collet said that the absolute number of non-cardiovascular deaths was low in the cohort without indication for anticoagulation adding that these deaths were mainly due to sepsis or acute renal failure and were rarely preceded by minor bleeding events.

“We cannot exclude a play of chance” Collet said.

The study was sponsored by the Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris and funded by the ACTION fund and the Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer Alliance.

Results were simultaneously reported in the Lancet.1

If approved mavacamten would be the first treatment to deal directly with the mechanism behind obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which causes the heart muscle to contract far more than normal and thicken causing dangerous symptoms and sometimes sudden death. For decades clinicians have only been able to treat patients’ symptoms—using drugs developed to treat other heart problems—with limited effectiveness. Patients with obstructive HCM live with physical limitations and fatigue and many undergo surgery to relieve the heart muscle thickening as their disease progresses.

Mavacamten a targeted inhibitor of cardiac myosin works to reduce the hypercontractility which is often caused by genetic variants that put the heart into overdrive. By acting on the mechanism of HCM this novel treatment not only slows the progression of the disease but also helps some patients improve.

The main phase 3 results from EXPLORER-HCM presented in August 2020 during the European Society of Cardiology virtual meeting met all primary and secondary end points and showed significant improvements in multiple measures of patients’ symptoms and cardiac function. double-blind placebo-controlled trial patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM (LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg and NYHA Class II-III) were randomized 1:1 to receive mavacamten (n=123) or placebo (n=128) for 30 weeks followed by an 8-week washout period.

Today investigator John Spertus MD MPH of the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Saint Luke’s MidAmerica Heart Institute presented results from the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). The KCCQ is a well-known frequently used study tool that grades rates patients’ quality of life responses on a scale of 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. When scores improve by less than 5 points a patient’s condition is considered unchanged; a gain between 5 and 10 points is considered a small improvement; 10 to 20 points is considered a moderate improvement and a 20-point gain is considered a large improvement. The KCCQ was administered at baseline and at weeks 6 12 18 30 and 38.

Results for the EXPLORER-HCM patients showed:

The average score for patients taking mavacamten rose quickly and was 9.1 points higher than the placebo group by the end of the 30-week treatment period.

Scales that focused on symptoms and physical limits showed that patients who took mavacamten did not maintain progress after treatment ended.

Among 19 clinical trials that have reported mean KCCQ differences between a study drug or intervention and placebo results for EXPLORER-HCM rank in the top third. Spertus said of mavacamten ""It's really only eclipsed by the structural heart interventions.""

36% of patients taking mavacamten reported improvements at least 20 points higher compared with 15% taking placebo. By contrast 9% of those taking mavacamten reported a declining score compared with 23% taking placebo.

A key limitation that investigators reported in their findings: 28% of patients were missing data at baseline or in the follow-up. Spertus said during the session that this was largely due to administrative reasons and researchers conducted ""extensive analyses of the missing data"" and there were no observable biases.

“This new analysis of the EXPLORER-HCM data provides important insights into the benefits myosin inhibition can have in improving the health status of patients with severe obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"" Spertus said in a statement.

In the Lancet article investigators wrote that one finding stands out: “In particular the proportion of patients with very large (≥ 20 points) improvements in their KCCQ-[Overall Summary] score was much greater than that of patients randomly assigned to placebo suggesting that for every 5 patients treated 1 will feel substantially better.""

The study authors contrasted the effects of mavacamten on patients with obstructive HCM with that of tafamidis “the only other medical therapy approved in the past few years with such a large benefit in KCCQ scores” for patients with amyloid heart disease. While tafamidis “sustained health status” in contrast with the decline seen in patients taking placebo the authors observed that mavacamten brought about improvement in health followed by “the unprecedented complete reversal of KCCQ improvements observed 8 weeks after treatment withdrawal.” The authors noted that this suggested treatment will have to be ongoing.

Spertus pointed out this phenomeon during his presentation. ""What's particularly unique about this study design and using a drug that appears to directly impact the underlying pathophysiology of the disease is we can see what happened after the drug was withdrawn."" he said pointing to the graph where the curve immediately fell below the line for the placebo arm as the effects of mavacamten dissipated.

When treatment was withdrawn ""The health status of the mavacamten-treated patients returned right to baseline and was no different than the placebo treated patients.""

After the EXPLORER-HCM results were announced last year drug sponsor MyoKardia was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) for $13.1 billion and in March 2021 the FDA accepted the BMS application setting a goal date for approval of January 28 2022 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).

May 15 2021 - Transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with a Boston Scientific Watchman device was associated with a low rate of stroke at one year even among older patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) who faced a high risk for stroke or bleeding according to new data presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2021 scientific session.

The researchers analyzed real-world data from more than 36000 procedures recorded in the ACC’s National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) LAAO Registry a registry that includes almost all LAAO procedures performed in the U.S. The study includes data from patients who received a Watchman device in 2016 2017 or 2018.[1]

The Watchman is a self-expanding transcatheter occluder that closes off the LAA to prevent the formation of clots in patients with AF. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015. The device is used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AFib. It is also used in patients who require an alternative to the long-term use of anticoagulant medications. These blood thinners are the primary medical option for reducing the risk of strokes which are caused when a blood clot blocks an artery in the brain but can cause drug interactions increased bleeding risks side effects and logistical challenges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) specify that patients receiving the Watchman device should be at high risk for stroke and unable to take long-term oral anticoagulation.

This study an analysis of a prospective registry of patients who received a Watchman device found that in practice the rate of ischemic stroke (the study’s primary endpoint) was generally on par with rates seen in clinical trials leading to the device’s approval. The findings offer reassurance that LAAO with the Watchman device is likely effective for the patient population currently receiving it according to the researchers.

“Based on these data it seems like we’re doing the right thing” said Matthew J. Price M.D. director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla California and the study’s lead author. “The rate of ischemic stroke was low and supports the clinical effectiveness of transcatheter LAAO as it is currently applied in the U.S.”

Patients in the registry were on average significantly older and at higher risk than those who were included in clinical trials for the Watchman device Price said. The average age of patients in the registry was 76 years; one-quarter of the patients had previously had a stroke many were deemed to be at high risk for falls and nearly 70% had previously experienced clinically relevant bleeding.

After a follow-up period of one year an estimated 1.53% of patients in the registry suffered an ischemic stroke 8.52% died and less than 0.7% experienced systemic embolism.

“I was actually a bit surprised by the relatively low event rates because the patients are substantially higher risk than those studied in clinical trials” Price said. “However all-cause mortality as well as bleeding in the weeks following the procedure were not infrequent — consistent with the co-morbidities of this patient population. This underscores the need to individualize one’s approach to stroke prevention so that patients reap the clinical benefit of stroke reduction.”

The rate of stroke was 77% lower than would be predicted by the patients’ CHA2DS2-VASc scores a measure of stroke risk for patients with AFib. The study focused only on outcomes from LAAO procedures using the Watchman device; future studies are planned to assess clinical efficacy at three and four years.

“By providing more data I think this study continues to support LAAO in patients who are not suitable for long-term oral anticoagulation” Price said. “The apparently low ischemic stroke event rates also provide support for ongoing clinical trials for LAAO versus oral anticoagulants in patients who are suitable for long-term oral anticoagulation.”

Because it is based on registry data the study lacked a control group that did not receive the Watchman device for comparison. However the event rates observed in the study are consistent with those in other registry studies and clinical trials. Price said future research could focus on assessing LAAO in a broader patient population and on outcomes from new devices or techniques for performing the procedure.

The study was supported by the ACC’s NCDR and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.

Ken has been open about his difficult childhood sharing stories about growing up in unstable environments. The ""Thank God"" vocalist and his mother Tabatha Brown often experienced homelessness sometimes living out of their car per The New York Times. “[I] had to grow up a lot faster than a normal person"" he told CBS News in 2022.

Living in a single-parent household Kane’s maternal grandfather — who he shares with his half-brother CJ — helped raise him he told County Music Radio in 2022. “He was my only father figure because my dad’s been in prison since I was a child” he said adding that his song “Pop’s Last Name” is about him.

Kane and his sister Heidi’s father is part Black and part Cherokee which left Kane confused about his racial identity as a child he told PEOPLE in 2018. “I'm biracial; I didn't know that until I was 7 or 8 years old. I thought I was full white” he said.

Aside from rare social media photos together Kane and his siblings are private about their relationships with one another. Heidi and CJ also keep their personal lives largely out of the public eye.

Here’s everything to know about Kane Brown’s siblings — Heidi Swafford and CJ Cordell — and their relationship with their singer brother.

Kane and Heidi have the same dad

Kane and his younger half-sister Heidi (who goes by the name Heidi Monshell Navaeh on Facebook) share a father who was incarcerated in 1996 per The New York Times. Kane was around 3 years old at the time and Heidi was born the following year to her mom Roxanne Dodson.

“[My dad] is a drummer which I didn’t even know” Kane told Billboard in 2018. “He brags about me and talks about how good he is on the drums. I always joke with him and say that I’m going to hire him when he gets out.”

His father’s absence for most of his childhood influenced Kane to become a supportive dad himself.



When Kane and his wife fellow musician Katelyn Jae Brown welcomed their two children (with a third on the way!) he “always knew that I was gonna try to be there” he told host Gayle King on an episode of CBS Mornings in 2022. “I just always wanted to give them the life that I never had.”

Kane and his younger half-brother CJ — who is about three years younger than Kane — share their mother Tabatha.



She often shares photos on her social media of the two brothers including a 2016 Facebook photo of herself with Kane and CJ standing in their living room around Christmastime with the caption “My babies.”

Kane supported his sister during a difficult time

When it comes to his relationship with his half-sister Heidi Kane does not often share details. He did however post a photo with his arms around her in 2015.

“Brother/sister love 💯” he captioned the Facebook photo of them sitting in a booth at Buffalo Wild Wings.



In 2016 just as her brother was earning recognition for his music Heidi made the news herself when she was 19 years old. During a fight with another woman she was stabbed in the neck and shoulder per Local 3 News and the Chattanooga Times Free Press. The injuries were not life-threatening but carried the risk of permanent nerve damage.



The following day Kane posted his concern on Facebook. “Prayers for my sister please! I'm all the way out in Nebraska and get a text that she was stabbed 4 times! ... I'm so sick to my stomach right now.”

Kane is an uncle to his siblings’ children

Before the ""Miles On It"" singer became a dad for the first time in 2019 his half-siblings made him an uncle.

CJ welcomed his son — Brayden Cordell — in June 2012. The following year Tabatha posted a photo on Facebook of 1-year-old Brayden and Kane smiling and looking at each other. “This is such a cute picture” she captioned the post.



According to his Facebook CJ is married to Kristen Brooke Cordell and still lives in Chattanooga Tennessee where he and Kane grew up.

The couple married in July 2018 and have three children: CJ’s son Brayden and Kristen’s two daughters. Most recently CJ celebrated the holidays with Kristen and their kids.



In recent years Heidi also became a mom to at least two children one of whom Kane posted a photo with on Facebook in 2015. “My nephew and I he looks so happy in the picture!” he captioned the selfie of himself and his young nephew.

In her new role Kelly-Brown will be responsible for leading strategic external and internal communications plans for the media giant’s ad sales division reporting directly to ad sales marketing and brand partnerships president Jeff Collins.

Brown most recently served as senior vice president of strategic initiatives for Comcast NBCUniversal. Prior to that she served in various communications leadership roles at NBCU in the corporate communications news and entertainment divisions. Before NBCU Kell-Brown served as vice president of entertainment publicity for Warner Bros. Television.

Brown’s appointment comes as Fox is gearing up for its Upfront presentation to advertisers on May 13.

During its third quarter of 2024 advertising revenue fell $1.24 billion compared to $1.88 billion in the prior year quarter primarily attributed to the absence of the prior year broadcast of Super Bowl LVII and fewer NFL games at Fox Sports partially offset by growth a Tubi.

The ad-supported streamer has reached nearly 80 million monthly active users with 22% revenue growth driven by a 36% increase in total viewing time on the platform. Over 60% of Tubi users are classified as cord cutters or cord nevers and 90% of those users watch on demand content.

While the lack of primary elections this year hurt Fox’s political advertising CEO Lachlan Murdoch said the company expects strong political advertising for national and local races in the fall of 2024.

“Overall advertising trends of Fox are clearly moving in the right direction both in the scatter market and in early upfront discussions” he added. “As we look to our annual upfront presentation next week we are focused on live content and must-watch events such as the coming presidential election cycle and next year’s Super Bowl combined with Tubi’s position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service will favor our enviable position with advertisers across the Fox portfolio.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2JhcnJ5LXN0ZXJubGljaHQtdXJnZXMtYnJvd24tb3RoZXItdW5pdmVyc2l0aWVzLXRvLWdldC1yaWQtb2YtYWdpdGF0b3Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barry Sternlicht Urges Colleges to Clear 'Agitators' at Campus Protests,"Barry Sternlicht who went to Brown University and then made a fortune in real estate said schools should force out “agitators” from campus protests against Israel.

One online reviewer complained last month that their room was ""tired"" with cigarette burns in the carpet a dirty toilet and dust on the lights.

But a weekend stay this month at the property along the Red River costs as much as $429 a night reflecting the boom times that casinos across the U.S. are enjoying as patrons particularly younger ones begin to splurge with the money socked away during the pandemic.

Gambling revenue at the Margaritaville which opened in 2013 more than tripled to $19.7 million in March from $6.5 million a year earlier. Month-to-month the increase was 52% according to Louisiana state records.

What's driving the results is pent-up demand for fun. Limits on other entertainment options such as concerts movies and live sports have helped. At the same time casino operators have gotten smarter since the pandemic forced them to shut down last year. They've learned to get by with fewer employees and are wasting less on the amenities that were money-losers in the best of times.

The fastest recovery has been at regional casinos which guests typically get to by car. Las Vegas heavily dependent on air travel has yet to fully bounce back. Overall visitation in March was still 40% below 2019.

The Margaritaville's operator Penn National Gaming reported a 77% increase first-quarter profit earlier this month. The company credited revenue gains and record margins in some regions.

Casino operators have been able to keep costs low by only bringing back employees when needed and holding back on the customer incentives that used to be one their largest expenses said Chad Beynon an analyst with Macquarie Securities.

""They don't have to give you a $20 slot coupon to get you to come to the property"" he said. ""You have this new customer that generally wasn't in your casino. It's tough to say if that's the stimulus checks or the fact that there's nothing else going on in the country.""

Wall Street is cheering. While the explosion of online gambling and sports betting accounts for a lot of the euphoria driving casino stocks a new industry meme ""the Roaring '20s"" is also at play. Caesars Entertainment the largest operator of casinos across the U.S. has climbed as high as $106 from a 2020 low of $6 in March 2020. Penn National soared to $142 from a low of $3.75 before retreating to around $81.

Visitor traffic is about where it was before the pandemic and spending per guest is up Jay Snowden Penn National's CEO told investors recently. Younger gamblers give him a chance to add names to his customer-loyalty database. And older patrons those 55 and up ""have been gaining momentum particularly in April.""

Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said the recovery is likely to be powerful and enduring.

""If you're thinking this is a short-term situation I think you're wrong"" Reeg said when asked how casinos would fare when other entertainment options return. ""I don't spend a lot of time worrying what happens when we can go to a movie theater or get out to a cruise ship.""

There are even signs the industry is returning to its free-spending ways. Caesars is bringing back the Bacchanal Buffet starting May 20 at its namesake Las Vegas resort featuring delicacies that include heaping trays of crab legs and foie gras PB&J treats.

However not every casino executive is all-in on the never-ending boom thesis -- even if near-term results suggest a powerful recovery is underway.

Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming reported a doubling of quarterly profit earlier in May. Its profit margin in Las Vegas where the company caters mostly to locals set an all-time high of nearly 50%.

""I think the best way to think about margins from our perspective is that look these margins are incredible"" Josh Hirsberg Boyd's chief financial officer said on an investor call. But Keith Smith the company's CEO expressed doubts.

While the recent return of older customers has delivered a nice bump the current level of spending may not be sustainable he said.

""How long does that last?"" he asked. ""Is that a new level of play for all of '21? Is it for a couple of months? I think those are some of the uncertainties.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9wb2tlci9wbGV4aWdsYXNzLWNvbWluZy1kb3duLWF0LWxhcy12ZWdhcy1wb2tlci1yb29tcy0yMzU1MTIxL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9wb2tlci9wbGV4aWdsYXNzLWNvbWluZy1kb3duLWF0LWxhcy12ZWdhcy1wb2tlci1yb29tcy0yMzU1MTIxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plexiglass coming down at Las Vegas poker rooms,"Many rooms have gained approval to remove the plexiglass dividers which have been a staple at tables during the coronavirus pandemic.

Poker players are starting to look each other in the eye again.

The plexiglass dividers that have been a staple of Las Vegas poker rooms during the coronavirus pandemic have come down this week at several casinos after they were approved to return to 100 percent capacity by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The Orleans on Saturday became the latest poker room to remove its plexiglass.

“It is down as of early this morning!” Orleans poker room manager Garrett Okahara said via email.

Poker rooms that have removed the plexiglass include the Caesars Entertainment properties (Bally’s Caesars Palace Flamingo and Planet Hollywood Resort); MGM Resorts properties (Aria Bellagio and MGM Grand); Station Casinos properties (Boulder Station Red Rock Resort and Santa Fe Station); and Wynn Las Vegas (room located in Encore).

The Golden Nugget South Point and The Venetian still have plexiglass in place.

The removal of plexiglass dividers signals a return to normalcy for poker in Las Vegas after it was upended along with most other pastimes by the pandemic.

Casinos reopened June 5 after the initial shutdown because of the pandemic in March 2020 and the Orleans and South Point immediately brought back their poker rooms. The Venetian followed the next day and more rooms gradually came back over the next few months.

Games started with four players allowed at each table under social distancing guidelines then five-handed games were quickly approved. While many poker players returned to action the games were a far cry from the normal nine- and 10-handed tables.

The Bellagio opened a new phase of pandemic poker when it installed plexiglass dividers that allowed six-handed games starting June 18. The other poker rooms quickly followed suit.

Eventually regulators allowed rooms to offer eight-handed games with dividers and that remained the standard until this week.

So far most of the rooms that have removed the dividers have chosen to stick with eight-handed play instead of reverting to the normal nine or 10. The Wynn is playing nine-handed and the Orleans said it would go to nine-handed for tournaments while sticking with eight-handed for cash games.

“Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year” the Orleans poker room posted on Twitter.

Good morning poker players! With the recent removal of our plexiglass dividers tournaments at the Orleans will be played 9-handed effective immediately. Cash games will still be 8-handed for the time being. Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year. — OrleansPokerRoom (@OrleansPokerRo1) May 15 2021

With face masks now optional at many resorts for fully vaccinated patrons poker this summer could look like what it was before the pandemic.

Henderson poker pro and YouTube personality Jeff Sluzinski who goes by Jeff Boski online hailed the removal of plexiglass Friday.

“A timeless moment in poker history” he said on Twitter.

The 54-year-old actress took to Instagram on Saturday to share a super sexy super steamy super authentic PDA picture with her (equally sexy steamy and authentic) boyfriend musician Van Hunt.

In the photo Berry is looking casual and comfy in a t-shirt and tropical-print bikini bottoms (and red heart-shaped sunglasses) while Hunt is equally low-key and casual in a grey hoodie and green pants as the couple embraces for a kiss.

""We do this thing called whatever the f*ck we want ! 💋"" the actress captioned the photo which she also shared on her Instagram Story. Because sometimes you just love a photo and a message so much that you need to share it on your grid and your Story to scream it as loudly as possible to the world.

Berry and Hunt have been open about the importance and impact of their relationship on all aspects of their respective lives.

""In more ways than I can even tell you right now"" Hunt said a March 2021 interview with Entertainment Tonight when asked if Berry had influenced his new music. ""I could show you rather than I could tell you and I will show you really soon I promise. ...The inspiration for our relationship goes across everything even in my parenting. I'm a completely different person I can say it like that and I think that it's improved every aspect of my life.""

In her birthday tribute to Hunt in March Berry stressed the role of teamwork in their relationship writing ""A real woman can do it all by herself but a real MAN won’t let her. Happy birthday VanO. I only wish I’d known you sooner so I could have loved you longer!❤️.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbWV4aWNvZGFpbHlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2NhZXNhcnMtcGFsYWNlLWhvdGVsLXByb2plY3QtaW4tbG9zLWNhYm9zLWNhbmNlbGVkL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vbWV4aWNvZGFpbHlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2NhZXNhcnMtcGFsYWNlLWhvdGVsLXByb2plY3QtaW4tbG9zLWNhYm9zLWNhbmNlbGVkLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caesar’s Palace hotel project in Los Cabos canceled,"The owners of the hotel & casino chain canceled the project due to the controversy that arose around the Estero de San José del Cabo.

San Jose del Cabo / Baja California Sur.- On April 26 2018 Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced the construction of a Las Vegas-style Caesar Palace hotel in Los Cabos.

The work would be in charge of Grupo Questro and it was planned to invest 250 million dollars for the construction of the resort without casinos or gambling venues on the Estero de San José del Cabo polygon.

Caesars Palace Los Cabos would have 500 accommodation spaces between rooms and luxury suites. A convention center of 400 thousand square meters area of entertainment full-service spa three restaurants serving haute cuisine swimming pools cabanas fitness center tennis courts and access to two golf courses of the firm.

The beach land chosen for the construction of the hotel is located one kilometer away from the natural ecosystem of Los Cabos.

In that same month the corporate Caesars Entertainment obtained the construction license from the Los Cabos Municipal Government to start the project.

Despite the fact that the representatives of the global company said that the permit for the construction of the hotel had the authorizations of the local state and federal government in environmental matters groups in defense of the environment of Baja California Sur opposed the work.

The reason? That the Estero de San José area would be harmed by construction work damaging vital mangrove areas and irreversibly affecting the flora and fauna that inhabit this space destroying the Estero Cabeño forever.

El Estero is registered as a RAMSAR site. An international category of protection for wetlands unique and necessary for wildlife. Especially as a migration passage for coastal birds.

Despite the disagreements work began on the site. The Caesars Palace hotel had begun to emerge from its foundations in San Jose.

In Los Cabos and La Paz marches demonstrations and public complaints were published on social networks to prevent the construction of the hotel.

They demanded that federal authorities intervene to begin a thorough investigation in order to stop the possible ecocide that was taking place in the Estero Joséfino.

Countering the offensive Grupo Questro executives argued time and again that the Caesars Palace project would not directly or indirectly affect the San José del Cabo estuary.

The work was being built “at a great distance from the natural polygon – according to Grupo Questro – in no way would the protected natural area be put at risk “.

They were months of confrontations and bids questioning the legality of the permits for the construction of the resort and the negative effects that the disappearance of the ecological zone would cause due to the construction of a 5-star hotel .

The media scandal detonated and the echo caused echoed until it reached the ears of the owners of the brand and owners of the chain of hotels and casinos Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

In a blunt way they decided to cancel the project ensuring that for them the prestige is more important than the growth of the empire of resorts distributed in various tourist regions of Mexico and in other countries of the world.

With orders from above the construction work stopped in San José del Cabo.

The work was finally suspended three years after the directors of Caesars Corporation announced with great fanfare the opening of the first Caesars Palace hotel in Baja California Sur.

Puerto Los Cabos would be the main market for the introduction to the expansion of the Caesars brand in North America .

With the cancellation of the construction of the hotel an investment of 250 million dollars was lost and the creation of more than 1700 sources of employment in the destination of Los Cabos.

protection and card security

Visa and Mastercard both take security and fraud protection seriously. For that reason their Signature and World Elite cards carry fraud protection emergency card replacement and other features that may go above and beyond cards outside of these programs. Let's compare their offerings:

Visa Signature

Traditional Visa cards offer many protections including:

Zero liability for fraudulent charges

Emergency card replacement (within 24 to 72 hours)

Emergency cash disbursement (within two hours)

Lost or stolen card reporting

Some of the cards (but not all) in the Visa Signature line also provide. These benefits are ultimately up to the issuer:

World Elite

Zero liability fraud protection

The World Elite program goes beyond standard Mastercard benefits to offer cell phone protection. It's getting harder to find cards that provide cell phone protection but select Visa Signature cards and all World Elite Mastercards reimburse you for damage or theft to your mobile phone if you pay the monthly bill with the credit card. Some other Mastercard offerings also provide this coveted benefit.

Winner: World Elite Mastercards come slightly ahead thanks to the cell phone protection plan on all cards. However it's important to look at the benefits of the specific Visa Signature card you are considering because some offer more than others.

Travel protections

For frequent travelers both programs shine with the following travel perks:

Visa Signature

Protections offered to all cards within the Visa Signature program include:

Auto rental collision damage waiver

Roadside dispatch

Travel and emergency services

Visa also offers the following benefits on a select number of cards within the Visa Signature program depending on the issuer:

World Elite

Mastercard recently removed many of the travel protections that consumers previously relied on including travel insurance. It advertises nothing of note that would make the World Elite program stand out in travel coverage.

Winner: Visa Signature travel protections are unmatched. If you're looking to protect your travel arrangements in the uncertainty of a post-pandemic era the Visa Signature card will be your better investment since Mastercard comes with little (if any) coverages.

Travel benefits

One-of-a-kind experiences and access to special events are key reasons that frequent travelers covet the cards in these programs. From private jets to free hotel stays soon you'll be able to enjoy these perks again.

The World Elite Mastercard program offers Priceless Experiences offering events in more than 40 cities. Note that many experiences are still virtual now but it's a great perk to take advantage of when you're traveling again.

Bottom line

When it comes to Visa Signature and World Elite Mastercard there is no clear front-runner for which card is better to have in your wallet. Visa offers more protections but Mastercard outshines Visa in other areas especially if you are looking to celebrate getting out of the house with a one-of-a-kind experience in the summer or fall.

You can find excellent credit cards under both programs so it might be best to have at least one card that belongs to each program. Before you apply understand each card's specific benefits package especially when it comes to Visa Signature cards since the offerings vary. Always check with the issuer for a card's exact benefits package.

But in Game 1 of the first round on Saturday night at Capital One Arena the B’s were reminded of just much harder the hockey is come playoff time.

Nic Dowd tipped a T.J. Oshie shot from just inside the blue line and it dribbled through Tuukka Rask’s pads at 4:41 of the first overtime to give the Washington Capitals a 3-2 victory in Game 1. It was a goal that defied physics as it hit Rask squarely in the chest but dropped down and wiggled through the goalie’s pads for the winner.

“I think it was going over my head or at my head and then it hit a stick hit my chest and somehow ended up in the net” said Rask. “I think I probably bumped it into my own net.”

While the B’s were one shot away from winning the Caps were the better team most of the night. They didn’t dominate but the B’s could not/would not create enough scoring chances even when starting goalie Vitek Vanecek had to leave the game in the first period with a lower body injury and 39-year-old Craig Anderson came on in relief. Anderson was beaten only once on 22 shots.

The B’s top two lines were held in check. The David Krejci line was on for two of the three goals against including the game-winner while the top line buzzed on some shifts but in the end did not get the puck to the net enough despite David Pastrnak’s six shots on net. Brad Marchand had one shot on net while Patrice Bergeorn had none though he missed the net five times and hit a post.

“Our top guys didn’t seem to have it. Couldn’t find ice. Give Washington credit. We couldn’t escape pressure on the power-play” said coach Bruce Cassidy. “That’s not typically what we see from that group so hopefully in Game 2 they’re a little sharper.”

The B’s did a good job of staying out the box taking only one penalty while they themselves got four power-plays two of which were drawn by Taylor Hall. But the B’s could only cash in on one of them.

You didn’t have to wait long to know that the playoffs had arrived in this one. In the first couple of minutes of the game Alex Ovechkin lined up David Krejci in the Boston zone for a hit and knocked him off his skates. Game on.

The Caps took the first lead of the series at 6:22 off a bad break for the B’s. Charlie McAvoy had his stick break on a one-timer attempt from the right point and the Caps broke the other way on an odd-man rush with McAvoy left to defend with nothing in his hands. Tom Wilson played a give-and-go with Oshie taking he return pass and beating Rask with a high shot over Rask’s glove arm.

But the B’s evened it up at 13:10 and it produced what could have been a series altering sequence. On a right dot faceoff Jake DeBrusk beat Nick Jensen to a Curtis Lazar faceoff win took a step to his left and beat Vitek Vanecek with a low wrister.

On the goal Vanecek tried to catch up to the puck by doing a split but he ended up hurting himself in the process. He had to come out of the game and with Ilya Samsonov having just come off the Covid list earlier in the day after spending nearly two weeks on it the Caps turned to Anderson.

It was a tough spot for the veteran but the B’s did not make it hard enough on him.

“We didn’t generate nearly enough no matter who was in net” said Cassidy who felt his team’s tendency to overpass hurt them.

The Caps regained the lead at 8:44 on the first off of two deflection goals this one off their one of their own guys. Brenden Dillon flung a shot toward the net that went off Jeremy Lauzon’s stick past Rask as Lauzon battled in front with Ovechkin. Lauzon and Chris Wagner were tied for a game-high eight hits apiece while the Caps held a 51-41 hit advantage.

Though the Caps were the better team through much of the second period the B’s evened it up before the second inrtmission. The top line nearly tied it on a goalmouth scramble but Pastrnak pushed the puck just wide. He did take a high-stick from Dmitri Orlov to get a power-play. On this advantage the B’s kept grinding until they scored at 16:38. Pastrnak’s shot from the left side went off John Carlson then deflected off Nick Ritchie just inching its way over the line before before Dillon could yank it back.

That’s how it stayed until he magic overtime puck somehow made it’s way through Rask for the winner.

Game 2 is set for Monday night (7:30 p.m.) in Washington."

Carnival Cruise Line Goes Global To Select Godmother For Mardi Gras Naming Miss Dominican Republic During MISS UNIVERSE Broadcast

A gamechanger for the cruise industry Mardi Gras is the first cruise ship in the Americas to be powered by eco-friendly Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and the first to feature an onboard roller coaster. As godmother Jiménez will preside over the Mardi Gras' official naming ceremony continuing a long-standing maritime tradition.

Jiménez as well as MISS UNIVERSE 2021 Miss Mexico Andrea Meza will get the unforgettable opportunity to be among the first to sail on Mardi Gras when she begins week-long adventures from the Space Coast to the Bahamas and Caribbean – including the popular destination of Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic.

Born in Puerto Rico and raised in the Dominican Republic Jiménez is a champion for at-risk youth and an advocate for adoption volunteering for the past three years at Los Niños de Cristo orphanage a non-profit foundation that serves abused and abandoned girls as well as serving as a founding member of the Dominican Republic Women's Club dedicated to providing services to indigent women suffering from breast cancer. A survivor in every sense of the word Jimenez and her family were left homeless due to the devastation of Hurricane Maria underscoring her incredible perseverance and a positive can-do attitude.

""Kimberly is a role model for female empowerment and has a passion for so many worthwhile causes particularly those that assist women children and families. It is such an honor to present Kimberly with the 'Spirit of Carnival' award and an even bigger thrill to announce that she's going to be the godmother of our newest ship Mardi Gras"" Duffy said. ""Kimberly joins a group of esteemed women who have served in this time-honored role for Carnival.""

Duffy served on the selection committee for the competition one of eight members of the all-female panel. She said that seeing so many smart and talented women in the competition representing 74 nations was like being on board a Carnival ship with a fleetwide team representing 120 countries from across the globe.

(Marc Lester / ADN)

Cargo traffic through Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport surged during the COVID-19 pandemic with scores of jets arriving daily from Asia.

They brought with them computers cell phones pharmaceuticals and other products in high demand from homebound people in the Lower 48 airport officials said.

Jets headed the other way hauled Canadian lobster Washington state cherries and more airport director Jim Szczesniak said during a recent airport tour.

“There’s the lobster plane” he said nodding to a Sky Lease Cargo jet.

Altogether the airport landed 3.2 million metric tons of cargo last year a 15% increase as e-commerce boomed along the world’s busiest trade route — from Asia to the U.S.

The Anchorage airport’s growth far outpaced the competition making it the world’s fourth-busiest for cargo up from sixth place.

Despite that growth the airport lacks the services of its competitors Szczesniak said.

It’s largely a fuel stop and crew-change site for the jumbo jets headed to other airports.

But a series of projects proposed for the airport valued at $1 billion could help transform it into more of an all-purpose stop for cargo jets he said.

For the first time giant new warehouses would allow any of the airport’s nearly 30 international carriers such as China Airlines or Korean Air to stockpile items for efficient shipment.

As it is now cargo jets occasionally meet on the tarmac to trade products limiting options and requiring coordination officials said.

Another proposal for a cold-storage facility part of a $200 million project could increase shipments of frozen or perishable goods including seafood from Alaska.

FedEx and UPS which operate freight-sorting hubs that move about one-fourth of the airport’s landed cargo also plan large expansions airport officials said.

The projects were announced starting in 2019 as developers pursued leases for raw land around the airport. They are now in various phases of design and engineering he said.

They represent the airport’s most significant chance for growth in cargo services ever he said.

If built they’d provide hundreds of jobs serving as a potential counterweight to Alaska’s struggling economy.

“We are full-throttle trying to maximize this asset to pull (Alaska) out of this decline” Szczesniak said.

A perfect spot

Perched midway between Hong Kong and the Lower 48 the Anchorage airport is geographically blessed for cargo service said Darren Prokop an economist and logistics professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage.

Cargo jets can fly right over Anchorage if they choose he said.

[Curious Alaska: How is the national shortage of car rentals affecting Alaska?]

But they can instead gas up at the airport allowing them to carry less fuel and more of the cargo they’re paid to haul.

That aviation fuel is relatively cheap because the airport is part of a foreign-trade zone administered by the nearby Port of Alaska where the fuel arrives. That means the fuel avoids duties that can boost prices elsewhere said Prokop.

The airport enjoys another advantage over competitors Prokop said. Unlike airports elsewhere in the U.S. foreign carriers can legally transfer cargo between jets at the Anchorage airport. The exemption was secured by the late Ted Stevens in 1996 and enhanced in 2004 he said.

Carriers have been reluctant to take advantage of that. They worry it might be illegal in Anchorage because it’s illegal elsewhere he said. Also it requires timing jets’ schedules.

“Hence the cargo facilities” Prokop said.

If the new facilities are built foreign jets can still transfer product without having to worry about making sure the other jet has arrived. And they can do it more efficiently at more convenient times at the cargo facilities.

Prokop said that long term the airport should see continued gains in cargo because of the strong demand in the U.S. for products from Asian countries.

“We are the gateway city to the Lower 48” he said.

During the pandemic cargo flights from a growing number of Asian cities began passing through Anchorage. To haul products to the Lower 48 faster they bypassed big hubs such as Shanghai or Hong Kong Szczesniak said.

What will happen as the pandemic eases is uncertain.

Szczesniak said he thinks changing route patterns and continued growth in e-commerce are factors that will help supplant the pandemic-related issues that boosted cargo to Anchorage.

“The pandemic has cemented the importance of Anchorage in the global supply chain” he said.

A full-service stop

John Tichotsky a former chief economist for Alaska is a partner in IC Alaska. The company plans to build a maintenance hangar to provide mechanical work for jumbo jets at the airport’s southern end.

The hangar is part of a $500 million proposal that also includes new cargo storage and sorting space. Also 14 “hard stands” would allow cargo jets to fuel up plug into power and transfer freight.

The project will change the airport from the equivalent of a standalone gas pump into a full-service station Tichotsky said.

Lease negotiations for the land at the airport are being finalized he said. The hard stands could open as early as next year.

“I can’t identify anything (in Alaska) that will come online faster and produce greater economic benefit than providing infrastructure at the airport” Tichotsky said.

Other projects are:

• FedEx plans to expand its existing operation by 19 acres building a new center to sort domestic freight part of a $60 million project. International freight sorting will continue in the current transfer center.

• 6A Aviation has proposed building a 195000-square-foot warehouse and six parking spots for cargo jets a $170 million project on the airport’s west side.

• Alaska Cargo and Cold Storage plans its $200 million warehouse off the north-south runway with cold storage.

• UPS plans to expand its existing facility by 28 acres and add space for three big cargo jets a $110 million project.

The UPS expansion will take up much of the northern portion of the airport Szczesniak said.

“This will all be one big giant UPS campus” he said during the tour pointing to a stretch of raw land that extended to a hill.

Construction for the cold-storage project could start later this year officials said.

Beside supporting international businesses cold storage could help Alaska companies that want to ship seafood or peonies said Joe Jacobson with McKinley Capital Management a project partner.

The plan is to capitalize on the traffic that currently exists at the airport. Any growth would be a bonus he said.

“Right now there is unrealized opportunity just with the existing traffic” Jacobson said.

A bright spot

The cargo industry was a bright spot in Alaska last year as the pandemic battered other sectors said Bill Popp head of the Anchorage Economic Development Corp.

Among other benefits to Anchorage it brings hundreds of cargo pilots daily who help fill hotels and support restaurants. (A cargo plane pilot was Alaska’s first confirmed positive case of COVID-19 on March 11 2020.)

Cargo activity is responsible for much of the employment at the airport. The airport supports about 10% of the jobs in Anchorage he said.

Recently FedEx announced it is hiring more than 200 workers to create its first permanent night shift for package-sorting at the airport.

Popp said there’s optimism that cargo in Anchorage will stay strong increasing the odds the projects will be built he said.

Prokop the logistics professor said the new warehouses might one day support new manufacturing businesses in Anchorage. Parts stored at the airport could be assembled into final products that can be shipped elsewhere.

“Ten or 20 years from now we’ll see if this leads to value-added manufacturing” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VvbmUuY29tL2lkZWFzLzIwMjEvMDUvdG93YXJkLW5ldy1uYXZhbC1zdGF0ZWNyYWZ0LzE3NDA2My_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toward a New Naval Statecraft,"Last May as a new Taiwanese president took office the U.S. Navy increased its presence in the South China Sea operating two aircraft carrier strike groups in the area for the first time in more than a decade.

Beijing though not happy about the deployment offered only a muted response. It had its hands full with COVID recovery escalating tensions with India and growing international condemnation of its suppression of the Uyghur population.

The heightened U.S. naval presence not only dampened Chinese intimidation toward Taiwan it had salubrious effects elsewhere…for a while. For example Chinese ships had been harassing a survey ship the West Capella chartered by the Malaysian government for an oil exploration job in its own economic exclusive waters but that behavior diminished once U.S. ships entered the scene.

Now Beijing’s back at it. In just the past few weeks the People’s Liberation Army air force and navy have conducted major maneuvers around Taiwan practicing wartime operations and exhausting Taiwanese defense forces.

Earlier in mid-March more than 200 Chinese fishing vessels Chinese Coast Guard and maritime militia massed in Philippine waters in what could be a pretext for a season of harassment. And once again U.S. and British naval forces are headed to the region.

At a recent hearing before subcommittees of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees witnesses described a maritime Asia at a tipping point. It’s a complicated situation of overlapping maritime claims domestic politics and economics. The question is: What role should the United States play to deter Chinese aggression and lower the chances of conflict?

A window into the future is Japan’s response to Chinese maritime encroachment. Unlike the dynamic state of affairs in the South China Sea Japanese and Chinese maritime forces have maintained a tense balance in the East China Sea.

Since 2012 China has maintained a brisk tempo of air and water incursions around the Senkaku islands—a group of uninhabited islands administered by Japan and protected by U.S. defense treaty obligations. Still China doggedly claims the islands as its own.

Beijing’s aggression has fueled a shift in Tokyo’s diplomatic and military posture. Japan is repositioning more and more of its Self Defense Forces and Coast Guard toward the Senkakus and has consistently increased its defense spending to keep pace with the rising risk. It has also revised U.S.-Japan defense guidelines to enable a more proactive security partnership with the U.S.

What the Senkaku islands and West Capella experiences make clear is that naval presence does matter. In both cases a sustained presence led to a wave of positive regional diplomatic and partner military actions.

However forward presence doesn’t come cheap. Greater investment in our naval forces and operations will be necessary for the U.S. to counter such metastasizing risks and alter Beijing’s (and Moscow’s) strategic calculations.

And yes Moscow figures into the maritime Asia equation. In July 2019 and again last December China and Russia flew bombers together in the Sea of Japan. The two are set to renew a strategic partnership this July—something that will only add complexity to an increasingly stressing global maritime competition for the Navy.

Some argue that the U.S. cannot and should not try to counter China’s coercive maritime actions. This would be a mistake. It ignores Beijing’s long record of encroachment throughout the South China Sea which was greatly expanded and sustained by its ‘island’ building in disputed locations. Beijing’s interest here is longstanding and its approach has been largely effective since 1994 when it erected structures on the Philippines’ Mischief Reef.

China’s intentions are not likely to change. If the U.S. and its allies do nothing to complicate or slow Beijing’s grey zone strategy they risk ceding the global commons of maritime Asia. Inaction would also encourage China to push harder misjudging U.S. commitments thereby increasing the risk of conflict.

A successful strategy must include diplomatic efforts to attract and bolster like-minded partner nations such as India Vietnam Indonesia the Philippines and Malaysia. But soft power alone will not dissuade Beijing nor will it attract the partners we need. So what else can be done?

First presence for purpose: The U.S. and allied naval presence must be prioritized and resourced more vigorously to decisive theaters such as the South China Sea and our deployed ships must be given new tools for grey-zone operations.

Second build a new model Navy: The U.S. must grow and equip the fleet to meet the combined challenge of China and Russia. There is an urgent need to recapitalize U.S. shipyards and build the workforce needed to deliver and man the ships.

Third deliver a compelling cost proposition: This will require rethinking the conduct of U.S. diplomacy building partner capacity and fueling economic development to convince our citizens as well as our partners that they can’t forego investing in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.

All said the dangers in maritime Asia are no longer a distant concern; they are here today and very real. Both the outgoing and current Indo-Pacific commanders Admirals Davidson and Aquilino recently testified as much commenting on the likelihood of China triggering a conflict in the next six years.

To deter the growing Chinese armada arrayed against us requires more than matching numbers in arsenals and fleets. We must grow our fleet while also rethinking naval operations in a wider diplomatic and economic context. We need a new naval statecraft: one that leverages and enables naval presence while demonstrating the economic benefits for a free and open Indo-Pacific.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMTA1LzE1L1dTNjA5ZjE2Y2VhMzEwMjRhZDBiYWJlMDdjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US likely to boost military presence in Indo-Pacific,"By Hu Yumin | China Daily | Updated: 2021-05-15 08:33

The United States has made clear its intention to strengthen its presence in the Indo-Pacific region. While former US secretary of the navy Kenneth Braithwaite has reiterated his proposal to reconstitute the US First Fleet which was active from 1943 to 1973 in the Western Pacific the US is keen on testing the First Fleet's revival as a ""trial balloon"" or ""thought exercise"" to see whether it will help it strengthen its forward presence in the Asia-Pacific region and promote its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China.

The First Fleet can also serve the US' strategy of ""great power competition"" that targets Russia China and other countries. In 2018 the US Second Fleet was resurrected to counter Russia. The Second Fleet has frequently carried out operations near the western border of Russia in the North Atlantic Ocean including the Barents Sea and the Baltic Sea and has had near standoffs with Russia's Northern Fleet and Baltic Fleet.

The Second Fleet coordinated with the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea and the naval and air forces of Washington's NATO allies to control Russia's northern and southern sea routes.

At present the US Seventh Fleet undertakes most operations in the Western Pacific and the Third Fleet in the Eastern Pacific. Considering that vessels comprising the Third Fleet have frequently joined the Seventh Fleet's ""missions"" in the Western Pacific rebuilding the First Fleet would ease the pressure on the Seventh Fleet for conducting operations in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.

The US has built a dense network of naval and air force bases and intensified its military buildup in the island chains along the Western Pacific. It has also urged its allies including Japan and Australia to strengthen their naval and air forces and missile defense systems. And to advance its Asia-Pacific strategy the US has renamed its Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command.

Strategically the US armed forces have expanded their operational zone by integrating the Pacific and Indian oceans in their ""mission"". The US is determined to strengthen its military deployment in key areas in the Pacific and Indian oceans in conformity with Braithwaite's assertion that the First Fleet be placed at a crossroad between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

Since the Ronald Reagan administration the US has focused on controlling the international sea routes in an attempt to block them whenever necessary to further its interests.

And that is exactly what the First Fleet will do if it is reconstituted - it will attempt to block the key routes especially the ""oil channels"" of the Strait of Malacca and the Strait of Hormuz to contain China's rise.

Hundreds of millions of tons of commodities sail between China and more than 150 countries and regions through four sea lanes every year.

The east lane to the Americas Africa and Western Europe through the ""first island chain"" and the Panama Canal and the north lane to Europe through the Bering Straits and the Arctic Ocean are mostly under the surveillance of the US Seventh Fleet.

And the First Fleet if reconstituted will cover the crossroad between the south lane to South Asia and Australia through the South China Sea the Makassar Strait and the Sunda Strait and the west lane to Persian Gulf countries through the Strait of Malacca the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz as well as to Europe and Africa through the Indian Ocean the Bab el Mandeb Strait and the Suez Canal.

After Joe Biden was sworn in as the US president in January the ""freedom of navigation operations"" of the US Navy including aircraft carrier battle groups have increased in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea-they have become more frequent than during the Donald Trump administration.

And at least one of the Theodore Roosevelt and Nimitz carrier strike groups that frequently sail through the Indian Ocean the Strait of Malacca and into the South China Sea will join the First Fleet if it is reconstituted.

When it comes to the rim of the South China Sea thanks to its Changi Naval Base in Singapore Subic Bay and Clark Air Base in the Philippines and Da Nang and Cam Ranh Air Base in Vietnam in the past the US still exercises some influence there. And the US has been inviting countries such as India Malaysia Singapore and Thailand to join its naval drills in order to make them parties to its military strategy.

The Darwin Port in Australia may be a preferred option for the First Fleet Command because Australia supports the US' Indo-Pacific strategy and the Darwin Port is close to the Strait of Malacca and its three alternative routes of the Sunda Strait the Lombok Strait and the Makassar Strait.

But Southeast Asian countries are cautious about establishing closer military ties with the US because the US' strengthened presence in the region may undermine their growing economic and trade cooperation with China.

I laminated my eyebrows (and I'm obsessed),"A crazy-sounding skin treatment that your friend swears by? An all liquid cleanse your mother-in-law is urging you to try?

We've all got a favorite feature. Mine happens to be my eyebrows.



I've always had bushy thick eyebrows (I got called caterpillar eyebrows one too many times in high school but that's a conversation for my therapist not the internet). For years I would get them waxed or threaded just to get stray hairs in the middle and on the sides but I never did anything crazy with shaping them. About four years ago I stopped doing anything to them altogether except for the occasional pluck sesh here and there.

Well that recently changed when I got my eyebrows laminated for the very first time.



To say I was skeptical would be an understatement. I had stopped waxing and threading my brows because sometimes they would come out thinner than I wanted so I just quit - cold turkey. My brows are my favorite part of my face and the thought of going through with a treatment and having something happen to them made me nervous. Funnily enough I've been considering eyebrow lamination for months now (thanks TikTok). So when this story fell in my lap it just felt like fate.

So what is eyebrow lamination?

""Brow lamination is essentially a straight perm for your eyebrows but what it's doing is it's gently opening up the hair follicle so that it becomes flexible and pliable so that I can then reset it to lay in a desired direction"" said Taylor Easton of Salon Tewl in Bellevue.

Easton is a licensed aesthetician and skin therapist. She got her license in 2018 and joined Salon Tewl about a year later in 2019 where she provides a handful of skin lash and brow services. And she's the one who made all my eyebrow dreams come true.

Eyebrow lamination originally stuck out to me because I use soap brow products to achieve a longer fuller more dramatic look when I do my makeup. So when I found out there was a treatment that could give me that desired look and it would stick for four to six weeks I was intrigued. Processing time also varies depending on the client and the brow hairs can be trained over time to possibly go longer than 4 to 6 weeks between treatments.

Don't have huge brows? Don't fret. Easton said this service works for people of all brow types and can give different outcomes:

For thinner brows: Lamination can give desired fullness and help with symmetry.

For thicker brows: Lamination will give added thickness fullness and flexibility in styling your brows.

Here's a before and after of someone who has thinner brows than me so you can get the gist of what lamination can do for different brow types:

Leading up to my appointment



As I said I was skeptical about taking on this story. This treatment was new to me and even though I had read up pretty extensively online I still had some lingering questions — and I sent Easton a lengthy text of them. But hey! She answered them all and my mind was at ease. Here's our exchange:

Abby: My eyebrows are my favorite thing on my face. I just want to make sure that this won't damage them? I used to have hair extensions and they wrecked my hair. I just don't want anything to happen to my brows.



Taylor: Brow lamination will absolutely not damage your hairs in any way. It is a chemical process but the product I use is quite gentle on the hair and by following proper aftercare the health and integrity of the hairs are never compromised.

Abby: I've read so much online and you can never know what to actually trust. I have pretty big bushy eyebrows. I've read lamination is better for thinner brows. Is that true? I want to make sure I'm a good candidate for this.

Taylor: Lamination is honestly for just about everyone. Whether bigger or smaller brows. It's all about customizing it for the person and how YOU want to wear and style them. It's not cookie-cutter or one size fits all which is so great.

Abby: Would I need to get my brows done before? Like I mentioned they're my pride and joy I haven't had them waxed or threaded in years because I'm afraid of someone making them too thin. So I usually just pluck them every few weeks.

Taylor: The service I provide comes with any waxing and shaping and we can also tailor that to your needs and wants. My aesthetic is that of very natural and full brows. I myself have very full brows and always prefer to maintain that with clients' brows as well.

Abby: I use self-tanner also will that be a problem?

Taylor: Self-tanner isn't a problem. You could use it no problem 24 hours after the service. I have clients who self-tan all the time.

After that we set my appointment. To prepare all Easton said was not to use any skincare actives like AHAs BHAs or retinols a couple of days before (easy enough).

Day of my appointment

When I arrived at the salon Taylor met me in the foyer and took me back to her service room. I sat on the chair and we chatted a bit about my eyebrows what I typically do to them and how I like to wear them. Since I have naturally thicker brows we decided to essentially keep them the size and shape they were already but touch up with tweezers to get rid of any strays that didn't need to be there.

She explained the three-step process to me and we dove right in. First up we had the ""perm stage"" where she applied the perming gel to my eyebrows. She warned me that this step has a very strong... aroma — and boy she was not exaggerating. Thankfully I was wearing a mask so that helped with the smell. But regardless? A small price to pay for beauty.

When she was finished applying step one she placed a thin piece of plastic wrap over them and let it do its magic for about 15 minutes and she would remove the wrap to brush them every once in a while.

After that she applied a ""neutralizer"" which essentially sets the shape. Like step one this also sat for about 15 minutes under a thin layer of plastic wrap. And finally the last thing she did was pluck the strays and I was done! We decided not to tint my eyebrows since I have a lot of hair naturally and we thought with how I wear my makeup this would look the best.

When it comes to aftercare here were my tasks:



Do not get them wet for 24 hours

Apply a regenerative cream with a spooly brush for the first 24 hours; then apply it only once each night that follows.

Use conditioner on them in the shower to keep them moisturized.

She also offers maintenance appointments in between laminations which includes any shaping and tinting necessary as well as two types of Olaplex conditioning treatments. This extends the life of each lamination and the integrity/health of brow hair.

Final thoughts

The process itself was pretty simple and the results are insane. I mean just look at them!

I'm not going to lie. I had major mad scientist vibes for the 24 hours prior to washing them for the first time. They looked... intense. But after that first wash and conditioning they plumped back up to their normal texture. When I tell you wherever I brush them they stay I mean it. I can style them straight up for a more dramatic look or I can style them more subtle for a day-to-day look.



As much as I loved them with no makeup it wasn't until Friday when I put on a full face for the first time when I really saw the results. Typically I use soap brow to style and a brow pencil to draw in individual hairs to create a more full look — because of the lamination I was able to skip these steps and still achieve the look I love. Overall I give eyebrow lamination a 10/10. I mean I scheduled my next appointment before I even left the salon during my first if that says anything!

Easton's hours are from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday to Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. Eyebrow lamination typically costs $80 or $100 with tint and includes waxing; aftercare purchased separately. .

Perhaps we felt a glimmer of hope at the end of the 2020 version when an entire generation of ruthless monsters died off in droves and left us in peace. But remember that closing shot of their disgusting furry egg-mass blobs cleverly hidden out of sight? Well they’re hatching now.

If you missed last year’s gypsy moth performance you have a better chance of catching it this season. Unfortunately. Based on egg-mass sampling the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation predicts that areas in central and western NYS which saw moderate to severe gypsy moth outbreaks last year can expect heavy damage this year. NYSDEC’s gypsy moth page can be found here.

Native to Europe the gypsy moth’s range now extends throughout Africa Asia and North America. Its genus Lymantria means “destroyer” an apt designation and its species name dispar dispar reflects the disparate color of males vs. females. It might as well stand for “despair despair” since that’s how many of us feel as we watch tree leaves vanish into the maws of gypsy moth caterpillars.

Their introduction in 1868 was especially tragic as it was deliberate. Étienne Léopold Trouvelot a French artist astronomer and so-called scientist imported gypsy moth egg masses to his Massachusetts home. He thought they could be used to make silk despite good evidence to the contrary and without a thought to their potential impact on New World ecosystems. Glass herbariums were safe but pricey so he raised these fearsome defoliators the woods behind his house. What could possibly go wrong?

Today gypsy moths are one of the most destructive forest pests in eastern North America stripping the foliage off at least 300 species of native woody plants. They prefer oaks but will feed on apple pine basswood spruce willow and when population densities are high enough almost any tree species. In an ironic twist now that EAB is here gypsy moth caterpillars generally avoid ash. Butternut walnut and balsam are typically off the menu too.

Hatchling larvae are black with long hairs or setae. As the larvae grow they molt shedding skins every time they advance to another phase (instar). Later-instar caterpillars develop pairs of raised blue (nearer the head) and dark red (toward the rear) spots along their backs reaching maturity in early July. After a 14-17-day pupal phase the adult moths emerge. The mostly-white females can’t fly from where they emerged and just call out to the boy-moths which are mottled brown using pheromone come-on signals. Mated females lay on average around 500 eggs in a “blob” or mass which they protect with buff-colored hairs taken from their underside.

These oval-shaped egg masses tan to cream in color and about 0.75 x 1.5 inches (19 x 38 mm) can be found tucked away near whatever hiding spot the female pupated in. Very often laid on tree trunks and notably under flaps of loose bark egg masses are usually in sheltered spots but may be just about anywhere. Right now in early May tiny hatchlings can be found clustered on these masses – it’s a great time to seek and destroy.

Natural predators include blue jays robins and catbirds but these have no measurable effect on gypsy moth numbers. The white-footed mouse the primary reservoir of the three species of Borrelia spirochete bacteria that cause Lyme disease has redeemed its reputation: it’s the most important vertebrate gypsy moth control as it loves eating their egg masses. Shrews and other small mammals enjoy hearty breakfasts of gypsy moth eggs too.

More significant agents are weather viruses and fungi. As with the tent caterpillar species prolonged wet cool weather can lead to hatchling starvation and a sudden cold snap in late fall or early winter can kill eggs before the embryos inside can winterize their cells. Cool temps also favor infection by fungal pathogens as explained below.

An endemic soil fungus nicknamed Entomophaga maimaiga for short kills gypsy moth caterpillars as their populations rise. But NPV (nucleopolyhedrosis virus) is our MVP when it comes to knocking defoliator numbers down. The catch is that this naturally-occurring virus usually takes two years to precipitate a gypsy moth population crash.

In addition to egg-mass mashing we can smother eggs that we can’t reach with a shot of dormant-oil spray. This is a very light highly refined horticultural oil. Some people use aerosol non-stick cooking oil such as Pam although strictly speaking this might not be legal. (I promise not to tell.)

Applications of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki or Btk to its pals will protect foliage. Found at any garden center preparations of Btk contain a natural toxin produced by these bacteria. It is highly specific to caterpillars and considered safe for other terrestrial and aquatic life. It must be ingested to have an effect. It does wash off so re-apply after it rains.

Wrapping trunks with a 6” fabric strip and then smearing it with a sticky compound made for the purpose of trapping insects (Tanglefoot and other brands) will trap larvae which tend to commute down to the ground at night and back to the treetops in the morning. A “skirt” of burlap tied around trunks will draw caterpillars to take shelter under the fabric and they can be squished or knocked into soapy water daily. (Caution: the hairs can cause skin rashes and sometimes upper-respiratory irritation.)

Also don’t move firewood! Unless it’s from the woodpile to the house – that’s OK.

Healthy deciduous trees can re-foliate after being stripped of leaves but at great cost to their energy budgets. Pines and spruces on the other hand are not endowed with re-foliation powers. They’re left with only a smattering of green razor stubble with which to photosynthesize; thus gypsy moths can cause such conifer species grave harm. When defoliation occurs in successive years tree mortality becomes a concern.

Don’t be shy about scouring the back yard in the coming days for egg masses to squish and it’s probably a good idea to stock up on Btk before the June rush when everyone begins to notice the caterpillars. Let’s hope there’s no remake next year. For more information see NYSIPM’s gypsy moth resource page.

LANSING — Following defoliation by gypsy moth caterpillars last year across much of the northern Lower Peninsula Michigan residents across the state may start to notice the loss of leaves on oak aspen and maple trees again this year.

Gypsy moths are an invasive species a term for non-native pests that can cause harm to native species and ecosystems. In its caterpillar life stage the insect is a voracious leaf eater. Large numbers of gypsy moth caterpillars caused widespread defoliation in the state from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. A large population in 2020 may lead to more caterpillars hatching this spring in localized areas across Lower Michigan.

Last year defoliation was heaviest in Alcona Alpena Montmorency and Oscoda counties with more localized outbreaks from Manistee south into Newaygo County. Department of Natural Resources forest health experts say it is likely that gypsy moth caterpillar populations will crash in some areas while they thrive in others. Heavy defoliation likely will become visible within the next month in localized outbreak areas and persist through mid-July.

“Gypsy moth caterpillars rarely kill trees in Michigan” said James Wieferich DNR forest health specialist. “Only stressed trees suffering from problems like drought old age or root damage are at high risk. In most cases gypsy moth caterpillars are more of a nuisance in residential areas on houses and in yards than in the woods.”

The leaf-eating caterpillars are hairy up to 2 inches long and have a pattern of blue and dark-red spots. Male moths are dark buff in color and fly; females are white with black wavy markings and do not fly.

Keep trees healthy to help them rebound

The best thing people can do to reduce the effects of pests like gypsy moth on their trees is to promote tree health.

“Water trees regularly and avoid damaging the roots and bark” Wieferich said. “That goes a long way in helping trees fend off the effects of defoliation.”

Mature forests normally can withstand heavy gypsy moth defoliation with little impact. Defoliated trees will begin to develop new leaves in July to replace those that were eaten. Even heavily defoliated trees will recover without serious long-term effects. However consecutive years of mass defoliation will start to take a toll even on the healthiest of mature trees.

Pests were discovered in Michigan in 1954

Gypsy moths were first discovered in Michigan in 1954. By the 1980s and 1990s large gypsy moth populations cycled through Michigan defoliating up to a million acres in some years said Scott Lint DNR forest health specialist. At that time the moths were new to the state and the population grew rapidly without natural control from parasites predators and pathogens.

In 1991 a fungal pathogen found to be killing gypsy moth caterpillars in the northeastern states was deployed in Michigan. This fungus Entomophaga maimaiga proved an effective biological control remaining in the soil from year to year and infecting gypsy moth caterpillars that come in contact with the soil or with other infected caterpillars. Moist soils help to activate the fungus and spread it among gypsy moth populations.

Nucleopolyhedrosis virus is a naturally occurring virus that kills caterpillars. NPV can spread quickly during major gypsy moth outbreaks causing a population crash. This virus also was artificially distributed in Michigan in the 1990s with positive effects.

To determine whether NPV is at work in a certain location look for dead caterpillars attached to tree trunks in an upside-down “V” position. Caterpillars affected by the E. maimaiga fungus also remain attached to trunks but hang straight down.

These natural enemies of the gypsy moth are now well-established across Michigan and are actively reducing populations. To date these pathogens have limited the size and length of outbreaks to just a few years eliminating the need for spray programs.

Variety of ways to handle a gypsy moth outbreak

For residential areas several Michigan counties local governments and/or property owner associations conduct surveillance in the fall to determine if populations are reaching an outbreak level. If treatments are needed an aerial pesticide application will target highly infested areas.

Michigan communities considering a gypsy moth spray program should seek licensed pesticide applicator businesses familiar with the complex pesticide laws including notification and permitting requirements.

A list of Michigan businesses licensed to apply pesticides is available at Michigan.gov/MDARDPABL. Additional information about pesticide laws and regulations is available at Michigan.gov/MDARDPestCert.

To address a gypsy moth infestation in a handful of individual trees homeowners can purchase a spray containing Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki a bacterium that naturally occurs in the soil but can be lethal to certain caterpillars and moths. The best time to spray is when caterpillars are small usually mid-May through early June. If you decide to apply pesticides on you own property be sure to choose an EPA-registered pesticide and apply it according to label directions.

Caterpillars move up and down trees often massing on tree trunks. During this time spraying caterpillars with a mixture of dish soap and water or scraping caterpillars into a bucket of soap and water also can be effective.

First impression – Any tougher it would rust (with apologies to King Gee overalls)

It has a metal exoskeleton frame with countersunk Torx screws rubber-sealed Gorilla Glass front non-slip rubberised textured back and is very solid. It has a rear fingerprint sensor and solid metal buttons including a programmable button usually used for Push to Talk. The only foible is the power button above the volume keys. It takes a little time to develop muscle memory.

Rugged

Screen – fit for purpose

It amuses me when a phone comes with a dark albeit good looking wallpaper that sucks up any brightness. It has about 500nits and a matte screen so it is OK not great in direct sunlight. CAT needs to address sunlight legibility on all its devices and opt for OLED. Netflix video streaming is HD/SDR L3 Widevine.

Processor – SD660 – plenty of power ram and storage

It has 128586GIPs and averaged 124728GIPs with a 7% throttle over 15 minutes. This is amazing given the sealed nature of a ruggedised phone. Geekbench 5 single/multi-core scores are 295/1462 and OpenCL is 569. Plenty of power but not a gamer’s device. 6GB LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB (100GB free) eMMC sequential read/write is 298/188MBps (average – not UFS speeds). USB-C 2.0 external data transfer speeds max out at 30/30MBps.

Thermal camera – cool err I mean hot

I am not going to pretend I know how to use a thermal camera. But as the name suggests it records still and video images and can identify temperature variations and by inference different temperature airflow coming into a home (draughts).

It has FLIR Lepton 3.5 thermal sensor. It can measure from -20 °C to 400 °C. These can blend with 12MP images or with Flir’s MSX technology (Multi-Spectral Dynamic Imaging). There is a fact sheet here.

The MyFLIR PRO app has its image gallery. It can generate PDF reports as well. If you know what it does you will know if you need it. Cat says the take-up by ‘fireies’ has been fantastic as the quality is the same as a dedicated FLIR camera and you get a smartphone for free.

Camera

Less is more – the single 12MP sensor is the same as the Google Pixel 2 3 4 5. Add to that the AI post-processing power of the SD660 and you have a decent daylight camera with surprisingly good low light and macro capabilities.

1X – it was an overcast day – the image is average

8x digital – forget it but 4x (not shown) is perfect

It does not have a macro lens but the main lens will do very detailed shots – great for part numbers etc

No bokeh

Very light bokeh effects as there is no depth lens

There is no night mode but this is pretty good.

GadgetGuy’s take

CAT S62 Pro is a unique device perfect for those that need it. If you don’t need all these features there are other CAT models with indoor air quality sensors laser distance measurement or CAT 52 sans thermal imaging. It is unique so we can’t compare it to other devices but we can say that it (and the rest of the CAT family) is better than the Telstra Tough Max 8.8/10 (and it is not too shoddy either).

Rating

As it is unique it would typically score well as there are no reference devices. As a smartphone it has an average camera battery processor etc. Our review of the CAT S42 scored 8.8/10 and this is similar. But the USP is the FLIR camera and we add points for that."

The owner of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) this month said it will never reopen physical trading pits it shut last March due to the COVID-19 pandemic though a Eurodollar options pit will remain open.

Traders and brokers who work away from CBOT's grain pits found it easier to execute complicated options transactions with help from the floor. The pits also provided a reliable source for options quotes that are not always available in markets that are solely electronic traders said.

Such information would be particularly valuable now as corn and soybean futures are climbing to eight-year highs and markets are gyrating on concerns about dwindling global supplies.

""This is the type of market where you need a human being sometimes to make a market for you"" said Brian Splitt a partner at agricultural research and advisory firm AgMarket.net.

Open-outcry trading was a raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. CME closed most futures pits in 2015 due to the rise of computerized trading although more than 20 products such as Eurodollar and grain options were still traded in pits.

Bids and offers on certain grain options disappeared on the screen when futures prices recently climbed by daily trading limits making it difficult to get a sense of the market Splitt said.

""The pit was always dependable"" he said. ""When things were really wild and you had limit-up moves you could call down to the pit and know what the options were trading synthetically.""

Once futures surge by the daily limit exchange rules prohibit them from trading higher until the next session. Options traders still calculate ""synthetic"" values based on options demand they see.

One of the Reagan Decade’s defining office skyscrapers is about to undergo a more than $250 million upgrade for the post-pandemic era. Changes to 60 Wall planned by owner Paramount Group at the soon-to-be-empty 47-story 1.6 million square-foot tower include a more open portico and heavily windowed façade treatment on lower floors to create transparency with the street and an enhanced ventilation system that utilizes virus-blocking MERV 15 filtration.

But the centerpiece will be a stunning new public atrium lobby to replace the badly dated one installed by original tower owner JP Morgan which later sold it to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche the only current tenant will begin moving to Time Warner Center this year. Paramount will start work on the redesign when Deutsche’s lease expires in June of 2022.

The vast original lobby was never as popular as architects Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo hoped.

Flared-top columns were meant to echo the tower’s Postmodern Greek Revival-inspired facade. But critic Paul Goldberger called it a “cloying mix of white marble lots of trelliswork mirrors and marble grids” that was “oddly frilly . . . Like an ice cream parlor blown up to monumental scale.” It’s temporarily closed due to Covid-19 concerns.

The new look by architects Kohn Pedersen Fox will be clean-lined and verdant with a 100-foot- tall block-spanning “green wall” and a skylight cut through the tower podium. A grand staircase subject to MTA review will connect with the subway station below.

The atrium will “unite Pine and Wall streets” to help “bring the people of this neighborhood together” said KPF design principal Hugh Trumbull. The redesign requires city approval because it’s a privately owned public space or POPS.

A CBRE team led by Paul Amrich and Howard Fiddle will handle leasing. Tenants will likely be able to move in by mid-2023. But the tower must compete for new tenants with nearby FiDi addresses which also are vacant or about to be. Some 800000 square feet will be available at 80 Pine St. and more than 900000 square feet are currently empty at 111 Wall St.

Paramount CEO Albert Behler is confident that 60 Wall’s modern column-free floor plates panoramic views and the planned upgrades will carry the day. “With the reimagining of the building 60 Wall will compete with the best in Manhattan including new construction” he said.

WeWork is still alive and kicking. The flexible space provider which is under new management still has lots of Manhattan office space two years after the ouster of founder and CEO Adam Neumann. Now led by Sandeep Lakhmi Mathrani it’s finding takers for its flexible plug-in facilities aimed at creative and “enterprise” firms that first put it on the map.

At RXR’s 620 Sixth Ave. the Ladies Mile Beaux-Arts style building that’s home to Bed Bath and Beyond WeWork just signed two “cool factor” tenants for nearly 140000 square feet. (The deals are actually subleases since WeWork signs direct leases with landlords and then leases them in turn to space users.)

Cutting-edge software firm Palantir Technologies took 89000 square feet on the sixth floor moving from the Meatpacking District. Separately Current Financial signed for 43000 square feet on the seventh floor. The building has a total 525000 square feet of offices.

Sources said the asking rents were a hefty $115 per square foot. It couldn’t be learned what the taking rents were because brokers either declined to comment or couldn’t be reached. Flatiron sources said a JLL team led by Clark Finney and Howard Hersch repped WeWork on both leases. The sources said that Current Financial was repped by Rob Kluge and Adam Henick of Current Real Estate Advisors and that Newmark’s Michael Morris and Nick Berger acted for Palantir.

A WeWork-watcher who wasn’t involved at 620 Sixth said the leases “show that their original concept still works. They’ve been restructuring leases terminating them at some locations. But these clearly show the continued viability of founder Adam Neumann’s business model.”

In the latest sign that Times Square is coming back restaurateur Shelly Fireman has signed a lease for a nearly 5000-square-foot eatery at the landmarked Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway.

It will be a much larger version of Fireman Hospitality Group’s Brooklyn USA Delicatessen on Seventh Avenue near West 57th Street offering hot pastrami corned beef and turkey reubens plus Roman-style pizza chicken soup and egg sandwiches.

The casual-concept place will be on the West 43d Street side of the building which is also home to Hard Rock Café.

Newmark’s Ben Birnbaum Ross Berkowitz Andre Taub and Jason Wecker were the sole brokers. Levin Management and Rosemark Management repped the ownership.

The four-year contract with Centurion Health will pay an average of about $160 million a year to the company that submitted the most expensive of four vendor proposals The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reported. That compares to an annual $106 million cost the previous four years.

General medical services are included in the contract as well as behavioral health addiction recovery and maternal child health for the nearly 24000 inmates in the state prison system.

The departing contractor Wexford of Indiana LLC bid about $30 million less a year but Department of Correction spokeswoman Annie Goeller said price is only one factor considered.

While the contract award recommendation letter from the Indiana Department of Administration said Centurion had the lowest rating for cost among the four bids it had the best score for management assessment/quality and beat out Wexford in the final overall scoring.

“Our goal is to ensure the care provided focuses on prevention and community accepted standards which we believe will ultimately produce the best outcomes in the most cost-efficient and effective manner” Goeller said.

Wexford received a three-year contract for $309 million in 2017 and was given a one-year $116 million extension. Centurion's contract which is scheduled to be finalized by July 1 is for $643 million over four years.

Wexford spokeswoman Wendelyn Pekich said the company was “disappointed and surprised” over not winning the new contract.

Centurion a subsidiary of Missouri-based Centene Corp. is facing a controversy in Tennessee where state prison officials are going to rebid a $123 million contract the company received for behavioral health services after a lawsuit accused a state official of rigging the bidding process.

The size of Centurion’s Indiana contract apparently exceeds the funding provided by the Legislature in the new two-year state budget. The budget that takes effect in July combined the medical food and educational services line items with a total of $160 million a year.

The Centurion contract alone would be $160 million a year when divided equally although the earlier years of the contract are less. The medical services line item in the previous state budget was $97 million with $36.3 million to cover food expenses and $11.4 million for education costs.

“The contract was awarded after the budget was approved and adjustments to appropriations could not be made” Goeller said. “We are in discussions with the State Budget Agency and are considering options.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Riding the momentum from a blockbuster televised interview the couple made several announcements this week including a new partnership with Procter and Gamble (PG) the same company a young Meghan Markle called out over sexist ads 28 years ago.

The multi-year global initiative was publicized through the couple's Archewell Foundation and is set to “focus on gender equality more inclusive online spaces and resilience and impact through sport.” A financial agreement has not yet been disclosed.

In addition Prince Harry's much-anticipated Apple TV+ (AAPL) series with Oprah Winfrey finally has a release date. On Monday it was announced that the program — titled ""The Me You Can't See"" — will debut on May 21.

Prince Harry and Oprah Winfrey's mental health will tell tales of the ""human spirit fighting back from the darkest places""

The series will see Winfrey and Harry who serve as co-creators and executive producers lead discussions on mental health with high-profile guests including Lady Gaga Glenn Close San Antonio Spurs’ DeMar DeRozan celebrity chef Rashad Armstead and more.

The news follows Harry's hiring as the chief impact officer at San Francisco-based mental health startup BetterUp.

At the moment there are no details on his compensation or employment agreement although the Wall Street Journal reports he will be joining the company’s leadership team as an “officer of the corporation.""

BetterUp which serves over 300 enterprise businesses including Hilton NASA Chevron Mars Genentech Snap Inc. and Warner Media raised $125 million in its latest funding round — valuing the company at an impressive $1.73 billion.

BetterUp's growth means there's more wealth for Prince Harry to share in putting him further down the road toward financial independence.

In addition to BetterUp Harry also took on a six month role as a commissioner for the leading non-profit Aspen Institute's new Commission on Information Disorder. Journalist Katie Couric Color of Change president Rashad Robinson and the Former Director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs all serve as co-chairs of the agency. It is unclear whether Harry will be paid for the part-time gig.

And then there are the couple's media and investment deals.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle inch closer to building $1 billion brand

In December the Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed a 3-year podcast deal with Spotify (SPOT) for an estimated $15 million - $18 million. That same month Markle invested an undisclosed amount in the powdered oat milk latte startup Clevr Blends — her first public personal investment according to Fortune.

Still it was their 5-year Netflix (NFLX) deal that's generated the most buzz with multiple reports saying the deal could be valued at up to $100 million.

Combined with the duo's various speaking appearances which are reported to go for around $1 million the couple is poised to build a $1 billion brand as mental health advocates content creators and venture capitalists.

Financial Impact of Royal Departure

The couple's polarizing departure from the House of Windsor may in fact be fueling interest in the couple's mushrooming business ventures. Yet with the prince relinquishing his royal duties it's unclear how much — if anything — he'll continue to receive from the royal family.

Before their new spate of deals the couple's combined net worth stood at $10 million according to Forbes with a sizable portion lying in the equity of their nearly $15 million California mansion. For context Queen Elizabeth II is worth an estimated $500 million.

Prince Harry inherited roughly $10 million from his late mother Princess Diana's estate with Meghan Markle contributing approximately $2 million (after taxes) from her various works as an actress.

The Sovereign Grant funded in part by British taxpayers previously contributed 5% to the couple’s total income. It is currently used to finance and support the official duties of the Queen including travel security staff and building upkeep.

The remaining 95% of their income came from the Duchy of Cornwall a private estate account maintained by Prince Charles. The estate is valued at roughly $1.2 billion with Prince Charles receiving approximately $28.3 million to distribute amongst his family.

At the time the company had more than 2300 locations around the globe all sprouting from one tiny shop that opened near the University of Denver campus in 1993. It went through some rough years following a major E. coli outbreak in 2015 setting in motion events that led to the relocation but Chipotle’s meteoric rise gave it status as an iconic Colorado-based restaurant brand.

Three years after Chipotle’s departure Colorado hasn’t fallen off the quick-service restaurant map. If anything the state’s continued strong population and economic growth and food innovation have made it a better launching pad for ambitious brands with their sights set on taking their concepts regional national or even global experts say.

And despite what Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said about needing to relocate to Southern California to find talent restaurant executives in Colorado say they are finding the people they need to help them chase their goals.

“There is a lot of talent that is really interested in working with an aggressively growing company in the Denver market” Michael Haith owner and CEO of Teriyaki Madness a company with plans to expand to 500 locations over the next handful of years.

When HG Parsa looks at Denver he sees all the ingredients needed for a vibrant restaurant industry and broader business community. Those include a diversified economy one of the world’s premier international airports and land prices that are still a bargain compared to major markets on the coasts. Labor is scarce right now but the University of Denver hospitality professor believes the labor pool is here.

“Denver has all the potential to be the next great city like Dallas; plenty of land a busy airport” Parsa said. “And what we have what nobody else has: mountains.”

With 15 years of experience in the restaurant industry including working as a regional training manager for Wendy’s overseeing 35 locations Parsa said what encourages him about Denver’s place in the quick-service restaurant ecosystem is all the brands that are choosing to create a footprint here. Not just In-N-Out Burger either but other brands like Austin Texas-based Torchy’s Tacos.

As far as being a hub for growing chains Parsa said being home to a company headquarters is good for the commercial real estate market and people who fill white-collar roles like lawyers and real estate professionals. But for him the ultimate measure is how many chains get started here.

“Starting here means it’s fertile land” Parsa said.

Teriyaki Madness may not have started in Denver — it was launched in Las Vegas in 2003 before moving its corporate headquarters in 2014 — but its owner and CEO Haith knows a thing or two about building food services businesses at a mile about sea level.

The Cherry Creek High School graduate founded Pour La France! Catering a corporate catering business in Denver in 1989. He sold the business in 2015.

Haith originally invested in Teriyaki Madness because he was attracted to the food: healthy customizable Asian cuisine. But he also admired its simple business model and strong profitability. He sold all his other companies before buying out founder Rod Arreola and his family in 2016 immediately shifting his focus to building out the technology stack to power Teriyaki Madness’s growth.

Five years later the company has 103 locations including one in Mexico City and eight along the Front Range. The company’s first two Canadian locations should open in the next few weeks Haith said.

Aided by an app that allowed for easy curbside pickup third-party delivery services and food that travels well Teriyaki Madness thrived during the pandemic Haith said. It’s a trend that hasn’t let up in 2021. Year-to-date same-store sales are up 32%.

For Haith it all comes down to talent and Denver is a hotbed for it. His company may have benefitted from going into expansion mode just as other established restaurant brands in Denver — like Chipotle Qdoba Mexican Eats and Quiznos — were either moving their headquarters or be taken over by new ownership.

“My timing was just perfect where I was getting all these people that didn’t want to move to San Diego or wherever the brands were going” he said. “Suddenly I was talking to these veterans with 20 years under their belts that really wanted the adrenalin rush of working for a fast-growing company.”

Teriyaki Madness only owns one of its locations a store near Denver Union Station that has struggled during the pandemic Haith said. It is focused on franchising in suburban areas. That’s a strategy that has paid off with more people staying close to home over the last year.

Tim McCurry and his sister Erin Brueggeman co-own the Teriyaki Madness that opened last February in Firestone just off the Interstate 25 Colorado 119 interchange. The pandemic meant the store got off to a rocky start with sales falling 30% below their grand opening totals but since then business has taken off McCurry said.

“We were the fastest store in the history of Teriyaki Madness outside of Vegas to hit a million dollars in net sales” said McCurry who lives just a few minutes from the restaurant. “We pride ourselves on being part of this community and I think because of that it brought the local community out to support this business.”

McCurry and co. are reinvesting what they made in Year 1 back into their franchise agreement aiming to open a second location in western Longmont this summer. A third shop possibly in Brighton could follow within the next year he said.

“I think their business model is really what got me knowing they have all these systems in place” McCurry said of becoming a Teriyaki Madness franchisee. “If you want to invest and build a legacy for your family you buy a franchise and get an instruction manual and you can build a successful business.”

It’s not at Teriyaki Madness’s level yet but as Birdcall prepares to make its out-of-state debut this year with two locations in Arizona CEO Peter Newlin is optimistic about the company’s trajectory.

Debuting in the Five Points neighborhood in 2017 the natural products-focused chicken sandwich chain opened its fourth store in Colorado Springs earlier this year. Four or five more could open before the end of 2021 Newlin said. The company is scouting locations in the Dallas area and aims to open a store there early next year.

“We’ve got an amazing Denver-based investor group that’s just focused on continuing to build Birdcall into something super unique” Newlin said. “Our goal is to get up to 20 openings a year by 2023 2024.”

Newlin launched the company with chef Philippe Failyau. The two met while Newlin was a grad student at the University of Denver who frequented Failyau’s Park Burger restaurant near the campus. The partners and their companies — Birdcall and restaurant company Gastamo Group — benefitted from lessons learned through EatDenver the nonprofit membership organization dedicated to supporting independent restaurants in the city Newlin said.

“It’s a place to share stories or hear from industry-leading people. More importantly I viewed it as a place to find mentorship” Newlin said mentioning getting to learn from executives with brunch chain Snooze an A.M. Eatery. “People say “Hey why do all these restaurant groups come from Colorado?’ and I run it back to the community.”

Even idiosyncratic Cheba Hut Toasted Subs reaps the benefits of Denver’s gravitational restaurant chain pull despite being located more than an hour north of the metro area in Fort Collins.

The marijuana-themed sandwich chain launched in Arizona in 1998 before setting down some more permanent roots in Larimer County in 2014 has been growing by about 30% in each of the last four years. It opened seven stores in six new markets last year despite the pandemic CEO Marc Torres says and now has 39 stores spread across more than a dozen states.

The company is debt-free and choosy about who it brings in as a franchise partner so its growth aims are in the 10 to 15 locations per year range for the foreseeable future Torres said.

Putting an emphasis on company culture (including regular after-work “sessions”) and being in the building at least four days a week at company HQ Torres says recruitment can be tough in Fort Collins. But Cheba Hut feels strongly it offers a culture worth relocating or commuting for. Denver is a key recruitment market.

“We’re well connected to the other franchisors in Denver and we’re constantly talking with them especially during the pandemic” Torres said. “I think that we have a lot of common challenges and opportunities so while we’re maybe not able to directly connect with them in person all the time we maintain the relationships as best as possible.”

If there is a deficiency in what Denver offers growing restaurant companies it’s the lack of a formal culinary school with Johnson & Wales University preparing to shut down its campus in the city this summer HG Parsa the DU professor said. Still he expects the area to remain a ripe ecosystem especially with the natural and healthy food innovations coming out of Boulder County.

“Plant-based foods are the future and they’re here” Parsa said. “All kinds of more up-and-coming foods are happening here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaXRlbS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9jaGlwb3RsZS1idXJsaW5ndG9uLXRvLW9wZW4tdGhpcy1zdW1tZXItaW4tc3VtdGVyLDM2NDEzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chipotle Burlington to open this summer in Sumter,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://theitem.com/stories/chipotle-burlington-to-open-this-summer-in-sumter,364130 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaXRlbS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9jaGlwb3RsZS1idXJsaW5ndG9uLXRvLW9wZW4tdGhpcy1zdW1tZXItaW4tc3VtdGVyLDM2NDEzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdvcmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNS9uZXdzL2Jhbmdvci8zcmQtcmVjcmVhdGlvbmFsLXBvdC1zaG9wLW9wZW5zLWluLWJhbmdvci1vbi1zdGlsbHdhdGVyLWF2ZW51ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3rd recreational pot shop opens in Bangor on Stillwater Avenue,"Bangor’s third recreational cannabis retail shop opened on Friday less than a mile down the road from the city’s second shop which opened this winter.

Theory Wellness a Massachusetts-based cannabis dispensary with recreational shops in Waterville and South Portland and two recreational shops in Massachusetts opened on Friday at 569 Stillwater Ave. in the same development as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Sport Clips.

Thomas Winstanley Theory’s director of marketing said the company’s rapid expansion into Maine — with three stores since the state allowed recreational marijuana sales last fall — is due to founders Brandon Pollock and Nick Friedman having deep ties to the state as both graduated from Colby College. The company has also opened a production facility in the state with a large growing operation now in Waterville that supplies its three Maine shops.

“We love Maine. And we love the active lifestyle here. We think cannabis goes really well with a lot of those outdoor activities” Winstanley said.

The Bangor shop will sell traditional marijuana (“flower”) as well as pre-rolls vaporizers concentrates edibles tinctures and accessories. For its first weekend open Theory Wellness will donate 25 percent of its sales to the Bangor Farmers Market to support its efforts to connect low income families in the Bangor area with locally-grown food.

Theory Wellness joins Brothers Cannabis as the second recreational shop on Stillwater Avenue. In February Brothers owned by Maine brothers Greg and Matt Hawes opened at 469 Stillwater Avenue in the same development as Hobby Lobby and Buffalo Wild Wings. The two stores are less than a half-mile from each other.

Winstanley said there’s plenty of room for more retail shops in the Bangor area and in Maine in general as the cannabis industry grows.

“Our focus is definitely inward and on running the best operation possible” he said. “Ultimately there is room for everybody. This is definitely a growth industry. And the more shops that open the better because that means the demand is there.”

According to Maine’s Office of Marijuana Policy there were $2.5 million in recreational marijuana sales in the state in January 2021 a 92 percent increase from sales in November 2020 which was the first full month of recreational sales.

While Theory Wellness’ core audience is cannabis consumers under the age of 35 Winstanley said they are always surprised by the diversity of people that come through the doors of their other Maine stores.

“We have had a little old lady 80 years old walk in and ask for a pre-roll of Dank Sinatra” he said referring to a particular cannabis strain. “I think there are a lot of people who have never used before or who haven’t used since the 60s who are trying it out. The audience is growing and changing and maturing. It’s fascinating to watch.”

The first recreational shop in Bangor Firestorm located at 1172 Outer Hammond St. opened on Oct. 9 2020 the first day that recreational sales were allowed in the state of Maine. Owned by Bangor-area natives Moe Ibrahem and Salvatore Fero Firestorm grows its cannabis at a separate facility Allure Cultivation located just down the road from the retail storefront.

According to Bangor’s department of code enforcement a fourth recreational shop has received permits to open at 599 Broadway and is currently under construction.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTM0MDAwMDcvT3VyLUxhZHktTG91cmRlcy1DaHVyY2gtQ2hpY2Fnby1jaHVyY2gtZGVtb2xpdGlvbi5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzQwMDAwNy9hbXAvT3VyLUxhZHktTG91cmRlcy1DaHVyY2gtQ2hpY2Fnby1jaHVyY2gtZGVtb2xpdGlvbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stunning 125-year-old Catholic church faces the wrecking ball after parishioners struggled to raise $2m for re,"A historic Catholic church faces imminent demolition if its parishioners aren't able to raise $2 million for repairs and maintenance.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solid Rock Church leaders report harassment amidst controversy over Mica Miller's death,"Leaders at Solid Rock Church filed a police report last week with concerns about an influx of ""harassing"" messages in the wake of one of its pastor's wife's death.

A pastor at Solid Rock Church filed the complaint with Myrtle Beach Police Dept. on May 1 regarding a slew of social media posts and messages directed at the church following 30-year-old Mica Miller's passing.

Mica's estranged husband John-Paul Miller is a pastor at Solid Rock. Mica was also an active member of multiple ministries within the church.

On May 1 four days after Mica died by suicide in Robeson County the complainant who is listed in the police report as one of the pastors at Solid Rock told police she and the church received multiple Facebook messages and emails in the days following Mica's death. The responding officer was shown multiple posts and messages that were sent to the complainant and the church. The report said there were no direct threats of violence in the messages.



TOP STORY:

Police said the posts are vague about ""canceling"" and ending the church for ""its lies."" The report added that certain Facebook groups and TikToks have been shared about the church in hopes to ""end them."" No direct person is being harassed.

Pastor John-Paul was reportedly not on the scene to meet with officers.

All of the information gathered was passed on to direct supervisors and police concluded there was no harassment at that time the report concluded.

""It just feels really exciting because you know that everything is gonna go perfectly fine 'cause everyone knows their part"" 11-year-old Emelina said Tuesday evening before rehearsal at Central United Methodist Church in Phoenix.

Emelina's chorus made up of more than 350 children between kindergarten and 12th grade is now at risk of being silenced. Just days away from a concert celebrating its 40 years Phoenix Children's Chorus has been left looking for a home after Central United Methodist Church voted last month to close down.

The move by the church located on North Central Avenue near East McDowell Road is leaving the choir without offices rehearsal space and a fixed performance venue.

The unexpected development came after the chorus left the Phoenix Center for the Arts a year ago following 39 years there and only a few weeks since a three-year lease at the church was secured according to Managing Artistic Director Troy Meeker.

""It was just such a heartbreaker"" Meeker said about learning of Central United Methodist closing. ""This was a space where we could grow.""

Meeker 43 has been with the choir since he became its conductor in 2011. He took on his current duties in 2019.

Central United Methodist Church is shuttering after more than 150 years since its founding and 74 years at its current mission-style structure. The church's pastor Rev. Brandon Gilmore 47 was dismayed by the development while pointing to a struggle to meet funding and attendance needs.

""The history of Central had been in decline. A lot of people felt that it was like watching the Titanic sink. It was just a matter of time"" Gilmore said in an April 25 interview with The Arizona Republic.

Central United Methodist's closure will be finalized in the summer according to the church's regional conference.

The chorus's uncertain fate appeared far from the child performers' minds during rehearsal.

About 200 children in a rainbow of red yellow green blue and purple T-shirts hit high notes as they sang ""Why We Sing"" the power ballad the choir performs annually at their end-of-season concert. Meeker was quick to point out to the young singers the areas where they needed improvement. He reminded the children to remain focused during their performance Saturday at Phoenix's Dream City Church.

The concert will be among the 20-30 Emelina has sung in since joining the Phoenix Children's Chorus in 2018 when the freckled red-haired girl was 6. Her sister Dagney 13 and her brother Owen 7 are also part of the chorus. Their mom Laura Hauf 41 is a former educator who homeschools them in the West Valley. She was happy to discover the Phoenix Children's Chorus as a reputable place to musically enrich her children.

""What drew me to Phoenix Children's Chorus was their history. They've been around forever"" Hauf said.

An ever-present smile quickly fades from Hauf's face as she ponders a future for her children that does not include the Phoenix Children's Chorus.

""My kids would be devastated"" Hauf said. ""They don't want to give up what they've built.""

Barry refuses to help Nora track the elemental forces for two if not three reasons: 1. elemental forces cannot essentially be destroyed by just killing its conduits 2. Killing conduits equals murder and 3. That’s just against Team Flash’s tenets. But Nora tries to convince them saying these forces will eventually concoct chaos in this world if not stopped now. Following this heated argument Nora takes off on her solo mission.

And after discovering that Team Flash unintentionally birthed three elemental forces in addition to the Speed Force Cisco backtracks to the day of the revival to prove the energy signatures matching these conduits’ multiversal particles did in fact originate from that day. This further instills in Barry the idea of time travel being the default solution.

Despite all the taboo around it at S.T.A.R Labs and that this time he might even lose his powers the Team votes for it. Talk about recycling stories! Iris doesn’t agree with his idea nor does Cisco but Chester decides there’s no other way. The three men also vote to bring back Dr. Harrison Wells/Timeless Wells (insert googly eyes) from the pre-particle accelerator explosion since he’s the obvious source for expert advice on multiversal particles.

Just when the Team finishes modifying the tachyon collector (first appears in The Flash season 1 episode 9 “The Man in the Yellow Suit”) to work as a multiversal particle collector Deon Owens/Still Force pops out of nowhere and realizes what they were up to if the Team succeeds in collecting those particles the night of the Speed Force rebirth the other forces will cease to exist. Deon ages the collector but doesn’t do anything to the core that Chester hid before Deon figured out everything. Meanwhile Caitlin monitors Alexa’s corpse for anything out of the ordinary that may help bring her back to life.

So Team Flash is now working in two: Wells and Barry travel to the day of speed force rebirth as Iris Allegra and Kamilla venture into Barry’s old house in hopes of finding Nora. Instead they tumble into Psyche (there’s no explanation why he’s there?) who attacks the three without any reason.

Barry manages to collect the particles but is unable to stop the forces themselves from being generated. That’s when he realizes Iris Cisco and everyone else was right and that an elemental force cannot be stopped so he breaks the collector and releases the particles thus saving Deon Alexa and Psyche.

This is also the moment when past Wells nods at someone/something during the Speed Force rebirth in episode 3 “Mother” and it turns out to be the time-travelling Wells helping Barry!

Barry and Iris reconcile after his return and realize they can jumpstart Alexa and so they do. Apparently she was just too weak to heal and needed an external generator to tap into. Wells makes way to his own time i.e. to the time when his wife is still alive. Before he leaves he affirms that love transcends everything which might be the reason for his decision to leave Central City. With Wells Frost and Cisco out of the picture Team Flash is now severely understaffed and it’s about to get worse.

The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the Phillies from having a 40-year reunion and it will not take place this season either. Read more

The greatest loss of the Phillies’ pandemic-shortened 2020 season was not the one in Miami on the final day of the season that deprived them of a chance to end their playoff drought. Let’s face it even if they got in they were going to be an easy first-round out for a Los Angeles Dodgers team that was on a mission to end its own 31-season drought without a World Series title.

A far greater setback for the Phillies was the missed opportunity to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1980 World Series team which in this writer’s opinion remains the greatest moment in franchise history and one of the most underrated championship stories in baseball history.

Sadder still is that we’re going to have to wait at least one more year for all the players from that team to gather for a reunion at Citizens Bank Park.

“It’s very important to us” Phillies executive vice president David Buck said. “We can’t do it this year. Until last week we didn’t know when we’d be able to go full capacity and we just ran out of time from a planning standpoint. But it’s really important to us that we celebrate these guys.”

» READ MORE: The day the Phillies won the 1980 World Series

One member of that 1980 World Series team will be honored during the first weekend of August when the Phillies play host to the New York Mets. Manny Trillo the MVP of the Phillies’ riveting five-game NLCS win over the Houston Astros will be inducted onto the team’s Wall of Fame and plenty of his former teammates are sure to be in attendance. His induction was also prevented from happening last year because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Trillo will be the 11th member of the 1980 team placed on the Wall of Fame joining players Steve Carlton Mike Schmidt Larry Bowa Greg Luzinski Tug McGraw Garry Maddox Bob Boone and John Vukovich. The late Paul “The Pope” Owens the general manager of the team and the late Dallas Green the manager are also of the Wall of Fame.

All living members on the Wall of Fame are always invited to the induction ceremony but it’s important that a complete celebration of the team takes place because the story of the 1980 Phillies is a great one and the cast of characters extends beyond the core that is mentioned above.

“It is important for it to happen” Buck acknowledged. “We’re just not sure when.”

The sooner the better for one obvious reason: the majority of players from the 1980 team are 70 or older. In the last five years Green and four of his coaches — Ruben Amaro Sr. Billy DeMars Mike Ryan and Herm Starrette — have died. Utility infielder Ramon Aviles was removed from the roster of living players last year joining Nino Espinosa McGraw and Vukovich.

“We are the first ones who ever won it” said Bowa the shortstop on the 1980 team. “We’re all getting up in years and some of us have passed away just in the last year. I think it is something a lot of fans want to see.”

» READ MORE: Whatever happened to Phillies' 1980 World Series ball?

Full disclosure: As a senior in high school I was in love with the 1980 Phillies. It was actually a long-term relationship that had started in the early 1970s as Bowa Schmidt Luzinski and Boone came through the farm system while Carlton McGraw Maddox Trillo and Bake McBride came over in masterful trades made by The Pope.

“That was just a really really good team” Buck said. “They were special to me. That’s for sure.”

A quartet of Phillies actually had a small reunion in March when they gathered at Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater Fla. The group consisted of Bowa Pete Rose Luzinski and Boone. Lee Elia the third-base coach was in the audience.

“It was fun just to relive that world championship because it meant so much to so many people” Rose said. “The most awesome sight I ever saw in my life was that parade. We had parades in Cincinnati but nothing like that.”

Bowa said the banter at the Clearwater event was entertaining.

“Baseball minds are funny” Bowa said. “They remember everything that happened. The big hits. Pete running through a stop sign. Us getting behind in the first game of the World Series. But the biggest topic was the ball off Boonie’s glove. Boonie says ‘Look where I ran to and where Pete came from and tell me whose ball that was.’ We laughed so hard.”

There are so many stories to be told about the 1980 Phillies and truth be told their place in baseball history has been shortchanged.

That team needed to overcome ghosts from the franchise’s past that rivaled the romanticized failures of the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. The Red Sox went 86 years from 1918 until 2004 between World Series titles and the Cubs went a record 108 years between their 1908 and 2016 titles.

It took the Phillies 97 years to win their first title and the amount of bad baseball and broken hearts by that point had stockpiled like cars in a junk yard. The Phillies had endured 14 100-loss seasons which remains tops in the National League and the most for a team that has remained in the same city throughout the history of its franchise.

The Athletics are the only franchise with more 100-loss seasons at 16 and 11 of those came while they were still playing in Philadelphia.

The Phillies of course also had to deal with the horror of 1964 a collapse so monumental that it still haunts the fans who remember it to this day.

“When you joined the Phillies you were sure to know about the 1964 season within your first two months of being there” Bowa said. “It felt like it was written about every day. You knew about Gene Mauch using only two starters and the Chico Ruiz steal of home.”

By 1980 three straight playoff failures and manager Danny Ozark’s job had been added to the tab. Black Friday had become part of the lexicon that described nearly a century of discontent and an antsy owner had given the core an ultimatum during spring training.

“We played that whole year with a chip on our shoulder” Bowa said. “Ruly Carpenter was a great owner but he told us he was going to break up the team if we didn’t get over the hump and get to the World Series. He told us that before the season started.”

The playoffs actually started in the regular season for the Phillies. They traveled to Montreal on the final weekend tied for first place with the Expos. A two-run homer by Schmidt and two perfect innings by McGraw gave them a 2-1 win in the first game. The following night Boone tied the game in the ninth inning with a two-out single. Schmidt launched a two-run homer in the 11th and McGraw pitched three more scoreless innings.

“I do think our title is underrated considering what we had to go through to get there” Bowa said. “Montreal was a really good team and they were tough to beat up there.”

It took five more gut-wrenching games against the Houston Astros including four that went extra innings for the Phillies to end their 30-year drought without a National League pennant. Seven innings into the deciding game they were staring at a 5-2 deficit with Nolan Ryan on the mound. Ryan was 112-3 when leading after seven innings at that point in his career. The Phillies won 8-7 in 10 innings thanks to an RBI double by Maddox.

It wasn’t just the superstar core that carried the Phillies that year. Rookies Lonnie Smith and Keith Moreland perfectly complemented a bench that included veterans Del Unser and Greg Gross. Rookies Marty Bystrom and Bob Walk were asked to pitch huge games in the postseason after making major contributions during the regular season. Dick Ruthven won 17 games in the regular season and Game 5 of the Houston series by pitching two perfect innings.

It was the greatest season in Phillies history and it should always be treasured and periodically celebrated especially while the participants are still alive.",,,

A year ago around this time as the pandemic spiked in the U.S. we were facing uncharted territory. Like many companies we had to prioritize. We chose to focus on our role as a health & wellness company lead with our values and put people at the center.

Out of all this our company purpose became even clearer: We champion people to be well and thrive every single day. Our purpose informs our strategy our actions our behaviors and the commitments we make to all of our stakeholders.

Anchored by our purpose we were inspired to revisit our company values. Our previous values had served us well but they didn’t reflect how we’ve evolved as a company. Or how times have changed.

So we took a closer look at our values and refreshed them to better reflect who we are today and who we aspire to be tomorrow. At the same time we’ve kept a connection with who we’ve always been.

Our new values reflect our past and our future

If you want to get a sense of a company’s culture look at its values. For us our values underlie how we operate and how we show up every day for each other and for those we serve.

Do the right thing is in our DNA and will always be core to who we are. Whatever a person’s experience or background they must have integrity to succeed at Clorox. Nothing less will do. People trust us with their well-being and that’s something we will never forget and always take to heart.

We’ve also always been a people-centered company and the past year has provided us the privilege of showing our consumers communities and employees what this really means. In this way Put People at the Center also feels very familiar. But there are ways we aspire to be better. We’re committed to playing a stronger role in supporting equality and we will become even more focused on understanding and serving the millions of people who bring our products into their homes and workplaces.

Play to Win mirrors our aspirations and our resolve. Change is a constant and consumer expectations continue to rise. So we will embrace new ways of thinking move faster and build our resilience remembering that we are playing to win (in the right way) for our employees our consumers our shareholders and our planet.

I’m excited about these new values. They reinforce our purpose and they will help us navigate whatever opportunities and challenges come next. If they speak to you come talk to us. We’re always looking to work with great people who want to make the world a better place.

The owner of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) this month said it will never reopen physical trading pits it shut last March due to the COVID-19 pandemic though a Eurodollar options pit will remain open.

Traders and brokers who work away from CBOT's grain pits found it easier to execute complicated options transactions with help from the floor. The pits also provided a reliable source for options quotes that are not always available in markets that are solely electronic traders said.

Such information would be particularly valuable now as corn and soybean futures are climbing to eight-year highs and markets are gyrating on concerns about dwindling global supplies.

""This is the type of market where you need a human being sometimes to make a market for you"" said Brian Splitt a partner at agricultural research and advisory firm AgMarket.net.

Open-outcry trading was a raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. CME closed most futures pits in 2015 due to the rise of computerized trading although more than 20 products such as Eurodollar and grain options were still traded in pits.

Bids and offers on certain grain options disappeared on the screen when futures prices recently climbed by daily trading limits making it difficult to get a sense of the market Splitt said.

""The pit was always dependable"" he said. ""When things were really wild and you had limit-up moves you could call down to the pit and know what the options were trading synthetically.""

Once futures surge by the daily limit exchange rules prohibit them from trading higher until the next session. Options traders still calculate ""synthetic"" values based on options demand they see.

A few blocks from the CBOT in downtown Chicago Cboe Global Markets reopened its options trading floor last summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTUvbm9iZWwtd2lubmVyLWRhbmllbC1rYWhuZW1hbnMtbmV3LWJvb2staXMtYWxsLWFib3V0LXlvdXItbW9uZXktLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wNS8xNS9ub2JlbC13aW5uZXItZGFuaWVsLWthaG5lbWFucy1uZXctYm9vay1pcy1hbGwtYWJvdXQteW91ci1tb25leS0uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman's new book on bad decisions has a lot to say about market overconfidence and money mistakes,"Klontz: Yes. I love the concept of delaying intuition of not immediately acting on your instincts. Open-mindedness is associated with success in almost all endeavors. Don't trust your instincts. In my last book ""Money Mammoth"" I talked a lot about the ""tribal brain"" what is the optimal way to deal with life in a group of about 150 people which is how our ancestors lived. It helps explain why we should mistrust our instincts when it comes to money because the exact same instincts that helped us survive and thrive in small groups with constant threat often backfire in our modern financial lives. In essence when it comes to money we are wired to do it all wrong.

CNBC: Kahneman recommends several ways to combat bad decision making and noise. He talks about ""decision hygiene"" or ways of making more consistent judgments. Does that make sense?

This problem is well-known in the field of psychology. For example random error exists in all attempts to measure things such as personality traits or the effectiveness of medications or therapies. We use the scientific method and statistical analysis to try to mitigate random error but it is always a threat to our trying to make sense of objective truth.

Klontz: Partly it's a problem that people don't recognize the random nature of their decision making. But there's other reasons. While it can backfire ironically variability in judgment has been one of the keys to our survival as a species. Many decisions are not black and white. In primitive times and today people could die from a bad judgment so there is a bit of natural selection in there.

CNBC: Kahneman says there are problems with ""bias"" where people are consistently weighted toward one viewpoint like a bathroom scale that is always two pounds over. But his emphasis is on ""noise"" which he calls ""random variability in judgments"" where the decision-making is random and inconsistent. Why does that happen?

Klontz: Yes. Being an expert in a particular field can make biases more difficult to identify more resistant to change and lead to greater harm.

CNBC: The central thesis of the book is that people — particularly professionals like doctors judges and financial advisors — often make very bad judgments. Radiologists don't provide consistent interpretations of X-rays. Judges don't provide consistent judgments. Financial advisors are overconfident in their advice. Do you concur?

I sat down with Dr. Brad Klontz a member of the CNBC Financial Wellness Council to get his reaction to Kahneman's central thesis which is that biases and noise (random variability in our judgments) are ever-present in our lives but there are ways we can improve our judgment skills. Dr. Klontz is a CFP and psychologist and author of several books including most recently ""Money Mammoth"" (Wiley 2020).

""Noise"" was co-written with Olivier Sibony a French expert in decision making and Cass R. Sunstein a legal scholar and behavioral economics expert. Kahneman is one of the founding fathers of behavioral science and author of the seminal work ""Thinking Fast and Slow.""

Nobel Prize-winning psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman has a new book out asking a question that is central to making the right calls on the markets and money: Why does everyone make such bad decisions and what can we do about it?

When everyone is getting into cryptocurrency we are hard-wired to believe that we should join them. On a deep psychological level it feels like a threat to our survival to not jump in.

For example herd instinct is good when you are in a primitive society. If everyone is running from a lion you should too. If you decide to not go along with the herd and are standing still you are going to get eaten. Everyone who believed you should stand still while everyone else is running has gotten picked off and they didn't pass down their genes to us.

While it helped us survive throughout all of prehistory the herd instinct is bad when you are making modern financial decisions. When everyone is getting into cryptocurrency we are hard-wired to believe that we should join them. On a deep psychological level it feels like a threat to our survival to not jump in. So we have to keep second guessing and combatting our natural instincts. Always second guess yourself avoid overconfidence and stay open-minded.

CNBC: So we should have less confidence in our instincts?

Klontz: We would transform our world if we had less confidence in our conclusions. We are constantly segregating ourselves and surrounding ourselves with people who think like we do. Sometimes our beliefs are so strong we try to hurt people who believe differently. We need to be able to observe ourselves more objectively.

Less confidence would reduce conflict because we're not as entrenched in our subjective conclusions.

Putting some time between our impulses and actions helps calm down our emotional brain and helps us activate our prefrontal cortex — the part of our brain that helps us think through the consequences of our actions. It can also give us time to seek out the opinions of others too.

CNBC: Kahneman also recommends that organizations do ""noise audits"" where they check to see how consistent the judgment-making is among their group whether it is radiologists judges or stock pickers. Your reaction?

Klontz: It's a great idea and the only surprising thing is it's not done on a regular basis. This is well-known in psychology. It's called inter-rater reliability which acknowledges that it can be difficult for even experts to agree on their analysis and conclusions. For example in diagnosing an autism spectrum disorder the gold standard focuses on training to ensure inter-rating reliability to make sure everyone is coming to the same conclusion. And I absolutely agree it should be done elsewhere. We should put much more work into taking established methodology in psychology and generalizing it across professions especially those that are involve life and death decisions like medicine or law.

CNBC: Kahneman recommends more rigorous use of rules-based decision making to get away from random human judgments. Do you agree?

Klontz: Yes particularly when there is a clear indication of a correct or incorrect decision such as this person has a tumor or they don't. When there are clear life or death decisions we need to limit variability in judgment. I mentioned the autism diagnosis. That is where you need a structured reliable rules-based approach.

But we can't become too rigid or rule-bound and need to keep an open mind. We have to recognize that there will be changes in the rules as our knowledge base increases and be open to changing those rules when the facts change.

Also remember many decisions and conclusions in life are entirely subjective. The idea is not so much to stamp out variability in human judgment but to come to terms with its existence and with the idea we are vulnerable to misjudgments. Awareness and humility is the key. Recognizing that we can make a different judgment depending on what time of day it is or what we had for lunch is a key step toward making better judgments.

CNBC: One of my favorite chapters was where Kahneman noted that people particularly professionals have very high opinions of their own opinions.

Klontz: Yes there's an evolutionary benefit to that. Say you're convinced a famine is coming and the other guy is convinced there is no famine coming. If you get a famine you are fine because you planned for it but the other guy is gone. So believing in your own opinion and convincing other people to go along with you has helped us survive as a species.

But in the modern world it can lead to overconfidence. For example women tend to outperform men as investors. They are not as vulnerable to overconfidence. Men believe they can outperform and end up by trading more. The evidence is they can't. Again a healthy dose of self-doubt can be very good for us.

CNBC: Kahneman also devotes some time to discussing why everyone is so bad at predicting the future.

Klontz: We all know you can't predict the future for exactly the reasons Kahneman said: We are saddled with biases and noise and there is an unknowability about the future because things happen that are not predictable.

But this doesn't prevent us from trying and it's important to understand why. Again this desire to predict the future is an evolutionary advantage. It's necessary to try to predict the future because it has helped us survive as a species. It's essential to our survival. The ones who are future-oriented and worry about the future are the ones who may have survived in the past.

But that doesn't help us as much in the modern age. We have not evolved much from ""Lighting means the gods are angry."" Most of our decisions are made by our emotional brain and we have a relatively small prefrontal cortex that does the rational thinking on top of a large emotional brain — and when we get excited or scared our emotional brain kicks in and we are vulnerable to acting like our prehistoric ancestors.

So we can't eliminate attempts to predict the future because we are thinking about it all the time. However it is essential that we don't put too much weight into our predictions and to recognize that they are merely our attempts to make sense of a chaotic world. It is important for us to recognize the limitations of our knowledge and become a little more comfortable with uncertainty.",,,,,,,,,

Colgate has apologised to the father of an autistic girl after he complained about a TV advertisement that referred to autistic people as “troubled”.

The toothpaste company featured a teacher who works with autistic children. However underneath the teacher’s name in the advert the caption reads: “art teacher for troubled children”.

Duncan Casburn whose 10-year-old daughter Sienna May is autistic raised concerns about the advertisement in a video that he shared on YouTube.

“Just because someone has special education needs it doesn’t make them ‘troubled’” Mr Casburn said in the video.

“The issue was around the word ‘troubled’ and its wider connotations” he continued. “It is the wrong way to label special educational needs and disabled children.

“We are trying to dispel this impression. Just because you are different to the majority of society does not make you troubled. Autism is just a different way to viewing the world and processing it.”

Within a week Colgate had removed the TV advertisement and issued an apology.

Mr Casburn was also invited to conduct an interview with Patricia Verduin head of research and development for Colgate which has been sent to all its offices across the globe.

He said: “I just copied them into my video where I highlighted why the word ‘troubled’ was wrong and shouldn’t have been used.

“They responded straight away and said they were looking into this. Within 48 hours the video was taken off the website and TV and has since been amended.”

Speaking about the interview Mr Casburn added: “We set up an interview to discuss the ad and how they could address their side of it. It turned a negative into a really positive thing.

“They are now sending the interview around internally and say ‘this was a mistake we made that we don’t want to do again in future.’”

He went on to say how touched he was by Colgate’s handling of the situation.

“I was stunned to be honest. This is how you can handle a situation and turn a negative into something positive.”

Colgate was contacted for a comment.

A freighter loaded with bales of used plastic casts off somewhere in the industrialized world gaining steam as it sails toward a developing country. After the ship arrives in port and the cargo is unloaded it’s anyone’s guess how much—if any—of this plastic will be recycled. Some or all could get stacked in landfills burned in the open or blown away as litter that eventually ends up in the ocean the final resting place in our environment for plastic debris.

Images of sea turtles choking on translucent bags and dead seabirds with bellies full of colorful plastic debris have snagged the attention of the public and policy makers worldwide. The same is true for mountains of plastic waste building up in developing countries that lack infrastructure to recycle or dispose of it. At United Nations meetings for the last several years governments have discussed how they might address plastic waste.

After all those years of discussion the world may finally be getting serious about keeping plastic including microplastics out of the environment and finding a way to reuse products flakes of used polymers or the molecules that make up plastics. Many governments environmental activists and companies including the global chemical industry generally concur that a treaty to control plastics is the way to go. They see an accord as a route to improve the collection of used plastics and increase infrastructure for recycling the materials.

“A UN treaty on plastic pollution can help drive the transition to a circular economy for plastic” says a declaration from Coca-Cola and other multinational corporations that are key drivers in the global demand for plastics.

In a circular economy used plastics become the raw materials for new plastics. Other companies that signed the declaration include Colgate-Palmolive Henkel PepsiCo Procter & Gamble and Unilever as well as retailer H&M and food-service company Sodexo. They want international focus on the entire product life cycle of plastics not just a focus on marine litter says Tim Grabiel senior lawyer for the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency an advocacy group.

That so many users of vast quantities of plastic are calling for a plastics treaty “signals winds of change” in global policies and for markets says Jane Patton a senior campaigner for the nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law.

A UN treaty on plastic pollution can help drive the transition to a circular economy for plastic. Colgate-Palmolive Henkel Procter & Gamble and other multinational companies in a declaration

The International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) which represents many makers of plastics also backs creation of a treaty. Echoing the corporations’ declaration Stewart Harris who often speaks on behalf of the ICCA at UN meetings says a new pact must “really stimulate a move towards a circular economy.”

Of course the devil is in the details. Achieving circularity will require distinct strategies for different countries or regions of the world says Harris who is senior director of marine and environmental stewardship in the Plastics Division of the American Chemistry Council a US industry group. He points to India’s thriving business in converting used polyethylene terephthalate—the plastic commonly used for water and other beverage bottles—into fabric. Because of this existing infrastructure India may opt for a different strategy for handling plastics than say Latin America Harris says.

Patton however is skeptical of creating a treaty that encourages countries to take a patchwork of approaches. “Plastic supply chains are global” she says. Thus a harmonized worldwide effort is needed to address plastic she says.

Regardless the overall goal for a treaty is to ensure that all used plastic is collected managed properly and recycled Patton and Harris agree. “Keep it in the economy and out of the environment” Harris says. Patton and Grabiel stress that to achieve this end the world needs adequate plastics recycling infrastructure which it currently lacks.

One big hurdle is that a glut of cheap virgin plastic derived from abundant and inexpensive fracked natural gas is currently undermining efforts to recycle plastic Grabiel says.

“It’s generally accepted that recycled plastic costs more” than plastic produced directly from fossil fuels Harris says.

Nevertheless some companies responding to consumer demand still seek to use recycled material. That reveals a second barrier: demand for recycled plastic outstrips supply. “If you are a company that is looking to put more recycled content in your packaging it’s very difficult to find” Harris says. He adds “I don’t think price is the barrier” to more widespread recycling of plastic today.

The ICCA promotes recycling plastics by mechanical means—chipping used material into flakes and melting them to form new products—and through chemical processes Harris says. Some chemical recycling operations break down polymers into monomers for reuse as building blocks to create new plastics. Other chemical recycling approaches produce additives or fuels.

Environmentalists look askance at the chemical industry’s enthusiasm for chemical recycling of plastic and are skeptical about a treaty endorsing this process. They point out that chemical recycling is energy intensive. Also recycling plastics into fuels takes materials out of a circular plastics economy and leads to the release of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and other pollutants such as particulate matter when the fuels burn.

Keep it in the economy and out of the environment. Stewart Harris senior director of marine and environmental stewardship in the Plastics Division American Chemistry Council

Harris says that chemical recycling efforts initially produced fuels because demand to recycle back into plastic was low. That’s not the case today he says.

Meanwhile Grabiel and some other environmental advocates want governments to model a plastics treaty on the highly successful strategy used to phase out chemicals that erode Earth’s protective stratospheric ozone layer. Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer countries agreed to first cap and then phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-destroying chemicals. This created demand for alternative chemicals that were either less harmful or ozone safe—but more expensive Grabiel says.

Similar to how the world phased out CFCs “we need to give up virgin plastic production and consumption” Grabiel says. A global policy to reduce the supply of new resins and pellets will increase the demand for recycled plastics and promote investment in infrastructure for collection and recycling he says.

Not surprisingly the ICCA sees such a strategy and a global freeze on virgin plastic manufacturing as problematic. “How would you implement it in such a way that it didn’t cause massive disruptions to the market?” Harris asks. He reiterates that countries need to come up with their own strategies for addressing plastics.

Concerns about plastics’ contribution to global warming are also cropping up. More than 50 countries and the European Union joined by a number of environmental advocacy groups are part of a global coalition that emphasizes that the manufacture of virgin plastic contributes to climate change.

Although plastics can help address climate change such as by replacing heavier materials to improve fuel efficiency in transportation “the production of plastic is typically energy-intensive and relies on fossil fuel feedstock” says the coalition called the Group of Friends which is led by Antigua and Barbuda the Maldives and Norway.

Plus extraction of natural gas and oil for plastics feedstocks releases methane Patton points out. Methane a greenhouse gas has 28–36 times as much potential to cause global warming as carbon dioxide over 100 years. On the other end of the plastics life cycle items buried in landfills also release methane as they break down.

“It doesn’t matter where in the supply chain you look—they have a very large climate footprint” Patton says of plastics.

Patton also thinks a new treaty should call for plastics of the future to be nontoxic—made without additives hazardous to health. The pact should also have an environmental justice goal to ensure that no countries are disproportionately burdened with other nations’ plastic waste she says.

These and other issues will surely come up at treaty talks which could start as early as next year. In February 2022 the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) the world’s top body on environmental policies and law is expected to launch negotiations.

Where the US stands on a possible treaty isn’t yet clear. A Department of State spokesperson tells C&EN “The United States strongly supports taking action to address plastic pollution including ocean plastic pollution. We look forward to working with UNEA partners to consider how we should move forward.”

If it opts for negotiating a plastics pact the UNEA could recommend that the new accord be an extension of an existing environmental treaty Inger Andersen executive director of the UN Environment Programme told reporters in February. Governments haven’t settled on which agreement that might be Andersen said.

A strong contender is a pact controlling international trade of hazardous waste—the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. The Basel Convention requires that before someone ships most plastic scrap and waste to another country that country must be notified and consent to receiving the materials. Though most countries—187—are partners to this treaty the US is not among them.

Regardless of the form it takes Harris says a plastics pact will help the world answer a key challenge: “How do we take this great product and keep it in our economy?”",,,,,,,,,
CMCSA,Comcast,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY29yYWxzcHJpbmdzdGFsay5jb20vY29tbW9uLW15dGgtYWJvdXQtY2FibGUtYW5kLWludGVybmV0LTMyNjky0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City of Coral Springs Debunks Common Myth About Cable and Internet Providers • Coral Springs Talk,"Share Tweet reddit Whatsapp

By: Bryan Boggiano

A diverse array of internet and cable service providers can be found in Coral Springs but a common myth is the city allows only two Bluestream and AT&T.

Resident Sam Poulos is getting two different stories. Comcast the parent company of Xfinity told him the city’s restrictions do not let other internet and cable providers in. The city told him it’s because Comcast will not run the lines.

“I don’t want a song and dance from our leaders” he wrote on Facebook “I want to know the truth.”

Poulos isn’t the only resident with this concern. In November Sandra Hernandez wrote “I wish Comcast was allowed to service Coral Springs.”

There is also a Facebook group to end what some residents say is a monopoly on service providers. With 145 members Blue Stream Sucks the old Advanced Cable Communications of Coral Springs seeks to “elect a politician that will allow companies like Comcast to come and supply reliable service.”

Coral Springs spokesperson Lynne Martzall said Bluestream and AT&T have infrastructure built in the city; however Comcast only has their infrastructure in the Corporate Park.

“We cannot surmise why residents hold a specific belief but when a service provider indicates they are unable to service the area a resident may be under the impression it is the fault of the city” she said. “That is untrue.”

While the Xfinity services businesses and some homes in the city there are homes located too far from the existing network said Cynthia Arco with Comcast Florida Region.

“Our approach is to continue to review any potential service areas and look for ways to expand our network and bring Xfinity services to more people” she said.

Data from broadbandnow.com shows residential properties in Coral Springs have at least three provider options available. Some neighborhoods have five options including Brookside Mariner’s Cove The Isles The Springs and Cypress Run north of Lakeview Drive.

AT&T Internet HughesNet Viasat and Bluestream are available to over 90 percent of residents. Xfinity has about 25 percent availability while AT&T Fiber is about 30 percent and Hotwire Communications just over one percent.

Martzall said the city has no franchise agreement with any cable provider. For any internet or cable company to operate in the city they would need to apply for a permit through the building department. Upon approval they would refer them to the engineering department. This would give residents more options for providers.

“The city recognizes the importance of expansive and reliable cable and internet access for residents and businesses” she said. “We welcome service providers to submit permits and plans to develop their infrastructure in the city.”

In the mid-1960s City Hall topped by the William Penn Statue ranking as the tallest building with most other tall towers clustering in the vicinity. Over the next few decades the Center City skyline has extended greatly to the east and west with many dominant modern office towers surpassing City Hall. Today Philly YIMBY looks back and compares the skyline from 1965 skyline to its current form.

In 1965 no buildings rose above the William Penn statue out of respect for the so-called “gentlemen’s agreement.” In the second half of the decade and at the start of the 1970s several large towers were built such as 1700 Market Street PECO Building and One Meridian Plaza becoming some of the tallest buildings in the city with many more on the way in the next 50 years.

By 2020 there were eight towers taller than 500 feet not including structures under construction. One Commerce Square was the first tower to breach the height of City Hall in June 1986 followed by the 945-foot-tall One Liberty Place in the next three months. In 2007 Comcast Center became the city’s tallest building at 974 feet then the Comcast Technology Center topped the skyline in 2017 at 1121 feet tall. By 2020 construction was in progress on the lower floors of the 599-foot-tall Laurel Rittenhouse Square while the 542-foot-tall Arthaus was further along as the tower had reached the halfway point by October.

Round 11

You can be forgiven if your attention to hockey waned in early March. The Predators at the time were more than 10 points out of the playoff race plagued by injuries and simply not playing with the kind of intensity that the team had become known for. The trade deadline was looming and nearly every analyst was talking about how many draft picks and prospects Mattias Ekholm would be worth as he sat high atop everyone’s coveted trade bait list. “Maybe next year” and “rebuild” were more top of mind than any kind of playoff run. And yet here we are with the Preds clinching their spot in the post season on the second-to-last game of the season edging out Dallas to face the number 1 seed in Central Division. They got there by other-worldly goaltending from Jusse Saros the HERD line and a bit of swagger that had been missing in the shortened 56-game schedule. We have no idea if their success can continue but it has been a remarkable turnaround from two short months ago.

The Opponents

If you stopped reading here and knew nothing else of the season you’d leave with the confidence that the hockey gods will bless the Predators with a deep postseason run and that the Carolina Hurricanes are just one step along that journey. Oh to be that naive. Prior to the final two games of the season the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Preds six straight times with only one game that was competitive (an overtime loss for Nashville). The leading scorer for the Canes is 23 year-old Sebastian Aho who prior to that final two-game series was averaging about a goal a game against the Preds. They also boast one of the few defense corps that can go toe to toe with Roman Josi and Ryan Ellis. There are very few categories in this matchup where you can give an edge to Nashville. Most neutral analysts believe this will be a five or six game series with Carolina inevitably moving on. But given how the season has gone so far for the Predators anything is possible.

[1] In a normal year this would have a fancier name like “Western Conference Quarterfinals”. We still aren’t in a normal year yet.

How to Watch

The Predators will increase their seating capacity for the playoffs to 12135 per game which is roughly 70 percent of its normal capacity. It will be hard to tell that other 30 percent isn’t there once the crowd gets going for a playoff series. As of Friday tickets were still available on the team site for astronomical prices but secondary markets had them for around $100 each. A word of caution before buying online or on the street corner though: scammers regularly dupe folks into paying for bogus tickets especially around playoff time. You should make sure that you are either buying from someone you already trust or directly from the team.

Then again you might want to nervously pace around your own home for the games or perhaps you need to give an assist to a bartender that cannot find the correct channel for a game. Either way these are the channels.

Where to Watch

In a bit of a return to normalcy the Predators will have their traditional “Smash Car” on the plaza for home games where you take a swing at it for charity. That is in addition to what is expected to be a festival-like atmosphere outside the arena though it may be a bit smaller than year’s past with COVID-19 concerns still high. We don’t know yet whether they will have the big screens outside for everyone who couldn’t get a ticket.

The Predators have also compiled a list of “Preds Approved” venues for the playoffs. These are bars and restaurants that promise to have the game on and to play the audio over the speakers.

“We talk about scouting we think of evaluating two shortstops and all the tools but part of scouting too is understanding when player A tells you he’s hurt vs. Player B tells you how should we be interpreting that?” general manager Thad Levine said. “And I would say Jake is in one of those categories of when he expresses discomfort it gets your attention and it makes you realize that there may be something significant going on.”

Tests revealed a stress reaction in Cave’s lower back an injury that will keep him out for at least two months. The Twins put the outfielder on the 60-day injured list on Saturday selecting the contract of Rob Refsnyder who had two hits in the Twins’ 5-4 win over the Athletics in his place.

Manager Rocco Baldelli said Cave had been playing through back soreness during the season but he raggravated it Wednesday in Chicago as he was running the bases. He then went back out in the outfield and had to make a play out there after the injury.

“Come to find out he’s out there making plays and he had a broken vertebrae that he was running around with” Baldelli said. “That’s not something obviously anyone had any idea about. Just something he was kind of playing through. Kind of gives you a little taste for what some of these guys do play through on not a regular basis but these are things that can happen.”

While Cave hadn’t been hitting particularly well this season his absence causes an issue for a Twins team that is already without starting center fielder Byron Buxton. While both are out Max Kepler will see most of the playing time in center field.

Beyond that the depth at that position is thin. Baldelli said Refsnyder is not a center fielder but could go out and play there. Kyle Garlick could also be called upon there if need be though he is currently playing through “a little bit of a groin” issue Baldelli said.

Refsnyder has just 14 games of minor league experience in center but he said he’s been taking reps there recently and feels good. While the Twins have Keon Broxton an experienced center fielder also at Triple-A Baldelli cited Refsnyder’s offensive profile as the reason they decided to go with him.

Refsnyder who has played parts of five seasons in the majors received the news of the call-up from Triple-A manager Toby Gardenhire while holding his two-month-old baby boy Drake.

“I don’t take these opportunities for granted” he said. “I’m going to play as hard as I possibly can and lay it all out there. Being that up-and-down guy throughout my career you kind of savor these moments a bit longer than you’d like to admit.”

Briefly

Devin Smeltzer who went on the injured list earlier this week has some nerve irritation in his left elbow Baldelli said though “his ligament and everything related to that seems OK.” For now the Twins will back off for a period of time to let the nerve heal before building him back up.“He’s going to be down for a period of time probably another discussion of a matter of weeks I would say” Baldelli said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent closures of the Sebastiani Vineyards and Clos du Bois wineries and relocation of the brands to other production facilities came as a shock for those who have associated the names with their locations over decades — or a century in Sebastiani’s case.

But experts who have handled many deals North Coast wine properties say those business decisions as painful as they are for the workers involved are a common reality for when bottle prices are out of whack with the costs of doing business in the region.

A common life cycle of wine brands is with more consumer popularity comes the benefits and headaches of expanding production of the brand according to Mario Zepponi whose Santa Rosa-based beverage alcohol mergers-and-acquisitions firm has handled various sides of significant deals in recent years.

“With more volume comes more costs” Zepponi said.

The Clos du Bois brand started as a Sonoma County-centric label. But as it was positioned under a succession of owners to be a mass-market wine the pressures of the retail marketplace call for balancing the pricing structure and costs of production. When Sonoma County grape prices go up rapidly taking up the winery price accordingly ripples through distribution to the shelf price and can result in lower sales volume.

So a common tactic for North Coast wines with increasing costs for grapes or bulk wine is to expand the sourcing say to a bigger appellation such as “California.” But then the brand can become less associated with the higher-cost appellation where it started Zepponi said.

The situation is quite different for “cult” high-end North Coast brands such as Napa Valley’s Screaming Eagle or Russian River Valley’s Merry Edwards where higher bottle prices can act as a governor for sales when production is only a few thousand cases annually. And for such exclusive businesses it’s all about the vineyards and the production process at the winery as was the case for Roederer’s acquisition of Merry Edwards.

“Assets couldn’t be dissociated with the business” said Robert Nicholson of Healdsburg’s International Wine Associates of the Merry Edwards deal.

And the minority investment from the Faiveley family of France's Burgundy region investment early this year in Williams Selyem Winery was based largely on the vintner’s connection to Sonoma County pinot noir grapes Nicholson said.

At the other end of the spectrum is Michael David Winery’s sale of the 7 Deadly Zins zinfandel brand in 2018 a deal Nicholson’s firm helped broker. The Wine Group bought the Lodi-based brand which at the time didn’t have its own winery for the 300000 cases produced annually.

But Michael David Winery had purchased a surplus Sonoma County winery the preceding year picking up a surplus Alexander Valley facility from Silver Oak Cellars which had just built a new winery nearby. A goal for the Lodi vintner in that North Coast purchase was to have home for local fruit and a local brand the Business Journal reported at the time.

And there have been other relocations of North Coast brands out of wineries to move in higher-value brands. A key example was Constellation Brands’ move of the Franciscan brand out of a Napa Valley winery after the 2016 purchase of The Prisoner high-end cabernet sauvignon portfolio for $285 million part of the New York-based company’s “premiumization” move away from lower-end brands.

“These assets get repurposed” Zepponi said. It could be by the owner of the facility bringing in a brand that needs more connection to the appellation or to a new owner with a similar intention.

For example Treasury Wine Estates sold its underutilized large northern Sonoma County winery in Asti to E. & J. Gallo Winery and Gallo also bought The Ranch custom winery in Napa Valley. Gallo then shifted around North Coast brands to those facilities.

Cultural differences in brand–asset linkage

The track record of West Coast and California North Coast wine business acquisitions has been that buyers of brands with just intellectual property inventory and contracts for grapes and bulk wine typically are from the U.S. and buyers of “integrated wineries” that also have their own production facilities and vineyards usually have been from outside the country according to Zepponi.

“That does not mean the domestic buyers do not care” Zepponi said. “International buyers typically are from the Old World where it starts with a vineyard and then goes to a production facility and then a brand is produced. If you don’t have vineyard assets you do not have control over quality and there is a cultural disconnect.”

Value of irreplicable permits

Some North Coast wineries are more valuable for their capacity events and other permits than for the brands produced there. Napa County adopted its Winery Definition Ordinance in 1990 limiting production and visitation of facilities approved thereafter and Sonoma County later this year is considering regulations for winery events in three popular areas (Russian River Dry Creek and Sonoma valleys).

“It’s not like 50 years when everybody could build a facility and build it as big as you want” Zepponi said. “Now you have the land-use challenge of getting a permit so wineries have independent value because you just cannot put another big wine production facility in their current locations.”

Another example of irreplaceable credentials are production facilities in Napa Valley that have “grandfathered” permits that allow them to truck in more of their fruit from outside the county Zepponi said.

To get a better understanding of the initiative Portada talked to Oscar Martinez Senior Brand Director Tecate USA.

The official Tecate sponsorship and its associated activations reflect the long-standing affinity and passion for Mexican soccer here in the U.S. The agreement includes the use of logos names and images of teams and players participating in LIGA BBVA MX interviews with Mexican soccer legends presence in matches during the season openings and closings access to exclusive items and a presence in the best match highlights on LIGA BBVA MX social platforms.

“With this exclusive sponsorship Tecate takes a strong step forward to stand as the brand that best connects U.S. fans with their favorite LIGA MX soccer teams offering memorable experiences on and off the field” Tecate Sr. Brand Director Oscar Martinez tells Portada. “With an exciting summer of soccer upon us we’re thrilled to deliver unforgettable experiences that speak to our maverick and unapologetic spirit. Mexico is in us!”

Guillermo Alegret Commercial Director of LIGA MX added “We are very excited to have Tecate an established well known Mexican brand expand their partnership of LIGA MX into the United States. There is no doubt that LIGA MX’s following in the U.S. is very strong with an average of over 400000 viewers per match representing 40% of LIGA MX’s audience. The American market continues to be an important place for LIGA MX to grow and connect on a daily basis with the Hispanic community in addition to the over 35 million Mexican Americans residing there.”

“Tecate is already one of Mexican-Americans’ favorite brands to enjoy with friends and that is the intention of this partnership: to offer fun and safe experiences for fans of legal age while allowing us to deliver messages of social responsibility” Martinez added.

Tecate Sponsorships: Switch from Boxing to Soccer

A few years ago Tecate switched from boxing to soccer in terms of the sports it will be supporting to reach U.S. audiences. Martinez notes that “boxing gave a lot to Tecate and for that we’ll be always grateful to our partners in the sport. With soccer however we have the opportunity to expand our consumer base and engage in ongoing conversation with them 365 days a year with a more fluid schedule of events and retail activation opportunities.”

According to Martinez “the pivot to soccer is a biproduct of the natural evolution of our consumer base and we jumped at the opportunity to become official sponsors of LIGA MX in the U.S. The ultimate goal of course being to recruit more avid Tecate consumers while helping to elevate the overall profile of the sport in America. Martinez adds that as a brand “we’re constantly on the lookout for how our consumers are engaging with and reacting to the content we put out there. We do a yearly internal marketing mix analysis the preliminary data from which shows very positive responses to our soccer programming. As a brand that has taken on a new positioning in the last couple of years it’s important to us to be mindful of what moves our U.S. market and soccer is definitely trending in that direction.”

Nick Kelly until the end of 2020 Head of U.S. Sports Marketing at Anheuser-Busch and currently president of Charlotte F.C. told Portada in an 2019 interview that “LigaMX can be a much better experiential marketing vehicle to engage U.S. Hispanics than the MLS.” Tecate’s Martinez agrees: “Liga MX is the most watched and followed soccer league in the U.S. and our brand attributes and consumer base align near perfectly with Liga MX expansion goals in the US. We’re in a great position to engage with the fans of the fastest growing sport in the U.S.”

According to Martinez Tecate has built “a very strong relationship in the U.S. with three of the most relevant soccer teams from Mexico: Chivas Tigres and Rayados which have allowed us to engage with their fans in markets like California Texas and Illinois – each of which is a core DMA for the Tecate U.S. brand.”

Regarding upcoming activations of the new Tecate sponsorship Martinez says that he is currently “developing an activation plan that will leverage and help proliferate key points of the sponsorship. Our team is excited to fully execute on that plan as soon as it’s safe to reopen including soccer legends’ participation at retail activations fan viewing parties incentive trips to games in Mexico for our consumers and retailers and text-to-win opportunities among others.”

Additionally within the HEINEKEN USA portfolio the Heineken® brand has already been a passionate supporter of MLS for many years as sponsor of Inter Miami Club de Fútbol Orlando City SC NY Red Bulls and NYCFC among others. Last year the brand executed a “Stadium in a Box” sweepstakes which effectively brought the passion and excitement of an MLS match to winning fans’ homes.

Synergies on Both Sides of the Border

Tecate is the official sponsor of Liga BBVA MX in Mexico as well thus the synergies on both sides of the border bring added power and opportunity to the overall Tecate sponsorship. “This particular partnership will facilitate us becoming even more engaged with and meaningful to an already loyal bicultural consumer in the USA” Martinez adds.

In addition Tecate will be the main sponsor of the Campeón de Campeones match set to take place in Los Angeles this July. This game is the only official Liga MX game held outside of Mexico and Tecate will be fully activating at retail and on-site to bring even more energy and excitement around the most watched soccer league in the U.S.

As befits his status as a former 007 Brosnan’s personal style is matinée idol-smooth and closer in spirit to Roger Moore’s suave playboy ethos than Daniel Craig’s lean and mean approach. This means Brosnan's on-screen watches are a lot more fun too.

Brosnan's first big break came in the 1980s when he played the dashing upper-class detective Remington Steele. In the series Steele can often be seen wearing a gold watch with a black dial from Rolex’s Cellini line the brand’s dress watch collection which sometimes goes under-appreciated due to all the attention on its sports watch icons. The thin elegant Cellini with gold hands complements the suave and sophisticated Steele image quite wonderfully. Unfortunately it remains unclear which reference he’s wearing but not to worry; the images show just how chic a pure dress watch can be when paired with a suit.

Steele’s other watch was also perfectly suited to the dressy glamour of the 1980s and is now particularly relevant to 2021: the Cartier Panthère on the brand’s Figaro bracelet. Cartier is enjoying a tremendous run this year with vintage models such as the Panthère going great guns in preowned and vintage markets and newly released updates of its Les Must line finding a fresh generation of fans. The Cartier theme continued into Brosnan’s next big role – as a Hong Kong business tycoon in the TV mini series Noble House. This saw him wearing a Pasha De Cartier another icon that was a huge hit in the 1980s.

Panthère de Cartier

Of course by the time he played James Bond in 1995’s GoldenEye Omega was making its debut as the supplier of 007’s watch. Throughout his turn as Bond Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional while also appearing in adverts for the brand’s Dynamic and Constellation models. But it wasn't Omega all the way. During his Bond phase Brosnan enjoyed a brief hiatus playing the titular playboy art thief in the 1999 remake of The Thomas Crown Affair. And of course a Jaeger LeCoultre Reverso Duo was the perfect watch to echo the two-facedness of the Thomas Crown world.",,,,,,

Intended to become the third of its kind the powerplant is a monster of a hardware and has already been chosen by one of Europe’s largest airplane manufacturers to be deployed on one of its products.

The company describes the 10X as the most powerful in the range as it offers 18000 lbs of thrust. It comprises something Rolls-Royce calls the Advance2 engine core which aside from giving the entire assembly more power it also provides a 5 percent increase in efficiency over what came before.The engine comprises the said core but also a blisked fan a high-pressure compressor a low emissions combustor with 3D-printed tiles and a two-stage shroudless high-pressure turbine. All these parts are wrapped inside a brand new slimline nacelle developed by an American company Spirit AeroSystems.At about the same time Rolls-Royce announced the details of the engine French company Dassault Aviation announced the Pearl 10X would power its next Falcon jet. In fact added the two companies the engine itself has been developed with the Dassault machine in mind as we’re told it has been “optimized to exclusively power Dassault’s brand-new flagship aircraft the Falcon 10X.”The French private jet is a top-of-the-line machine capable of covering the distance between say New York to Shanghai (over 7000 miles/11200 km) without the need to land. It will be capable of this thanks to the two Pearl engines of reaching speeds just shy of the speed of sound  Mach 0.925 while carrying people inside the “the biggest and most comfortable cabin on the market.”The new engine is still some time away from being ready to take to the sky. Work on it continues at Rolls’ facilities in Dahlewitz Germany.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Her game-winning homer in the bottom of the seventh wasn't so cut and dry.

With two outs Rijo stroked an opposite-field shot down the left-field line. As Horseheads left fielder Lexi Wahl-Knowlden put her arms up to indicate the ball was out of play Rijo raced around the bases for what ended up a winning home run in a 15-14 slugfest that featured four homers and 33 hits.

Corning the 2019 Class AA state champion earned a split of the weekend series after losing by a 12-3 score Friday on the road against Horseheads. The Hawks improved to 4-1 while the Blue Raiders fell to 2-2.

Rijo a first-team all-state pick in 2019 who has committed to the University of Virginia as a junior ended up 5-for-5 with the two homers two doubles six runs and seven RBIs.

Kellie Zoerb also homered for Corning as part of a 3-for-5 day that included four RBIs.

The teams combined to score in 12 of the 14 offensive innings.

More on the finish

Corning's field has an opening in foul territory next to the fence. Rijo's ball bounced into that corner near where a fan was sitting behind where the fence would extend in foul territory.

Horseheads head coach Rick Gryska argued the ball should have been ruled dead. Gryska in his first season as head coach ended up getting ejected after the game.

He pointed out to the umpires the risk of injury to his player in trying to retrieve a ball that ended up rolling near and behind the fan. Gryska said he was told because his player went after the ball the play was allowed to continue though he pointed out his outfielder only went after the ball because the umpires did not rule it dead.

""It's one of those calls where I don't get it but it happens and it's part of the game and we move on from there. That's it"" he said in a postgame interview.

Corning coach Mike Johnston credited Rijo with running out the play.

""That's fundamentals 101. You keep running until they put you back"" he said. ""It's up to them to make the call and we just kept running.

""The gray area is it's a judgment call. I didn't hear at the end what they said. I just told my kids 'Nice win.' ""

Strong offensive weekend for Horseheads

While Horseheads was frustrated with how the game ended there was a lot to like for the Blue Raiders over the two days. Molly Wolf homered in Friday's win and her two-run homer in the top of the seventh capped a four-run frame that tied the score after Rijo's grand slam in the previous inning.

Wolf ended up 3-for-3 with four runs and five RBIs. Olivia Packard was 3-for-4 with a double and five RBIs for the Blue Raiders. Eva Koratsis went 3-for-5 with three runs and two RBIs.

""Like I just told them a few minutes ago the resiliency and the drive and the competitiveness and not giving up if that's the way they're going to compete all year long it's going to be a very successful season for them"" Gryska said of his players.

""I think we've got to shore up our pitching a little bit. We'll talk to them about working ahead better in the counts. But we hit great today. (Friday) we popped a lot of balls up but today we hit a lot of line drives. We made some adjustments which is good so hopefully we can keep the bats rolling.""

Rijo a special talent

Rijo came to the plate in the bottom of the sixth with Horseheads' lead 10-9 and the bases loaded. Trying to avoid walking in the tying run Horseheads pitcher Erin Gill challenged Rijo with a fastball that she smashed over the fence in left field. Corning added another run for a 14-10 lead before the Raiders fought back to even the score.

Rijo came up with two outs and nobody on in the seventh with Zoerb on deck as Corning's No. 2 batter.

Adding to the challenge of facing Rijo is her speed makes it a strong possibility she'll end up stealing second base with a walk. By the time Horseheads players were putting their arms up on the winning hit Rijo was rounding second.

""She's held to a higher standard"" Johnston said. ""We have high expectations for her. She's been getting hits but not like we know she can. So I know she's been putting in extra time because that's what great players do. It's what they do when nobody's watching when we're not practicing when they're out on their own and she's doing that on a daily basis.

""She wasn't happy with getting just base hits and she's gone out and put the time in and obviously it paid off today.""

Five back from state champs

Rijo is one of five returning players from Corning's state championship season. Like all teams in New York the Hawks lost their 2020 season to the pandemic.

Even from Friday to Saturday Johnston said there was notable improvement.

""We are teachers first trying to teach our kids the game the best we know how"" he said. ""We're making mistakes but we're trying to get better every game. (Friday) we had nine walks we had eight errors five wild pitches and we missed four signs. Our goal today is if we had fewer walks fewer errors – we didn't miss a sign on the band today because we were more alert. We knew we could put runs up because our kids hit the ball and we thought we had a chance to win today so that was the difference.""

Sectional rematch?

There were no Section 4 tournaments for winter and fall team sports this year. However softball will join baseball and lacrosse in holding sectional tournaments this spring. That leaves open the possibility of a rematch between Horseheads and Corning in Class AA sectionals.

After falling 3-2 to Mohawk Valley Community College in the opening game of the best-of-three Region III A finals Friday the Red Barons bounced back with a 9-0 five-inning win in Game 2 later in the day.

That left the title and a World Series berth down to Saturday's game at Corning. Like they have most of the season the Red Barons dominated cruising to a 19-2 victory.

""(Friday) even though we lost 3-2 we were down 3-0 going into the bottom of the seventh inning and we scored two runs. So these kids have been fighters the whole year and we almost joked today it was like poking the bear"" CCC coach Stacy Johnson said. ""We had gone 32-0 the kids felt a little bit of pressure and I think the loss was the best thing that could happen to us. After the loss we outscored them 28-2.

""So it was a good wakeup call that we were real and we could be beat and they had to focus on their job. In my opinion it was the best thing that could have happened to us.""

Corning improved to 34-1 and captured its first Region 3 championship since 2004.

Region 3 softball includes two brackets. Herkimer swept Jefferson 12-4 and 11-3 on Friday to take the B side of the region.

Mohawk Valley finished with an 18-7 record.

How they did it

Corning whose roster includes 12 players from the Elmira-Corning area came out swinging in the deciding game. Thomas A. Edison graduate Hailey Burdick hit a three-run homer for CCC in a four-run first inning.

The Red Barons extended their led to 8-0 through two innings with local graduates coming up big again. Odessa-Montour alumna Grace Vondracek and Horseheads graduate Jill Murray smacked RBI doubles. Burdick contributed a two-run double in the frame.

Corning put together another four-run inning in the fourth to extend its advantage to 12-1.

Corning's Jayden Hill was named tournament Most Valuable Player after picking up wins on the mound in the last two games.

Burdick and Murray earned all-tournament honors.

What it means

Appearances in regional finals have become commonplace for the Red Barons over the last 12 years or so. Crossing the threshold as Johnson put it was a different story until Saturday.

""It's been our goal in our program for a long time but especially with this group of kids"" she said. ""They wanted to be the ones to do this again. That's been their goal all year long and that's been all they've talked about and all they've focused on and they did it.""

Johnson a former standout player at Elmira Southside and Ithaca College is nearing 600 career wins since taking over as Corning's coach in 1998. She guided CCC to a third-place national finish her first season and a runner-up showing in 2004. CCC won the national title in 1997.

Al Falkowski head varsity coach at Horseheads the previous two seasons is Johnson's assistant.

Up next

The Red Barons will play for the national championship at the eight-team double-elimination Division III World Series to be held May 27-29 at Carrier Park Field of Dreams in Syracuse.

""It’s exciting for these kids to have the opportunity"" Johnson said. ""We talked about the season is three books. It’s a trilogy. We had our regular season which we finished 30-0. Playoffs which we went 4-1. And this is book three. This is icing on the cake. Our goal was not to be undefeated this year our goal was to win a regional championship and go to the national tournament. And we reached our goal. Anything that happens after this is just a bonus.""

“It’s my party and I’ll rage if I want to 🔥” she captioned the saucy snap on Saturday May 15.

McHale who was also Uskowitz’s “Shomance” podcast cohost shared a series of photos from the memorable weekend on his social media pages.

“We’re getting married!” he joked on Saturday via Instagram showing off the group’s desert pad. McHale’s second photo revealed a close-up of the former costars smiling with the California scenery as a backdrop.

Ushkowitz’s bachelorette crew also included Vampire Diaries alum Kayla Ewell podcast host Amanda Macuga fitness guru Mary Miller Memoirs of a Geisha actress Sam Futerman and Show Me Your Mumu cofounder Cammy Miller.

The Piper Point property’s value is largely because it has 131 feet of frontage on unusually deep water according to the Los Angeles Times. That means it can accommodate large yachts.

The property has two docks and four moorings for that purpose making it one of the area’s largest privately owned marina facilities attached to a home according to Forbes Global Properties.

For that it appears Murdoch paid the full asking price for the roughly half-acre property.

The house is an entirely renovated two-story boat shed with a living area on the top floor and a luxury take on a workshop below possibly for working on boats.

The living area has two bedrooms and a modest common space under vaulted ceilings. The lower level leads to a small lawn and swimming pool.

Its Murdoch’s biggest real estate deal since he bought L.A.’s Chartwell Estate for $150 million in late 2019. Earlier that year his father sold 21st Century Fox Inc. to Walt Disney Co. for $12 million which was distributed to the younger Murdoch and his siblings.

Lachlan Murdoch has been working at the upper echelons of his father’s companies since 2014 following a roughly 10-year hiatus. He is widely seen as his father’s successor to run those companies and was named Chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation shortly after the Disney deal.

A day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines saying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in most places some stores dropped their mask requirements for customers. Walmart Costco Sam’s Club Publix and Trader Joe’s are just some of the big-name stores that have already made the change saying fully vaccinated people can go mask-free except where a mask is required by state or local mandates.

The stores still say unvaccinated people should wear masks. “In accordance with CDC guidelines individuals who are not fully vaccinated are required to use face coverings over their noses and mouths while inside any Publix store” the grocery store chain said in a statement for example. But really the change is just a blanket green light for anyone to shop without a mask because there is no way employees could corroborate the vaccination status of their customers. “We will not require proof of vaccination but we ask for members’ responsible and respectful cooperation with this revised policy” Costco said in a statement updating its mask policy. The stores are also allowing most vaccinated employees to go mask-free.

Even as some rushed to changed their policy other stores are taking a slower approach and have made clear they aren’t ready to change yet. Apple for example said that it will be keeping its mask requirements at its retail stores for now. Kroger the largest supermarket chain in the country also said it wasn’t changing its mask requirements for now as did Home Depot and Target. Walgreens also said it is keeping the mask mandate for now in part because its stores are “a destination for COVID vaccine and testing.”

Some have cautioned against being too eager to drop masks. Unions representing grocery store and retail workers said masks should still be required for now. The new CDC guideline “fails to consider how it will impact essential workers who face frequent exposure to individuals who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear masks” Marc Perrone president of United Food and Commercial Workers’ union said. Writing in the New York Times Zeynep Tufekci says that it isn’t clear why the CDC had such a major change of heart on masks so quickly. “The C.D.C. shift does not seem to fully account for the risks to the great number of unvaccinated people or the immunocompromised especially those working indoors” Dr. Tufekci writes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9jZWxlYnJpdGllcy8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L3JpY2t5LXNjaHJvZGVyLXZpZGVvLWNvbmZyb250aW5nLWNvc3Rjby1lbXBsb3llZS1vdmVyLW1hc2stcmVxdWlyZW1lbnQvNTEyMTk0OTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ricky Schroder confronts Costco employee over mask requirement,"Ricky Schroder former ""Silver Spoons"" and ""NYPD Blue"" star can be seen confronting a Costco employee about recent mask mandates in a video shared on social media.

In the video which was posted to Schroder's Facebook page the 51-year-old asked a Costco employee why he wasn't allowed inside the store unmasked.

""Because in the state of California and the county of Los Angeles and Costco there has been no change to our mask policy"" the employee whose name is Jason responded.

Schroder's video comes days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that people who are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 do not need to wear masks in most indoor and outdoor spaces.

“You didn’t see the news?” Schroder replied. “Nationwide Costco has said you don’t need to wear masks.”

Several retailers including Costco dropped their face-covering requirements in wake of CDC's announcement but according to CEO Craig Jelinek only at ""locations where the state or local jurisdiction does not have a mask mandate.""

However both California and Los Angeles are still implementing mask requirements.

""Actually that’s not accurate. What is accurate is that Costco always goes above and beyond when following the law and the mandate in California has not changed"" the employee added.

Schroder continued: ""The people in power? You’re going to listen to these people? They’ve destroyed our economy. They’re destroying our culture. They’re destroying our state. And you’re just going to listen to their rules?""

He then asked for a ""refund from Costco"" and called for people to ""give up your membership to Costco until they remove this (mask mandate).""

In November 2020 the actor was seen taking photos with Kyle Rittenhouse who was accused of killing two people and injuring one during a protest in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake a 29-year-old Black man who was shot and injured by police in August.

Schroder also partially paid for Rittenhouse's $2 million bail which put Rittenhouse's bond fundraising effort ""over the top"" according to attorney L. Lin Wood.

“Yes there has been. You didn’t see the news? Nationwide Costco has said you don’t need to wear masks” Schroder replied referencing the recent news that Costco is no longer requiring masks inside their stores.

However the no-mask policy only applies within states and jurisdictions that no longer have a mask mandate. California and Los Angeles County both still require masks inside establishments.

“Actually that’s not accurate” Jason said. “What is accurate is that Costco always goes above and beyond when following the law and the mandate in California has not changed.”

Schroder then launched into an anti-mask rant saying: “Oh if they allow us? If they grant us that our kings? The people in power? You’re going to listen to these people? They’ve destroyed our economy. They’re destroying our culture. They’re destroying our state. And you’re just going to listen to their rules? I’m getting my refund. I’m getting my refund from Costco. I suggest everybody in California get their refund from Costco. Give up your membership to Costco until they remove this.”

Jason kept his composure simply responding that “this hasn’t changed in any building in California in any company that I’m aware of. The places I shop still require masks. But that’s not the point. The point is that Costco is simply abiding by the law.”

Schroder has been a continuous subject of controversy due to his beliefs. In November 2020 it was revealed that Schroder had donated an undisclosed amount of money to the bail fund of Kyle Rittenhouse the 17-year-old gunman accused of killing two protesters in August in Kenosha Wis.

In a video posted to his Facebook page Sunday former ""Silver Spoons"" actor Ricky Schroder argued with a Costco employee who wouldn't let him inside the store without a mask.

""Why aren't you letting me in"" Schroder can be seen saying. ""Nationwide Costco has said you don't need to have masks.""

The situation illustrated how the CDC's new mask guidelines and the policy announcements from companies like Costco Walmart and Trader Joe's that followed are confusing and in some cases angering people.

According to both Costco's and Walmart's websites the stores are allowing people in without masks but only at locations where there are no state or local mask mandates.

While Governor Gavin Newsom said on Friday that's he's considering whether and when to adopt federal mask guidelines California's mask-mandate remains in place until at least June 15.

However LA-are Trader Joe's stores told CBSLA that they are allowing customers who are fully vaccinated to shop without wearing masks.

Not everyone was aware of the new mask policies and some of those who did know about the new guidelines said they didn't yet feel comfortable shopping without their masks on.

""Even if you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you should always do it"" a Trader Joe's customer said.

It's unclear whether the state will communicate with private businesses that are lifting the mask mandate against statewide guidelines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2VsZWUvMjAyMS8wNS8xNi84MHMtc3RhcnMtc2NvdHQtYmFpby1yaWNreS1zY2hyb2Rlci1jcml0aWNpemUtY29zdGNvLWZvci1yZXF1aXJpbmctZmFjZS1tYXNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,80's Stars Scott Baio Ricky Schroder Criticize Costco For Requiring Face Masks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/05/16/80s-stars-scott-baio-ricky-schroder-criticize-costco-for-requiring-face-masks/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2VsZWUvMjAyMS8wNS8xNi84MHMtc3RhcnMtc2NvdHQtYmFpby1yaWNreS1zY2hyb2Rlci1jcml0aWNpemUtY29zdGNvLWZvci1yZXF1aXJpbmctZmFjZS1tYXNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It was 1969 a high point for motorists motels and neon along Colfax. The Royal Palace occupied one of the busiest corners in town.

Its glimmer faded as the years went on and the storied avenue became seedier. The motel closed in 2013 and has sat vacant and boarded up ever since.

Some ideas for the property have been suggested in recent years. At a candidate forum in 2018 mayoral candidate Chairman Seku told a crowd that the city should turn the Palace's empty rooms into space for people without homes. The city actually fielded a proposal to do just that though there's no indication the idea went anywhere.

But there are signs something may finally happen at 1565 Colorado Blvd. Last week the motel's owner filed a certificate of demolition eligibility with the city. It's basically a document that says the landlord can apply to destroy or alter the structure any time in the next five years. It doesn't mean something will actually happen but it's a sign that someone is thinking seriously about the Royal Palace's future.

Jeff Oberg whose D.B.T Ventures LLC owns the building did not respond to questions about his plans for the site. D.B.T. Ventures bought the building in 2004 for $850000.

The Royal Palace's history tells a larger story about East Colfax.

When someone files a certificate of demolition eligibility it sets off a research process to determine if a building is worth saving. City workers dive into buildings' histories and report back to the public.

Denver Landmark Preservation's filing on the Royal Palace spins a tale of high hopes and steady decline.

John T. Norton announced plans for the hotel in 1967. Conceptual drawings by architect Richard T. Crandall showed an ambitious agenda for the ""twin eight-story helical structures"" built in an ""expressionist"" style that contained 300 rooms with balconies. Between the towers they envisioned a ""conical gourmet lounge"" suspended in mid-air.

But that vision had been downsized by 1969 when an ad in the Denver Post announced a 70-room motel that looked more like its neighbors along Colfax.

""It is unknown why Norton's original concept fell through"" the Denver Landmark report reads. ""Given the scale of the motel proposed the budget and complex engineering were likely an issue.""

Still the Palace was an icon of its time. It embodied the ""the golden era of motels along Colfax"" when the wicked avenue was motorists' main route into town. Its eventual decline was symbolic of the ways I-70 which rose through Denver in the mid-'60s affected Colfax.

""Tourists who had previously driven Colfax Ave. through Denver now had the option to bypass central Denver and continue to the mountains or to stay at new chain hotels established along I-70"" the Landmark report says. ""However development along E. Colfax in Denver continued during the 1960s.""

Meanwhile the city worked to push sex shops and topless bars out of its downtown corridors. Many of those businesses reopened on East Colfax bringing a new character to the street as tourists took other routes into town.

""Colfax became known as a crime-ridden street"" a Denver Post reporter wrote in 1993. ""It has never been able to shake that image.""

The Royal Palace's reputation turned with the neighborhood. It was the site of a still-unsolved murder when a man named John Eggers was found shot in a room by a staffer in 1998. Its only review on Yelp from 2010 describes the motel as ""very icky.""

""Even though this motel was cheap I do not advise that anyone stay here"" reviewer Jessica S. wrote. ""I opted to sleep in my clothes.""

No matter how yucky it became inside the Royal Palace's exterior has continued to capture nostalgia. In particular a group of Colfax preservationists have angled to save its funky sign. It's a mash-up of ye-olde script and '60s flare a blue-and-gold crest beneath a crown topped by a disco ball.

Jonny Barber a champion of Colfax history known as the ""Velvet Elvis"" said he's been talking with Oberg the owner to preserve the piece. It's part of a broader effort to ""save the signs.""

""I'd probably be happy with just the disco ball I think it'd be amazing"" Barber told us.

He said Oberg was open to working something out he just had to nail down some details. Our conversation was the first he'd heard of any movement for the property.

""I'd better get a hold of him soon"" he said.

(AP) — Even as railroads are operating longer and longer freight trains that sometimes stretch for miles the companies have drastically reduced staffing levels prompting unions to warn that moves meant to increase profits could endanger safety and even result in disasters.

More than 22% of the jobs at railroads Union Pacific CSX and Norfolk Southern have been eliminated since 2017 when CSX implemented a cost-cutting system called Precision Scheduled Railroading that most other U.S. railroads later copied. BNSF the largest U.S. railroad and the only one that hasn’t expressly adopted that model has still made staff cuts to improve efficiency and remain competitive.

The railroads acknowledge they have cut staff lengthened trains and made other adjustments to reduce spending but they are adamant none of the changes increase dangers. Regulators at the Federal Railroad Administration say they are tracking the changes and that the data so far does not show the new operating model is unsafe. But unions counter that with the stakes so high any time a train derails the new system is risky.

“Every time the wheels come off the rail it’s kind of like buying a lottery ticket to the big disaster” said Jason Cox with the carmen division of the Transportation Communications Union.

Precision Scheduled Railroading calls for running fewer longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. The railroads also operate their trains on more of a set schedule now with fewer stops and pickups and they have eliminated shorter less-profitable routes.

By increasing the length of trains railroads can reduce total trips cut down on the number of engines and railcars needing maintenance and manage with fewer employees. Some trains now stretch longer than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers). Union Pacific said the average of its maximum train length has grown more than 30% to 9250 feet which is 1.75 miles (2.8 kilometers) since it started using the new operating model in 2018 and the railroad is expanding track sidings throughout its network to accommodate much longer trains.

The railroads say they abide by federal regulations for car and signal inspections and that human inspections are supplemented by high-tech systems that can scan tracks and railcars for defects.

They also say safety has improved overall over the past five years. All the major railroads issued statements defending their safety records and citing investments they have made in their networks.

“Across the board I do not see evidence of our workforce at Union Pacific being rushed overworked or put in harm’s way. I just don’t see it statistically” said Lance Fritz CEO of Union Pacific the nation’s second-largest railroad.

CSX officials said most of the key safety measures they track like employee injuries and train accidents have improved since it started using the Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model.

“We do not move freight at the expense of the safety of our employees or the communities where we operate” CSX spokeswoman Cindy Schild said.

The head of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio last week asked the Government Accountability Office to study Precision Scheduled Railroading’s impact on safety and the industry overall.

Independent expert David Clarke director of the University of Tennessee’s Center for Transportation Research said the safety data is inconclusive.

“Right now I just haven’t seen anything to demonstrate that it’s definitely having a negative impact on safety” Clarke said.

However the union coalition Transportation Trades Department notes the amount of time carmen have to inspect each car in a train has been reduced by more than half — from three minutes to just 60 seconds. Also staffing cuts mean less-trained train crews are often handling those inspections the group says.

“From the conductor side we’re basically finding things that are just obvious” said Greg Hynes national legislative director with SMART-TD union that represents conductors.

The unions also say that most signalmen who maintain railroad crossing guards and safety signals along the rails have seen their territories grow by 150% leaving little time for maintenance work once required tests are completed.

“As maintenance gets neglected. then obviously the failures go up” said Tim Tarrant a vice president with the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen.

Overtime is also up which the unions say increases fatigue and the chance that a safety defect could be missed.

Unions acknowledge it’s part of their mission to maintain or increase staffing levels but members said they’re more motivated by the potential for disasters such as a 2013 derailment in Canada that killed 47 people in the town of Lac Megantic and caused millions of dollars in damage or a 2005 derailment in Graniteville South Carolina where nine people were killed and more than 250 treated for exposure to toxic chlorine gases.

Former CSX employee Kasondra Bird said safety concerns led her to resign in December after 24 years with the railroad even though she didn’t have another job lined up. As a conductor operating trains by remote control in a Grand Rapids Michigan railyard she went from switching 150 cars a day to 300 to 350 each shift.

Bird said some workers skipped meal and bathroom breaks to keep up.

“I was hoping to stay a lot longer but if it means my safety it’s not going to do me any good staying another day if that means I’m not going to come home” said Bird who is a 45-year-old single mother. “Safety and the well being of employees have definitely taken a backseat to production.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHA6Ly9jYXltYW4ubG9vcG5ld3MuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZmluYW5jaWFsLXNlcnZpY2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyLXBhcmxpYW1lbnRhcnktc2VjcmV0YXJ5LXJlY2VpdmUtYnJpZWZz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Financial Services Minister & Parliamentary Secretary receive briefs | Loop Cayman Islands,"Minister for Financial Services and Commerce André Ebanks and Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services Katherine Ebanks-Wilks have been briefed by senior managers in the Ministry’s statutory authorities on current operations and initiatives.

Which Of These FOUR Light & Heavy Duty Trucks Rules The Drag Strip?,"Images: TFLtruck

Curious about four light & heavy-duty trucks battling it on the drag strip? Oh yea you are and so are we!

We know that you guys are chomping at the bit to see light & heavy duty trucks go head to head to see which one is quicker in an eighth of a mile – right? Well we are answering the call! On top of that these trucks will be featured in towing hauling and performance videos soon. That’s important too but you guys came for the smackdown – right?

Here are the light & heavy duty trucks

2021 Ford F-250 Tremor – 7.3-liter gas V8

2021 Ram 2500 HD – Cummins diesel I6

2021 Ford F-150 Hybrid pickup truck – Hybrid turbo V6

2021 Ram 1500 – Hemi V8 with eTorque

Why no General Motors Toyota or Nissan trucks? We will be getting these vehicles soon. In fact: we’ll get some Chevrolet products next week. We will cram to get as many trucks on the Ike Gauntlet as soon as we get them while the weather is still good. Andre tries to drive these vehicles in similar conditions. Unfortunately between the Covid-19 and chip delays mixed in the unpredictable weather – our timing is… challenging.

Still Andre is undaunted and he will get to more trucks directly.

As for this drag race: yea the outcome is fairly predictable. You’ve seen most of these vehicles battle before. Knowing this we also added our Solo DL to each race to measure 0 to 60 mph in each truck. Initially we were interested in how different each powertrain is. Remember: we are racing an HD diesel against an HD gas and a hybrid vs a beefy gas V8. Very different powertrains. The gap was wide but there were a few surprises.

Bancroft along with Steve Smith and David Warner was suspended by Cricket Australia in the aftermath of the ‘Sandpapergate’ where television cameras captured Bancroft using sandpaper to tamper with the ball kicking off a domino effect that caused a major upheaval in Australian cricket.

Bancroft who has played two Ashes Tests since the 2018 incident having served a nine-month ban in the middle was speaking ahead of his county stint with Durham when he reopened the conversation about the events of March 2018.

“Yeah look all I wanted to do was to be responsible and accountable for my own actions and part” he said when asked if bowlers in the team were aware of the tactics. “Yeah obviously what I did benefits bowlers and the awareness around that probably is self-explanatory. I guess one thing I learnt through the journey and being responsible is that’s where the buck stops [with himself]. Had I had better awareness I would have made a much better decision.”

When asked specifically if the bowlers knew Bancroft was quoted as replying: “Uh… yeah look I think yeah I think it’s pretty probably self-explanatory.”

Mitchell Starc Josh Hazlewood Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon were Australia’s four frontline bowlers in the game.

Bancroft and captain Smith had appeared before the media after the end of play on day three confessing that an attempt had been made to alter the condition of the ball. Smith had admitted that the ‘leadership group’ was aware of the tactics without naming those involved. A press release by Cricket Australia later announced that Smith and vice-captain David Warner had decided to step down while coach Darren Lehmann too resigned from his role shortly after.

According to findings from Cricket Australia’s investigation “prior knowledge of the incident was confined to three players Steve Smith David Warner and Cameron Bancroft” which would appear to be conflict with Bancroft recent statement.

Former CA chief executive Kevin Roberts in 2019 had said that an anonymous ‘integrity hotline’ had been set up for any further evidence but no reports had been made.

“We’re really serious about addressing any unresolved issues and we’re sincere in the way we’re going about that. So if there are any reports or allegations as opposed to innuendo then we will investigate that thoroughly” he had said.

CA has since reiterated in a statement that the investigation can be reopened if novel allegations come to light.

“CA has maintained all along that if anyone is in possession of new information in regards to the Cape Town Test of 2018 they should come forward and present it” the statement read.

“The investigation conducted at the time was detailed and comprehensive. Since then no one has presented new information to CA that casts doubt on the investigation’s findings.”

Carroll ‘24

News Editor

In an email addressed to members of the Trinity College community on Wednesday May 12 President of the College Joanne Berger-Sweeney announced the retirement of Chair of the Board of Trustees Cornelia Parsons Thornburgh ‘80. Berger-Sweeney indicated that Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer at CVS Health Lisa Bisaccia ‘78 will succeed Thornburgh as board chair.

Thornburgh became the first female chair of the board upon assuming the position in 2014; she has been active on the board through varying roles since 2004. Outside of Trinity Thornburgh served as a financial partner and chair of the advisory committee at Eachwin Capital. Also Thornburgh was a Vice President and Account Supervisor at J. Walter Thompson and a financial analyst at First Boston Corporation.

In her email Berger-Sweeney wrote that Thornburgh was one of the creators of the Trinity Women’s Leadership Council and the Marjorie Butcher Circle a “leadership philanthropy group of Trinity alumnae.” Furthermore Thornburgh served as a member of Trinity’s Board of Fellows co-chair of the Charter Committee for Building Community and chair of the College’s last capital campaign.

During her time at Trinity Thornburgh was the recipient of the Eigenbrodt Cup and last year was among the “50 for the next 50” which honors women “who will have a lasting impact on the next 50 years at Trinity.” Berger-Sweeney announced that upon its renovation the Vernon Social Center will be renamed the “Cornelia Parsons ’80 Center” making it the first campus building to be named after a woman. Additionally the Trustees honored Thornburgh during their April meeting with the “Cornelia Parsons Thornburgh ‘80 Women’s Leadership Fund” which will “support a range of activities at Trinity related to women’s professional development and growth as leaders.”

When asked about her hopes for Trinity in the years to come Thornburgh informed the Tripod via an emailed response in April that “Trinity is well poised and on an excellent trajectory for its next 100 years. It gives me great pride to anticipate our bicentennial celebrations especially knowing that my transition will bring strong leadership with the election of new board Chair Lisa Bisaccia continued capable guidance by a more than able administration and of course ongoing inspiration from our visionary president. Combine this leadership with a talented and dedicated board a top-tier faculty and staff highly accomplished and motivated students and we have the right ingredients for a future that will be shaped by our bold and independent thinkers.”

Thornburgh added that “Given this past tumultuous year of pandemic protest and politics it’s only reasonable to anticipate that Trinity just as those throughout Higher Education will face hurdles ahead. Fortunately we have a clarity of vision moxie and determination to succeed. I am nothing if not optimistic about our future.”

That same month Bisaccia who will succeed Thornburgh as board chair told the Tripod in an emailed response that “My goals are to support and promote the strategic initiatives that will differentiate the college from peer institutions make it a first choice school for students faculty and staff and one that its alumni will be eager and proud to support.”

Bisaccia further stated that “The Board of Trustees must continue to support the curriculum and the faculty that administer it. We must continue to reach out to our alumni base and make sure our graduates understand that even as the college adapts to changing times many of the things that make Trinity special will endure as embodied by the close relationships between faculty and students our commitment to liberal arts as the best preparation for the future and our connection to the Hartford community among others. We must continue to admit and retain bright engaged and talented students remain firm in our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion in all its forms and strengthen the college’s endowment. If we are successful in these areas then I think Trinity not only will maintain but confirm its standing as the preeminent liberal arts college in an urban setting in this country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51bmlvbmxlYWRlci5jb20vdm9pY2VzL2NpdHlfbWF0dGVycy9jaXR5LW1hdHRlcnMtbmV3LWNsdWJob3VzZS1uZXctY3ZzLWxvY2F0aW9uLWEtd2luLXdpbi9hcnRpY2xlX2E0YjFiMmU5LTNkNDItNTYyZS04OTE2LWJlZGFlMDg5OWRmMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City Matters: New clubhouse new CVS location a win-win,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The analysis uses several calculations to ascertain how much energy the Bitcoin network uses and how it stacks up against the banking and gold industries.

In the opening section the authors note that the energy usage criticisms are not usually applied to traditional industries. It lauds Bitcoin (a carbon footprint that’s been compared to Las Vegas) for being transparent while incumbent companies are opaque and don’t often disclose their energy footprint.

Gold and banking systems

The authors accept that the Bitcoin network consumes a great deal of energy but assert that this is exactly what secures the network and makes it so robust. By Galaxy Digital’s calculation the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin is estimated to be 113.89 TWh/yr. For some perspective the energy consumption of always-on devices in the US is 1375 TWh/yr — 12.1 times that of Bitcoin’s consumption.

The consumption of the gold and banking industries are hard to estimate because of a lack of data on energy usage. This makes it difficult to “have an honest conversation” about Bitcoin’s energy use.

For the gold industry the analysts took a look at all of the processes involved including those directly emitting greenhouse gasses those indirectly emitting them and emissions stemming from refinement and recycling. Multiplying the total 100408508 tCo2 in emissions with the global IEA carbon intensity multiplier it estimates the total energy consumption of the gold industry to be 240.61 TWh/yr.

The report describes the banking industry as being harder to gauge because it does not directly report electricity consumption data. However it takes banking data centers bank branches ATMs and card network data centers. With this rough categorization of sources of power consumption the banking industry’s energy consumption estimate is 238.92 TWh/year — 2.3 times that of Bitcoin.

Narrative now centering on Bitcoin’s energy usage

The report follows Tesla’s decision to stop accepting BTC for payments out of concerns for its energy usage. Bitcoin’s energy consumption has been a narrative thread for years but only with recent headlines has it become a prominent one.

However the real argument supporting Bitcoin’s energy consumption is that the value it brings can justify it to some degree. Galaxy Digital notes that value is subjective and that the mainstream public is still on the fence about Bitcoin’s utility.

Galaxy Digital’s report considers the arguments posed by detractors those who see it as complementary to incumbent systems and ardent supporters. To detractors it says that Bitcoin can bring financial inclusion and families in economically and politically unstable countries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFscy9jcmFpbnMtZWRpdG9yaWFsLWxpdHRsZS1oZWxwLWhlcmUtdmFjY2luYXRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crain's editorial: A little help here on vaccinations,"Nothing about COVID has been easy. And yet when it comes to the most important part of the response to the pandemic — vaccinating the public — the (relatively) easy part is done.

As of last Tuesday May 11 58.5% of U.S. adults or nearly 151 million have received at least one dose and 44.7% or about 115 million are fully vaccinated according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A lot of those people to use a business cliché are low-hanging fruit — the ones who were always going to get vaxxed needed no convincing and had the freedom in their work schedules to take time off to do it.

As a result the U.S. has a seven-day average of 38826 new coronavirus cases per day — a number that has not been below 40000 for nearly eight months. That's the good part. The red flag is that since the middle of April as The Atlantic noted the vaccine campaign has slowed. The U.S. is administering about 2.1 million shots per day down from 3.4 million shots about a month ago even though there's enough supply to give more.

Businesses are among the institutions that can play a role in helping to raise vaccination rates.

The move by many vaccination sites to offer shots without appointments will help. So will mobile clinics and initiatives such as one announced by CVS Health which will introduce employer-based vaccination clinics through its ""Return Ready"" program. Axios pointed out that a recent Kaiser Family Foundation study found nearly 25% of Americans were more likely to get a vaccine if it's available at their workplace. Among people who said they wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible but haven't done so yet the top reasons preventing that move were ""busy/didn't have time"" and ""can't take time off work/conflict with work hours."" The potential of needing extra time off due to vaccine side effects also weighs heavily on many people.

Those findings are consistent with a study released last week by Cleveland's Center for Community Solutions which reported that the inability to miss work ""contributes to vaccine hesitancy and likely lower vaccination rates.""

There's a particularly strong connection the study found between lower vaccination rates and people who are either part-time/seasonal workers or who work full-time with annual incomes below $35000 which the Center for Community Solutions used as a proxy for hourly workers. The less secure the income source the less likely a person is to find time to get vaccinated.

Kate Warren one of the study's authors pointed out in an interview that the federal government last month announced that employers with fewer than 500 workers are eligible for a tax credit to cover paid time off (PTO) for employees who take time off related to COVID-19 vaccinations. The study itself noted ""There is still work to do to ensure that employers are aware of the credit."" The credit exists to help smaller businesses reduce their costs while enabling employees to take time needed for vaccination.

Consulting firm McKinsey recently released recommendations that support vaccine adoption among employees by making vaccination as convenient and ""costless"" as possible. It encouraged for instance that employers support vaccination scheduling for their workers by reserving appointment slots at nearby vaccination sites to minimize wait and travel times. Employers also could provide incremental sick days or PTO for vaccination and any needed recovery time offsetting potential structural challenges that might prevent workers from getting vaccinated. Additionally employers could adjust shift times and scheduling to accommodate employee vaccination appointments particularly during working hours.

Every employer's situation is a different and accommodations are easier in some industries than others. And yet employers are all in the same position. It's to companies' benefit particularly when workers are difficult to find that larger numbers of people are vaccinated because it creates a bigger pool of healthy available workers and limits the emergence of dangerous new variants of the virus. Small investments to boost vaccinations can pay big dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3Mvc3VycHJpc2UtY2RjLXJldmVyc2FsLW1hc2tzLWxlYXZlcy1zdGF0ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1zY3JhbWJsaW5nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3NjkxNzY50gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvUG9saXRpY3Mvc3VycHJpc2UtY2RjLXJldmVyc2FsLW1hc2tzLWxlYXZlcy1zdGF0ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1zY3JhbWJsaW5nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3NjkxNzY5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surprise! CDC reversal on masks leaves states businesses scrambling,"If you’re going to CVS or Target bring your mask. But if you swing by Trader Joe’s or Starbucks you can leave it in the car assuming you are fully vaccinated of course. That said if you’re taking public transportation to get there you’ll need to mask up for the ride.

After 405 days of urging every man woman and child to wear a mask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stunned much of the nation this week -- including health experts – with its recommendations that vaccinated Americans can mostly ditch the mask. The decision left businesses governors and schools scrambling to respond and an emerging hodgepodge of rules for masks depending upon which state county or store a person is in.

The new CDC proposal also raises serious questions: Can employers require proof of vaccination before a worker goes mask-free? Should businesses ask patrons to present proof upon entry? Could teens eligible for the vaccine be denied access to a classroom without a mask if they aren’t vaccinated?

Governors said they weren’t briefed in advance on the plan despite 24 states and the District of Columbia having some sort of state-wide mask mandate in place at the time of the announcement.

""We were as surprised as anyone by the CDC’s announcement – learning about it through the press"" said Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire calling CDC messaging in recent months ""inconsistent convoluted and ever changing.""

In Maine Gov. Janet Mills told reporters she was ""anxious"" to hear from the CDC how to distinguish between vaccinated the unvaccinated people. But by Friday Mills announced she was on board and that the state would adopt the CDC guidance as state policy.

Several health experts also said were caught off guard assuming new mask recommendations would come when more Americans were fully vaccinated. Nearly 36% of the U.S. population is vaccinated and the pace of shots has declined.

""I thought it would be prudent to wait until everyone who is willing (ages 12 and up) has had an opportunity to be fully vaccinated around July 1"" said Linsey Marr a virus transmission expert at Virginia Tech.

Dr. Leana Wen an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University's Milken School of Public Health tweeted: ""I’m still stunned at the CDC decision.""

The White House too claimed to be unaware of precisely what the new recommendation would be making the case that the CDC came to its conclusion without political pressure. Press secretary Jen Psaki said only a ""small number"" of people at the White House knew about the proposal Wednesday night.

""The White House was informed of that decision just to give people assurance of that"" Psaski told reporters Friday.

When asked what the CDC guidance means for Biden’s executive order that mandates masks be worn on federal property Psaki said it may take a few days for any possible changes but she expects ""the guidelines will be the guide.""

""We're working to implement those [guidelines] across the government"" she said.

Several big-chain stores also seemed surprised firing off terse statements that mask mandates would remain in place until they had a chance to review the new recommendations and determine which businesses might be subject to local mandates.

""These conflicting positions put retailers and their employees in incredibly difficult situations"" said Lisa LaBruno a senior executive vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

For its part the CDC defended the new guidance as a natural next step based on emerging scientific evidence including fresh studies that the vaccines were holding up against variants of the virus and cutting asymptomatic transmission. The CDC also cited plummeting case numbers and a recent decision by regulators that kids as young as 12 now qualify for vaccination.

""We have had a coalescence of more science that has emerged just in the last week"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky director of the CDC told reporters when asked what had changed in the past 16 days since the agency last released mask guidance.

Under the new recommendations people who are fully immunized should feel safe removing their masks in almost all circumstances even indoors and in a crowd. The guidelines call for masks to still be worn on planes trains and buses as well as homeless shelters hospitals and prisons.

While the CDC insisted its decision was grounded in science it seemed to acknowledge that it was unprepared to answer the questions that would come with it. In an interview with NPR’s ""All Things Considered"" Walensky said the recommendation would trigger a review of other guidance.

""What we really need to do now as an agency is comb all of our guidance not just for travel but for schools and for camps and for child care centers and for all of the guidance that we have out there … And that is going to be the work of the weeks ahead that we have in the agency"" Walensky told NPR on Thursday.

John Brownstein chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor said one primary concern is that the U.S. is still experiencing active disease transmission with more than 35000 COVID cases a day. Also some vulnerable populations including children don't have the option of getting vaccinated.

That puts everyone on the honor system and many people and businesses confused on how exactly to stay safe he said.

""Americans are feeling incredible whiplash"" Brownstein said.

The Clifton changed the conversation around maximally-cushioned footwear when it debuted in 2014 nullifying what runners considered a traditional trade-off between lightweight performance and supportive cushion. It quickly became one of the most popular HOKA styles and earned its status as a daily mileage workhorse for beginners and serious runners alike – a reputation that has been reinforced through seven iterations. The next generation of this ultimate runner's running shoe the Clifton 8 continues to deliver the unprecedented weight-to-cushion ratio that has made it a favorite for its simultaneous smooth support and up-tempo capabilities.

""We have always viewed the Clifton as an 'overachiever'"" said Gretchen Weimer Vice President of Product at HOKA ONE ONE. ""Each version has exceeded the expectations of runners both in the amount of innovation built into such a lightweight shoe and in the experience they have while wearing it. The Clifton is also designed to empower runners to reach their next level and 'overachieve' on their own goals. The '8' is no exception and it's arguably the most overachieving rendition yet of this game-changing shoe.""

Smooth On Down the Road

The Clifton 8 remains insanely light while improving on durability and the smooth-riding experience it provides runners at every pace. The most significant update is an all-new ultra-light midsole foam designed to offer a soft cushioned impact while adding an energetic response with each step. It also features a new engineered mesh upper designed to be ultra-light highly breathable and resilient enough for athletes to put this shoe through any workout. The wide base provides a degree of inherent stability while an ultra-plush tongue and refined Achilles pull tab are designed to make this the most comfortable edition of the Clifton to date.

""We hear from so many runners that the Clifton is a 'perfect' shoe but we know it can be even better and we aren't willing to stop pushing for innovation and improvement"" said Weimer. ""We knew that we had to proceed very carefully with this update tweaking the areas of opportunity we identified without undercutting the features that have made the Clifton so popular. Our team successfully walked that line with the Clifton 8 to produce a really incredible update that has really enhanced the ride experience.""

The Clifton 8 is available at hokaoneone.com and at HOKA dealers worldwide. MSRP $130.

Dan Knebel was appointed Wednesday by the board and will represent Director District 4 which includes Barclay Township. The appointment is temporary though. The position will be on the ballot in the Nov. 2 school board election.

Knebel who grew up in Dunkerton and graduated from the high school expressed excitement about serving on the board and said that he enjoys volunteering. He moved back to town two years ago after 15 years in Cedar Falls. During the past 24 years though he has been involved with coaching basketball in the district.

“So been tied to the school for pretty much my entire life” he noted. His decision to get licensed for substitute teaching gave him yet another tie.

The board accepted the resignation of current District 4 member Amber Shimp effective June 1 during a special meeting March 31. According to the meeting minutes she and her family are moving out of the school district.

Knebel was approached by Kirby Marquart board president asking if he’d be interested in serving in the role. As someone without any children Knebel initially questioned the idea. Then he thought “Well actually maybe I’d be a really good fit a different perspective.”

With only six months before the term ends Knebel noted it also provides a point where he could evaluate a potential run with the possibility of continuing to serve on the board.

He praised Shimp who is a friend as someone who “does a whole lot for the school system. She’s going to be hard to replace sad to see her go.”

Knebel has done handyman and landscaping work since leaving John Deere in September 2019 after more than 15 years with the company. At John Deere he had roles in project management dealing with budgets and working with multiple groups of people.

He said his experience at the company could be “pretty beneficial” to the board.

Board secretary Amy Morley said several people initially expressed interest in serving in the position one of five on the board.

After Dunkerton Schools posted a notice saying people could petition to fill the vacancy by special election an effort to submit a petition got underway. However officials learned from the Black Hawk County elections office that under Iowa Code Shimp’s resignation date was too close to the regular election to allow for a special election. It has to be 180 days or more for residents to have the option of petitioning for a special election.

Beginning Sunday Delta Air Lines customers can use the airline’s Covid-19 test-mandatory flights for non-essential travel to Italy without needing to go through the standard quarantine period. As a result the Atlanta-based airline will expand its offering to cities in Italy including increased frequencies to Rome and Milan and reinstated service to Venice.

To utilize these flights travelers are required to submit a PCR Covid-19 test at most 72 hours before departure submit to a rapid Covid-19 test at the airport and submit to a rapid Covid-19 test upon arrival in Italy. If both tests all come back as negative passengers are free to travel to Italy exempt from quarantine. Meanwhile on the way back to the U.S. travelers are required to submit a Covid-19 test 72 hours before departure.

Italy plans to implement these policies from May 16 to July 30 on flights to Canada Japan the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. It is unclear which other airlines will take advantage of these new rules.

Currently the airline offers three services to Italy including a daily flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport to Milan a five-times-weekly service from Atlanta to Rome and a three-times-weekly service from New York to Rome. Flights from Atlanta to Rome and New York to Rome are intended to switch to daily service on May 26 and July 1 respectively.

These flights are operated with the airline’s 293-seat Airbus A330-300 with 34 seats of DeltaOne in a 1-2-1 configuration 40 seats of Comfort+ in a 2-4-2 configuration and 219 economy-class seats in a 2-4-2 configuration.

Additionally Delta Air Lines plans to launch and reinstate additional services to Italy. Its three new routes include the resumption of flights from Atlanta and New York to Venice and the launch of flights from Boston to Rome which was delayed from its initial scheduled start in 2020. Daily flights from New York to Venice commence on July 2 while five-times-weekly services from Atlanta to Venice and daily services from Boston to Rome start on Aug. 2.

These routes will be flown using the airline’s Boeing 767-300ER featuring 26 seats of Delta One in a 1-2-1 configuration 35 seats of Delta Comfort+ in a 2-3-2 configuration and 165 economy-class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration. All the flights above will be operated in cooperation with its Italian transatlantic partner Alitalia.

“Delta was the first U.S. airline to launch quarantine-free service to Italy and our Covid-tested flights have proved a viable means to restart international travel safely” Delta’s Executive Vice President Alain Bellemare said. “It is encouraging that the Italian government has taken this step forward to reopen the country to leisure travelers from the U.S. on our dedicated protocol flights and further supporting economic recovery from the global pandemic.”

Signs of Recovery in Europe

Italy is one of the latest countries to implement some form of reopening policy in Europe. Croatia Greece and Iceland have gotten started with the reopening of their countries for vaccinated travelers which has led to Delta’s expansion of its services to the three countries.

The Atlanta-based carrier plans to add new daily services from Athens to Atlanta in July and Boston to Reykjavik on May 20. Two weeks ago Delta Air Lines announced new services from Dubrovnik to New York-JFK amid the easing of restrictions in Croatia.

However they are not the only airline taking advantage of these policies. United Airlines has utilized these guidelines to launch new routes to Dubrovnik Athens and Reykjavik from its hubs in Newark Washington D.C. and Chicago.

These moves come amid promising signs toward reopening. In April the president of the European Commission hinted at reopening its borders in months ahead. Additionally France and Spain are taking steps to reopen their borders to vaccinated individuals the summer.

Date: May 15 2021

By Mark Finlay Simple Flying

Launched in the corner of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in an abandoned terminal in 1981 People Express was the brainchild of former Texas International Airlines CEO Don Burr. Inspired by Britains Freddie Laker and his low-cost Skytrain flights People Express offered fares lower than its competitors.



It was able to do this by making its employees owners of the airline. This meant that no matter what your title was you would help out where ever necessary. Pilots would help load luggage while sales personnel would help out at the check-in counters. This allowed People Express to have one of the highest employee productivity rates in the industry.



People Express used Boeing 737s

Operating using a Boeing 737-100 People Express first flew from Newark to Buffalo New York before adding flights to Columbus and Cleveland Ohio Norfolk Virginia and Jacksonville Florida. By December of 1981 People Express had 42-weekday departures to destinations up and down the east coast and midwest.

Unbundling the various components of air travel People Express allowed passengers to pay for what they wanted and more importantly not pay for what they did not want. One carry-on item was free but if you wanted a checked bag it would cost you $3. Likewise the food and drinks that other airlines included in their fares were add-on items with People Express who charged a dollar for a beer and 50 cents for a can of soda.

People Express gambled that passengers without baggage and those who were not so keen on airline food would be prepared to fly People Express to save big on the airfare. For the first three years in business it looked like Burr and the others who set up the airline were right. For once following the deregulation of the industry People Express was letting the marketplace dictate the policies and prices. Not only was People Express offering low-cost tickets but it was also forcing other airlines to cut their ticket prices as well.

People Express took on the big three

Despite its initial success by flying routes with little or no competition in the United States People Express got too big for its own boots and decided to take on the bigger established airlines. Soon the low-cost carrier was offering flights to Chicago and Dallas despite United Airlines and American Airlines regarding the two cities as belonging to them. When People Express began offering flights to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) Delta Air Lines was not too pleased.

In 1983 People Express much in the same way as Freddie Laker had done became a household name in air travel when it introduced $149 one-way flights from Newark Liberty to London Gatwick (LGA) on May 26 1983. Using a leased former Braniff International Airways Boeing 747-227B People Express flights to London were an instant hit with flights almost always fully booked.

Now on everyone’s radar and having annoyed the big three carriers in the United States People Express began to learn what it was like to play in the big league. The first lesson for People Express was that American Airlines United Airlines and Delta Air Lines do not surrender their home turf easily.



When you take on the big three you are no longer competing solely on price as they will match your fares dollar for dollar no matter how low you go. You will also find yourself competing with their automated booking systems and codeshare agreements with other airlines. Lastly and perhaps more importantly you are competing with their frequent flyer programs.



People Express bought Frontier Airlines

Now fully on the radar and knowing what they were up against most people expected People Express to back off and concentrate on secondary markets that American Delta and United were not interested in. Instead of this People Express did the opposite purchasing Denver-based Frontier Airlines for $300 million in 1985.

At the time Frontier was on its last legs following a bitter fare war with United Airlines and Continental Airlines that Frontier was losing. The move by People Express had analysts wondering had People Express made a brilliant business move or a massive blunder.

Buying Frontier Airlines not only burdened People Express with debt it did not need but it also alienated Frontier Airlines passengers with its no-frills approach and caused labor struggles with Frontier Airlines employees. With its heavy debt load People Express decided to change its philosophy and lure lucrative business travelers. Cabins were redesigned to include a first class section and a frequent flyer program was introduced as People Express looked to copy mainstream carriers.



In the end massive debt proved to be the downfall of People Express with the airline forced to work with an investment bank as it looked for a buyer and a way out of trouble. People Express was bought by Texas Air Corporation and merged into Continental Airlines in February 1987. Headed by Frank Lorenzo Texas Air Corporation paid around $125 million in cash notes and assumed all People Express debt.



According to the aviation enthusiast website Planespotters.net People Express operated a fleet of 17 Boeing 737-100s five Boeing 737-200s and ten Boeing 747 aircraft during its brief six-year life span.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mYWEtc2FuLWRpZWdvLXJ1bndheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAA Investigating Near Miss Runway Incident At San Diego,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mYWEtc2FuLWRpZWdvLXJ1bndheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Autonomous vehicles and devices are very much a part of modern society with delivery robots autonomous and self-driving cars gaining a foothold in the world.

Each one of these breakthrough technologies requires advanced data and processing skills to function both efficiently and safely. Some of this is currently available but additional infrastructure is needed to make this technology mainstream and reliable in every corner of the country.

Even home appliances and everyday services provided by software companies need a wide reach.

The owners of EdgeX a new data center in Oklahoma City believe their business (which is housed in an old Devon Energy facility) can help usher in this new era in Oklahoma. The EdgeX Data Center will house massive banks of computer servers for clients which could include large tech companies that need to move computing power closer to their own customers.

""It's called 'the move to the edge'"" said John Parsons who launched EdgeX with fellow data center veterans Terry Morrison and Octavio Morales.

The ""edge"" in this case refers to the edge of where end-users and their tech products interact with the rest of the world. By having high-quality data centers in smaller and smaller markets distributed geographically the distance between two computers that need to communicate with each other is significantly reduced .

""They still have their big mega facilities but then they are leasing space in smaller facilities in these tier two and tier three markets and putting part of their server infrastructure that can communicate with their clients in the Top 100 cities for instance"" Parsons said.

Parsons and his team's business strategy is to give these tech companies another place to house their infrastructure that's not just in top-tier markets like Dallas or data center hubs on the coasts.

""The technologies that are being advanced and going forward such as autonomous vehicles autonomous drones all types of (artificial intelligence) those are massive amounts of data that rely on instant speed"" he said. ""So that's where the real big play on the edge is.""

The 65000-square-foot building at 4442 Newcastle Road contains 3000 square feet of office space and two massive rooms that can house racks of servers totaling 20000 square feet.

Parsons said he's already in talks with potential clients who could start importing their servers into the building.

""We're not looking to piecemeal this out rack by rack. This is a wholesale data center opportunity for big tech"" he said.

Another 42000 square feet of the facility contains all of the support infrastructure needed to keep the building operational and includes both air- and water-based cooling systems along with redundant backups and emergency power generation.

The concrete walls 18 inches thick are designed to withstand the most devastating tornadoes and wind at over 300 miles an hour. If a tornado comes too close the building automatically seals itself off from the conditions outside with large metal shutters and blast doors.

Devon built the facility in 2010 to handle the company's substantial computing needs but sold it to EdgeX in April.

Parsons and Morrison an experienced data center engineer co-founded Perimeter Technology Center nearly 20 years ago and grew it to be the largest commercial data center provider in Oklahoma. They sold PTC in 2011 to TierPoint.

Oklahoma City's EdgeX facility likely won't be the only one Parsons and his partners launch. He's in negotiations for a second data center in Oklahoma and is looking at another three outside the state.

The company notified investors it is launching a quarterly cash dividend program later this year (the first payable on June 10 to shareholders of record May 24) that will have an annual rate of $1.375 per share.

Mike Wichterich Chesapeake's board chairman and interim CEO described the company’s first-quarter performance as being “strong.”

Chesapeake achieved an average production of about 436000 barrels of oil (equivalent) daily during the first quarter with about 77% of that natural gas.

The company is operating seven rigs — three in Appalachia three in the Haynesville shale and one in south Texas.

Following Chesapeake's emergence from Chapter 11 restructuring the company generated $409 million of operating cash flow ending the quarter on March 31 with $340 million of unrestricted cash on hand.

The company also parted ways with former CEO Doug Lawler on April 30. Mike Wichterich who joined Chesapeake earlier this year to lead a new board of directors at the conclusion of the company's bankruptcy restructuring is currently serving as an interim CEO while the board searches for Lawler's permanent replacement.

Witchterich said none of the company's board members are seeking to become Chesapeake's permanent CEO moving forward.

How did other Oklahoma energy companies do?

Devon Energy posted a net profit of $213 million or 33 cents per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $1.8 billion or $4.82 the same time a year ago.

It produced an average of 268000 barrels of oil daily exceeding guidance by 5000 barrels with the help of its Delaware Basin production. At the same time it kept its upstream capital expenditures for the period below projections spending $447 million.

Continental Resources meanwhile posted a first quarter net income of about $260 million or about 72 cents per share.

The company updated its expected full-year cash flow to $3.1 billion or about $1.7 billion free cash provided West Texas Intermediate oil stays at $60 a barrel and natural gas stays at $2.75 per million British thermal units at Henry Hub.",,,,,,

Three simple words that puck a lot of punch. Perhaps a gut punch to the state being left behind but more importantly a fistful of dollars for the state rolling out the welcome mat.

Moving is never easy. Neither is the decision to move especially when you’ve planted roots in a place that nurtured your growth. Whether for personal reasons or corporate ones choosing to leave your hometown to find greener pastures is often complicated and fraught with risk.

You weigh the pros and cons. You evaluate your potential new home against the merits of your current one. And you consider the impact of the move on everyone else — not just the people going with you but perhaps more importantly the people you’re leaving behind.

That’s why what happened in 2020 and continued happening in 2021 is so remarkable. Never in U.S. history have so many Americans elected to change addresses.

Photo: Getty Images Austin TX

According to the National Association of Realtors 8.93 million people relocated between March and October of 2020. That marked an increase of nearly 94000 people changing addresses compared to the 8.84 million who moved during the same period in 2019. The spring and summer months brought the most relocations but the traffic jam of moving vans that began in March 2020 never truly subsided.

American households however were not the only entities engaging in a mass exodus. As the pandemic wore on companies followed suit. What started as a trickle of relocating firms over the summer turned into a tidal wave in the fall and winter as corporate executives did the math and found it didn’t add up to remain in high-tax high-cost high-regulation places.

As Site Selection Editor-in-Chief Mark Arend chronicles in his story about corporate headquarters relocations in this publication once a few high-profile names made the switch to Texas others found it easy to follow. Digital Realty Trust moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Austin. Rex Teams left Seattle for Austin. Wesco Aircraft relocated from Santa Clarita California to Fort Worth. And the granddaddy of them all Oracle said goodbye to Silicon Valley and hello to Austin.

Moves like these were a big reason why Texas won the coveted Site Selection Governor’s Cup trophy for a record ninth consecutive year. Texas claimed the crown by securing 781 corporate facility projects in 2020 nearly doubling the output of second-place Ohio.

Never in U.S. history have so many Americans elected to change addresses.

Why do so many companies make this decision? It’s easy to cite the statistical foundation for these capital-intensive moves but in reality the decisions go much deeper than accounting. Citing cost of living tax rates incentives and regulatory environments makes for a compelling case that satisfies the CFO and shareholders. But doing that alone ignores three fundamental factors: an aggressive governor; an overall philosophy of governance; and a state that refuses to concede to the competition.

Gov. Greg Abbott took a lot of heat in early March when he announced his decision to fully reopen Texas but business leaders loved him for it. The Texas Restaurant Association spoke for many when it said: “For the thousands of local restaurants on the brink of closure and the 167000 Texans that remain unemployed in our industry alone there’s finally a light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel.”

Abbott made that bold move because of his bedrock belief in the power of freedom to unleash the best that Texans have to offer. He outlined his philosophy of governance when he recently told me “Businesses have almost total freedom to run their company the way they see best. We can’t run their businesses better than they can. We get out of their way and let them do what they do best.”

Finally Texas never quits trying to be the best state at attracting jobs and industry. Not even after a decade of dominance in the prestigious Site Selection Governor’s Cup competition. That’s why Gov. Abbot and lawmakers in Texas continue to tinker with tax and regulatory policy to make the state even more competitive. And it’s why Texas continues to fund government-led economic development better than any other state in the nation.

In other words get ready to see those three words — Gone to Texas — a whole lot more in 2021 2022 and beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2020 Beethoven (1770-1827) will have seen the light of day only 250 years ago

An occasion that the museum could not fail to celebrate Bourdelle is undoubtedly one of the artists most influenced by music but also from the figure – in a physical and symbolic sense – of the German composer. Based on identification this obsession translates into a plethora of heterogeneous works: Bourdelle reserved around eighty sculptures for Beethoven but also around twenty drawings and photographs. Populated with sculptures photographs drawings and archives ""Bourdelle devant Beethoven"" illustrates the story of an obsession perhaps even of a filiation if we want to re-read Bourdelle's confession to him. – Indeed: “In my turn with tenacious premeditation he said. “

Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was born in Bonn 250 years ago. A quarter of a millennium. This anniversary gives rise to numerous European commemorations in Germany as in France. The Musée Bourdelle takes the opportunity to celebrate the Beethoven year with a new exhibition. Antoine Bourdelle is undoubtedly one of the artists most influenced by music but also by the figure – in a physical and symbolic sense – of the German composer. On the basis of an identification this obsession translates into a plethoric corpus of heterogeneous works: Bourdelle reserved around eighty sculptures for Beethoven as well as around twenty drawings and photographs.

The visitor immersed in two different atmospheres: one clear and bright will be confronted with the many carved faces of Beethoven conceived by Bourdelle as many variations around a cursed face of a sovereign interiority; the other dark and dramatic will attempt to expose the methods and sources of this incorporation but also to make dialogues sculptures photographs and drawings to penetrate the secrets and subtleties of this great identification. Beethoven was for Bourdelle more than a father a brother a mirror double a traveling companion whose path already crossed could show him the way at a time of doubts and joys.

Antoine Bourdelle (1861-1929). Beethoven. Crayon in graphite and aquarelle on paper. Paris Bourdelle museum.

Beethoven is a complete artist but also a cursed one. His frantic scores consoled and sublimated the deafness he suffered from. With him from him artists have scrutinized their most intimate passions and darkest nights torments and visions electrifying joys and metaphysical anguish. This maturity of sensibility which prefigures Romanticism and soon after Expressionism has been an object of obsession for painters and sculptors alike. In other words all those soul seekers who from Austria to Japan from Sweden to the United States claimed the composer as their aesthetic ancestor.

Under the auspices of Beethoven and especially his fascinating mask of life – cast from his face when he was alive - artists try to find their way often turning their gaze inward. When Antoine Bourdelle (1861-1929) was just 20 years old and studying in Toulouse he discovered Beethoven's music and quickly identified with ""the soul of a master"". In addition the composer's disheveled hair gloomy expression and high aspirations were similar to his. While the sculptor would sometimes sacrifice social niceties for a concert he admitted hearing Beethoven ""only by heart"" rather than ""constant listening"". He preferred to approach him through readings sketches photographs and above all the approx 80 sculpted portraits that Bourdelle made of the composer from 1888 until his death in 1929. They are like many variations of an enchanting leitmotif.

The new exhibition made up of sculptures photographs drawings and archives bears witness to the illustrious story of an obsession perhaps even a sort of father-son relationship if we revisit Bourdelle's own admission: ""I in turn with tenacious meditation resumed where it left off ”.

Depending on where you live there's a good chance you regularly pass a Dollar General store. According to Supermarket News the brand of small footprint stores experienced tremendous growth in 2020. The company operates at least 17177 stores across 46 states making it a well-recognized brand for most people.

These neighborhood stores offer a wide variety of low-cost options on things your household likely uses every day. Many of the items for sale are great deals. From toilet paper to snacks to essential household items it is tempting to grab everything you need in one quick and easy stop.

However Reader's Digest warned that there are some items like over-the-counter drugs and beauty products that you shouldn't buy at these discount retailers. Another one of the items the publication warned against — extension cords and power strips — might be something you've purchased or considered purchasing at your local Dollar General. There's a big reason why you shouldn't though.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYm9vbWFuZGJhbGFuY2UvbG9uZ3RpbWUtaGFybGV5dmlsbGUtbWF5b3Itd2luZHMtZG93bi10ZW51cmUtaW4tcnVyYWwtdG93bi1kZXNpcmluZy15ZXQtcmVzaXN0aW5nLWNoYW5nZS9hcnRpY2xlXzUxZjIzMjU4LThkNmItMTFlYi04YzA1LTA3ZGI5OWNjZTA3Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Longtime Harleyville mayor winds down tenure in rural town desiring yet resisting change,"HARLEYVILLE — There's a woman who lives in the mobile home neighborhood with two of her young children. And then there's the couple on Mill Street — they're expecting their second child. A woman has started remodeling a home on Kate Street while another family is getting ready to move to Brazil.

Charles Ackerman has met them all.

As mayor of Harleyville for 27 years Ackerman makes it a point to meet everyone who lives in this town stretching 1.7 miles from end to end at least once.

""That's the advantage of living in a small town you get to know everyone individually"" Ackerman said. ""I like that personal touch because if a resident has a problem they know who they can come to. I always tell them I might not remember their name but I'll always remember their face.""

Many of the faces have changed since Ackerman and his wife Deloris moved to Harleyville in 1990 (he became mayor four years later) but the rural character of the town of roughly 700 residents has remained intact. People still relax on front porches brightly decorated with hanging flowers and more often than not an American flag. A monument along Main Street pays respect to Harleyville's fallen veterans and residents wear their small-town pride literally on their chests: Employees at the Just Desserts cafe sport T-shirts proclaiming ""I'd Rather Be In Harleyville.""

But while progress seems to move at the same slow crawl as the CSX Corp. freight trains that bisect Main Street Ackerman knows change is headed toward the outer edges of Dorchester County.

""We have a lot of real estate companies coming in wanting to buy land and wanting to know what we can provide for them and where the water and sewer is"" he said adding the town's proximity to Interstates 26 and 95 could make Harleyville a prime industrial location.

Ackerman and other residents are conflicted about that potential.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpc2l0b3JuYXNodmlsbGUuY29tL3Bvc3QvZHVlLXRvLWx1bWJlci1zaG9ydGFnZS1yZW5haXNzYW5jZS1mZXN0aXZhbC1rbmlnaHRzLXdpbGwtam91c3Qtd2l0aC1wb29sLW5vb2RsZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Due to lumber shortage Renaissance festival knights will joust with pool noodles,"

Dollar stores are to today's shoppers what five-and-dime stores were to older generations: a place where you can fill your cart and still come away with change in your pocket. That's why people keep flocking to Dollar General for their household needs. According to Insider the bargain chain is giving Walmart a run for its money; in 2019 alone it opened nearly 1000 stores many in rural areas where residents would otherwise have to travel long distances to pick up staples.

Although Dollar General isn't a literal dollar store — most items cost more than $1 — they still offer a huge variety of items at prices lower than you'll see at your local supermarket or department store. A representative circular shows family-sized Kellogg's cereals at two for $7 six rolls of Bounty towels for $4 (after using a digital coupon) and an assortment of bubble wands sidewalk chalk and other summer kids' necessities for (yes!) $1 apiece.

With a Dollar General within just a few minutes' drive from most American households it seems crazy to pay extra for your greeting cards laundry detergent and toothpaste anywhere else. Still there are some items that are best bought from a specialty store rather than a rock-bottom chain like Dollar General.

EDGARD — Academic signing day is a rite of passage for graduating seniors at West St. John High School in Edgard. Students are surrounded by family members and peers as they celebrate the future proudly putting pen to paper to announce which academic institution they will attend after high school.

The entire school watched as 21 seniors penned their future plans during the annual signing day ceremony held Thursday morning in the West St. John High School gym. Principal Claude Hill Jr. has come to love the tradition in the six years he’s been at the school because he sees the way it inspires underclassmen to succeed.

“The importance is not just for the families and students to understand their commitment but for the younger generation to also see the commitment and the effort and energy they carry in order to receive a scholarship for academics or athletics” Hill said. “I think it’s important for the younger generation to see that to catapult them into their future endeavors and understand that they want to set goals and one day have a scholarship offer too.”

The following seniors were celebrated:"

Scalping or the practice of buying cards at retail value then selling them to shops or online for a much higher price has boomed in recent years.

The returns on trading cards are better than the S&P 500 stocks these days according to research from the PWCC Market Index. Now's a breaking point.

A fight broke out at a Milwaukee Target store over cards and only ended after one person pulled out their gun. On May 14th Target suspended sales at stores nationwide including in Sioux Falls.

“The safety of our guests and our team is our top priority. Out of an abundance of caution we’ve decided to temporarily suspend the sale of MLB NFL NBA and Pokémon trading cards” said Target in a statement to the Argus Leader.

In Sioux Falls and nationwide the trading card phenomenon has left many Dollar Tree Family Dollar Target and Walmart stores empty on a regular basis for the past several months. Many stores now keep cards behind their counters due to shoplifting or fights. And even Sioux Falls collectible stores have seen the impact.

""Cards we stocked today will be gone by this weekend"" said John Nordstrom Comics Manager at Rainbow Comics Cards & Collectibles on 3310 S. Minnesota Ave.

Rainbow takes in used and sells new and used cards in good condition. They sell them often above retail price at market value. One employee mentions they strip through about 10 binders full of sports cards a week from someone coming in looking to sell them and that by far Pokémon is the most popular trading card set flying off the shelves.

""Ebay changed the game"" Nordstrom said. ""These guys come in and know they can sell cards they get here online right away for a profit. It's pricing kids out of the game.""

Rainbow says it has to make its own mixed packs just so kids can try their first packs. Other cards like a rarer Kobe Bryant go for $200 or more.

“We grew in 2017 18 19. In 2020 Covid hit and it just exploded” said Dennis Worden owner of Triple Play Sports Cards across town on 3816 Western Ave.

Worden claims his sales have gone up about 150% since last year and that Triple Play has trouble keeping rarer NBA cards on the shelves. The store is selling Pokémon due to popular demand.

Indeed sports cards auctions have grown massive lately. A Luka Dončić NBA card sold for $4.6 million dollars this year. And a Mickey Mantle card sold for over $5 million as well. Eight of the 10 most expensive trading cards in history have all sold in 2021.

In the end the committee stuck to academics with impressive resumes cutting four quasi-internal candidates who were either employed by the university or who held deep Tallahassee ties.

Candidates selected to move forward next week for on-campus interviews with faculty staff and students were:

Robert Blouin  executive vice chancellor and provost University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.

 executive vice chancellor and provost University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Richard McCullough vice provost for research Harvard University.

vice provost for research Harvard University. Giovanni Piedimonte M.D. vice president for research at Tulane University and professor of pediatrics in the Tulane School of Medicine Tulane University.

Whoever is ultimately chosen will replace FSU President John Thrasher who has led his alma mater to a Top 20 national public university ranking completed a $1.1 billion Raise the Torch campaign and commands wide respect by the Florida Legislature and the Board of Governors.

Thrasher 77 announced his intention to retire last fall. He has served as FSU’s 15th president since November 2014.

Not making the cut were:

David Coburn vice president and director of intercollegiate athletics Florida State University.

Randy Hanna dean and CEO of Florida State University-Panama City.

Richard Corcoran Florida Education Commissioner and former Speaker of the House.

Sean Pittman Tallahassee lawyer/lobbyist; CEO Pittman Law Group.

Mary Ann Rankin former senior vice president and provost University of Maryland-College Park.

Michael K. Young president emeritus and professor of law and professor of public policy Texas A&M University.

Search committee chairman Bob Sasser a member of FSU’s Board of Trustees and executive chairman of Dollar Tree said that landing on the three candidates from an initial pool of 35 was hard work but that the finalists are strong candidates.

“Looking at the opportunities for Florida State University I think the committee saw the backgrounds of each and as we move forward into a Top 20 university the committee considered highly the people they thought could bring us into the Top 10 in the next several years"" Sasser told the Democrat.

Thrasher who was inside Ruby Diamond but not visible during the interviews and discussions said he thought the search committee conducted an open and transparent process.

“I think it was a very deliberate open forum of great information presented on all nine candidates” Thrasher told the Democrat. “The search committee deliberated hard transparently and I think they came up with the decision they thought was in the best interest of Florida State University.""

But the post-lunch discussions Saturday were not without some tense moments.

It opened with Alberto Pimentel managing partner of the search firm Storbeck/Pimentel and Associates presenting the committee with the top three names that seemed to represent the consensus of the body from his perspective: Blouin McCullough and Piedimonte each of whom has extensive research backgrounds and are all leaders at coveted Association of American Universities membership schools.

But that didn’t sit well with FSU trustee and search committee member Craig Mateer who pushed to have more conversation on each candidate rather than going on what Pimentel said was the consensus.

Specifically Mateer pushed to have Corcoran added to the list of finalists. Mateer said Corcoran has the legislative know-how to help FSU get appropriations needed to move the university forward.

Mateer blasted the involvement of Belle S. Wheelan president of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges which accredits FSU and other universities.

More:Richard Corcoran wants to be FSU president. He's also on the hiring board | UPDATE

On Thursday Wheelan sent a letter to Board of Governors Chairman Sid Kitson suggesting that considering Corcoran for the presidency could ultimately result in FSU being out of compliance with the commission’s standards on qualifications and conflict of interest and put the university at risk of losing accreditation and funding.

Corcoran is an ex-officio member of the Board of Governors (BOG) of Florida's State University System the appointed body that oversees Florida’s public universities and the one that ultimately will approve the hire of the next president. The BOG chair responded that there was no compliance issue and Corcoran could recuse himself if he was selected.

However Mateer said Wheelan’s letter which came late in the process and was widely circulated by critics of Corcoran was used to scare away support for a Corcoran presidency.

“I feel like the letter written regarding Mr. Corcoran was inappropriate” Mateer said.

Mateer went so far as suggesting that Wheelan’s letter should be reviewed by Florida’s ethics commission.

Eric Silagy the BOG representative on the search committee agreed that the letter was inappropriate.

“I am disappointed that the president (of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges) would write a letter with a lack of information"" she said adding that ""this letter has zero influence.”

FSU General Counsel Carolyn Egan explained countered that the accreditation commission “has its own standards” and Corcoran’s nomination could have repercussions.

“Based on what we know moving forward with that candidate poses some risks to FSU” Egan said.

A motion to add Corcoran’s name to a list of finalists failed to get any traction.

Committee members also suggested revisiting Pittman Rankin and Young if there was support to add a fourth candidate.

Christian Hall a recent FSU graduate and search committee member said Pittman offered racial diversity to the mix as well as someone with extensive legislative experience. He noted strong support from alumni for Pittman.

“I feel we would do a disservice to FSU if we did not consider him” Hall said.

However the panel ultimately decided to stick with the three finalists already selected.

Next up the three finalists will be interviewed by faculty staff students and community members at open forums on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday.

Depending on where you live there's a good chance you regularly pass a Dollar General store. According to Supermarket News the brand of small footprint stores experienced tremendous growth in 2020. The company operates at least 17177 stores across 46 states making it a well-recognized brand for most people.

These neighborhood stores offer a wide variety of low-cost options on things your household likely uses every day. Many of the items for sale are great deals. From toilet paper to snacks to essential household items it is tempting to grab everything you need in one quick and easy stop.

However Reader's Digest warned that there are some items like over-the-counter drugs and beauty products that you shouldn't buy at these discount retailers. Another one of the items the publication warned against — extension cords and power strips — might be something you've purchased or considered purchasing at your local Dollar General. There's a big reason why you shouldn't though.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmxhbmRvc2VudGluZWwuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvbG9ja2VkLW91dC1sb3ctcGF5LXNvYXJpbmctcmVudHMtcHJvLWxhbmRsb3JkLWxhd3Mtc2V0LXVwLWZsb3JpZGEtcmVudGVycy1mb3ItZXZpY3Rpb24tb25jZS1jb3ZpZC1oaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eviction crisis in Florida exposed by COVID-19,"Jocelyn Bennett paints her daughters’ toenails not bothered by the strong scent of nail polish filling the room at the HomeTown Studios in Orlando. The girls show off their pink toes toddling around the small pay-by-the-week hotel room one of many the Bennetts have called home since the pandemic began and they got evicted.

It’s just one room with a bathroom with not enough space to even open the front door all the way. But it’s got a stove and a fridge and it’s better than living in their car or outside. There are two beds one for mom and dad and the other is shared by their five kids who are all under 6 years old.

These days a bottle of Dollar Tree nail polish is one of the only luxuries Jocelyn Bennett can give them.

“That’s the worst feeling to have is I can’t provide for my kids. That’s probably the worst feeling you can have as a parent not knowing what to do and calling 2-1-1 and them not knowing what to do” Jocelyn 26 said referring to United Way’s emergency hotline.

In March 2020 Jocelyn lost her nursing assistant job at a senior living facility. Dexter her husband had been between jobs finding work through a temp agency. They were already on food stamps. In April they couldn’t cover the rent. Their landlord told them they needed to be out in 30 days. And the family became homeless in a matter of weeks.

“It was a downward spiral after that” Dexter 36 said. “Since COVID started we’ve been living in hotels.”

For renters in Florida this is what eviction can look like. It doesn’t always play out in a courtroom because many renters can’t get a court hearing which results in their landlord automatically winning the case. Some people like the Bennetts leave without responding to an eviction notice because they don’t think they can fight it.

Housing experts argue Florida has some of the harshest eviction laws in the country written so landlords can evict people as quickly as possible and without going to court. During the COVID-19 outbreak those landlord-friendly laws coupled with the state’s severe shortage of affordable homes rising rents and years of stagnant wages left thousands of suddenly jobless renters exposed. And even after the government ordered a halt to eviction proceedings and federal dollars were made available to help people pay rent many tenants were not spared.

Dexter and Jocelyn Bennett with their five children at a HomeTowne Studios by Red Roof on Tuesday April 13 2021. The family is living in a pay-by-the-week hotel after getting evicted from their Tallahassee home in March 2020 after Jocelyn lost her job and the family couldn’t pay the rent. They’ve been hotel-hopping since.

Black Floridians who were already more likely to lose their job to the pandemic and die from COVID-19 were even more likely to be locked out of their homes. In a mostly Black part of downtown Orlando for example renters were about six times as likely to face eviction than in another mostly white part of downtown according to new data compiled for the Orlando Sentinel by the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies at the University of Florida.

Shimberg estimates more than 57000 evictions were filed in Florida just from March 2020 to mid-December pushing families like the Bennetts into homelessness at a time the government was ordering people to quarantine.

Central Florida renters many of them the same low-wage workers who power the region’s tourism economy were particularly vulnerable. Even before the pandemic and mass layoffs upended their lives they lived paycheck to paycheck in a town where rent keeps climbing and wages don’t budge.

So when the bottom fell out of the tourism and service industries there was no safety net for them and Florida’s Republican-controlled Legislature did nothing to help.

“They are the ones who face wrongful eviction they are the ones who can’t get living wages they are the ones who are struggling to find reliable public transportation. It’s all on them” said state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith a Democrat from Orlando. “And when we ignore these crises with affordable housing eviction wages public transit — we’re doing it on the backs of working people.

“They are the ones who pay.”

Renters struggled before COVID

Florida ranks among the states with the worst affordable rental housing shortages in the nation data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition show. New housing has been added to try to keep up with the state’s population growth but developers have largely ignored building places to live for low-income residents.

Over the past 20 years in Florida nearly 200000 rental units priced under $1000 per month disappeared as landlords increased rents. At the same time about 1 million units priced above $1000 were added the Shimberg Center found.

And as rent increased pay lagged. Since 2005 Florida’s minimum wage has gone up by just $2.50. It won’t hit $15 per hour — $31200 annually for full-time workers — until 2026 a voter-mandated move that’s expected to lift millions of Floridians out of poverty and help close pay gaps for women and people of color.

Because wages haven’t grown Diane Yentel president of the NLIHC said many neighborhoods are still out of reach for renters. NLIHC found an Orlando resident would have to make $23 an hour or a $47840 yearly salary to afford a two-bedroom rental that costs $1248 per month.

“There was a way for lower-income workers in our country decades ago to be able to afford housing in a way that’s simply not possible today” Yentel said.

Some of the most common occupations for renters in Florida — housekeepers cashiers janitors restaurant cooks and servers — not only pay some of the lowest wages but they were also at the businesses most likely to shut down and conduct mass layoffs to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.

Those workers were some of the 1.4 million Floridians displaced by mass layoffs last spring who struggled to collect unemployment benefits and the same renters who later faced eviction.

“They were barely hanging on before COVID” Yentel said. “When you pay so much of your already limited income towards your rent you’re always one financial shock away from missing rent and being evicted in the worst cases becoming homeless. Pre-COVID that financial shock might be a natural disaster or it might be an everyday disaster you know a broken-down car a sick child and missing a day of work.

“Last March the COVID-19 pandemic and its financial fallout was the financial shock.”

That was the case for Jocelyn and Dexter Bennett.

Before the virus their family didn’t make much but had enough each month to scrape together rent. They had the money from Jocelyn’s nursing job and Dexter had been finding construction and landscaping work through a temp agency. Now Jocelyn stays at the hotel with the kids — they can’t afford child care — and Dexter works at the Second Harvest Food Bank where he makes $400 a week.

It’s just enough to afford their tiny hotel room which costs $400 a week. Dexter also washes cars and tutors kids and food stamps help. Sometimes they get meals and toiletries and diapers from the One Heart for Women and Children food pantry.

But Dexter is thankful that at least his family is together. Last year after the eviction Jocelyn lived at a homeless shelter for a few weeks and the kids stayed with family. Dexter bunked with his dad in Orlando until he could save enough to move the family down from Tallahassee. Most of their belongings are still in storage.

“We’re just by the grace of God making it” Dexter said. “We’re trying to figure it out and by God’s grace we will.”

‘I’m just a person in a hard situation’

But the pandemic didn’t only displace low-income Floridians.

Alexiss Green 45 had worked for 20 years as a corporate accountant earning over $50000 a year. In 2019 she wanted to reinvent herself so she quit her job moved her two teenagers into a rental home in Clermont and used her savings to buy a fixer-upper the first investment in her new house-flipping business.

Three months after buying the property COVID hit and she couldn’t safely send out crews to work on it. She fell behind on the loan payments and is now working with the lender to relinquish the property. She lost entirely a second investment she made in a joint property.

Without any income paying the rent — $1850 for a four-bedroom house — became impossible. In September she found an eviction notice taped to the front door. She hadn’t paid rent since April 2020.

“I’m not a deadbeat person who doesn’t pay her bills I’m just a person in a hard situation” Green said. She said she understands her landlord has bills too “but I don’t have control over what’s going on in the world right now.”

Green wasn’t living in poverty before the pandemic but rent ate a big chunk of her income. She’s no different from many renters across the state.

In Florida 1.4 million of the state’s 2.7 million renter households across all income levels spend at least 30% of their yearly income on rent. Of those 938957 pay even more than that according to the Shimberg Center. That erodes the ability to save money or buy a house or even have a few months’ worth of savings to cover an unexpected expense.

Home prices have also dramatically increased making lifelong renters out of people who in another time could have afforded to buy a place. In 2000 the median price of a home in the Orlando market was $165649 when adjusted for inflation according to the Orlando Regional Realtors Association.

Today it’s $285000.

Homeowners are better protected

In Florida homeowners as a whole are on more stable financial footing after the foreclosure crisis in 2008 forced banks and lenders to toughen the requirements to qualify for a home loan. The median income for homeowners is $70486. In contrast renters make a median income of $42527.

Homeownership buys stability and the chance to build wealth. Most monthly mortgage payments don’t go up like rent and even during the pandemic home values improved.

Owning a home also means stronger protections against losing it. For example a federal foreclosure moratorium shields any person with a federally backed mortgage loan which covers about 70% of homeowners nationwide. From March 2020 to mid-December 7497 foreclosure suits were filed in Florida during the pandemic compared with 57381 evictions.

The eviction moratoriums imposed by the state and federal governments because of COVID prevented an immediate deluge of cases but thousands of renters who should have been protected slipped through.

From April through July 2020 when Gov. Ron DeSantis’ original eviction moratorium was in effect 8277 evictions were filed by landlords compared to the 40000 cases filed in a typical four-month time frame in the state. Then when DeSantis changed the moratorium’s wording to suspend just the “final action at the conclusion of an eviction proceeding” landlords started filing in droves.

There were 7370 evictions filed in August. In September there were 8922. In October another 10627.

Some tenants mistakenly thought they were automatically protected and didn’t have to answer a summons from the court. If they didn’t respond in five days that was grounds for an “automatic default” for the landlord.

Some homeowners laid off during the pandemic also got behind on mortgage payments. The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates 2.3 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.

But because the foreclosure process is much lengthier than evictions homeowners weren’t at risk of being homeless in weeks. By law lenders can’t file the first legal notice of foreclosure against a delinquent homeowner until four months after the first missed payment.

“We acknowledge that even in our system that you’re not likely to lose your house in a foreclosure in a matter of weeks” said Chief Judge Donald Myers who oversees the 9th Circuit Court in Orange and Osceola counties. “It’s likely going to take upwards of a year to make that happen.”

Most lenders also have programs to prevent foreclosure such as a short sale where the homeowner sells the house for less than what’s due on the mortgage and the money goes straight to the lender or transferring the title to the lender in exchange for the mortgage debt being erased or going into forbearance.

None of the options guarantees cancellation of the debt and can be blemishes on a credit report but they buy time to look for a job catch up on payments and keep people in housing.

“A homeowner just has protections that the renter doesn’t have” said Marissa Vetter a program director at the St. Johns Housing Partnership a nonprofit that helps distressed homeowners. “We’re going to see the crisis with homeowners it’s just they have a little more time.”

No guaranteed court hearing

The unequal protections for renters and homeowners exist in part because of changes by lawmakers that have all but eliminated the opportunity for tenants to explain to a judge why they’ve fallen behind on rent.

The way the law is now tenants have five days to deposit the money the landlord says they owe after getting a summons otherwise they waive all defenses and “the landlord is entitled to an immediate default judgment for removal of the tenant.”

Even access to a mediator who can resolve the case out of court hinges on tenants depositing the back rent.

“This particular statute is probably why Florida is in my opinion dead last in tenant rights out of all 50 states” said Jamos “Jay” Mobley senior housing attorney at The Legal Aid Society in Orange County. “You could have a great defense but you can’t present it unless you can pay upfront. Landlords know this and file questionable suits all the time knowing the tenant can’t come up with the amount they allege is due. And they win.”

Myers said that part of the law “defines the landscape” for evictions in the state.

“The statute is quite clear” Myers said. “When the Legislature put a requirement for a rent payment into the registry of the court within five days from service they were saying ‘We’re serious.'”

According to statistics provided by the courts 41% of eviction cases end in automatic default in Florida. Myers said he was surprised the number isn’t higher.

The Florida Apartment Association which represents mostly corporate landlords supports the deposit requirement because it limits the time landlords go without rent which they depend on to pay their mortgages and other expenses.

“While we completely understand some of the difficult financial situations that residents might find themselves in there is another side to this equation where you have a housing provider on the other side of it” said Amanda Gill a spokeswoman for the association. “What are you saying to them when they can’t pay their mortgage? I mean they’re not able to avoid foreclosure simply because they have a resident who is in pain.”

If they moved quickly and submitted the correct paperwork moratoriums gave tenants a way to at least delay eviction. But landlords have been finding ways to undermine the moratorium and groups that include the apartment association have sued the federal government to get it overturned.

A federal judge in Washington D.C. recently ruled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overstepped its authority when it issued the nationwide moratorium but the Department of Justice has appealed. If the moratorium is struck down Mobley said courts would have to revert back to strictly enforcing the rent deposit requirement.

The moratorium bought Green the mother of two from Clermont a hearing and a judge halted her case for six months. But a few weeks ago her landlord asked the court for another hearing because he said Green hadn’t followed the rules set by the CDC requiring tenants to make “best efforts to make timely partial payments” — despite the landlord having received $4000 in rental assistance.

‘Not asking for a handout’

Alexiss Green gets sworn in for her eviction court hearing which is held over Zoom on Wednesday April 7.

On the day of her Zoom hearing Green has her long braids pulled back from her face and is wearing one of her favorite pair of earrings with the Superwoman logo. Every few seconds she clicks the button to join the meeting anxious about being late. When it starts a judge and her landlord’s face pop up on the screen.

She doesn’t have an attorney to represent her — 90% of tenants facing eviction don’t — and Florida’s courts aren’t funded to provide public defenders for civil cases. She does her best to answer the judge’s questions pausing a few times to check her files and punch numbers into a calculator. She tells the judge about the rental assistance which she received from United Way and says she’s applied for more aid from Lake County.

She applied for an emergency loan through the Small Business Administration but was denied and has applied to office jobs but hasn’t had any luck. She managed to collect some unemployment and received stimulus checks but that money was used to pay other bills and buy food.

“I’ve been working since 16 and I’ve never had to use government assistance” Green says. “I am not asking for a handout but what I am asking for is to be able to remain under this moratorium for the safety and protection of myself and my children.”

Her landlord who’s in his 70s says he’s on a fixed income and is using Social Security payments to pay his mortgage. He doesn’t have a lawyer either.

A week later the judge’s ruling arrives in the mail. Green prays over the envelope before ripping it open. It’s bad news. The judge ruled she hadn’t made any “timely partial payments” even $5 or $10 a month. She has 10 days to move out.

Green shuts herself in her bathroom so her kids won’t hear her crying. “I don’t understand” she whispers. “I’m just totally numb right now. I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t know where to go.”

Alexiss Green packs up her four-bedroom rental home in Clermont on Wednesday April 21 2021 after being evicted.

The day before Green has to be out of her house she’s finishing packing and loading a moving truck to take the furniture to a storage unit.

Christmas ornaments the kids’ volleyball trophies a bowl of shells they collected on a family vacation are all shoved into black plastic garbage bags. The kids are in their rooms taking apart bed frames.

As she starts out of the driveway the next morning a deputy pulls up. She tells him the keys and garage door opener are on the kitchen counter. A friend in Davenport 45 minutes away offered Green her guest room and the kids are staying with their dad in Clermont another family separated by eviction.

But Green is trying to have faith.

“At the end of the day no matter how unfortunate this entire thing is there is something better on the horizon that I just can’t see yet” Green said. “But this is a circumstance I’m going to have to fight tooth and nail to come back from.”

A few days later Green gets an email from Lake County saying she’s been approved for $9000 in rent relief. According to county staff it will go to the landlord who evicted her.

Northeast announced that it has partnered with the state Department of Environmental Protection to cover the annual cost of operating and maintaining the mine drainage treatment plant once the plant is complete.

The foot of the bridge lands near the mine portal.

Northeast President Mike John credited the work of all those who’ve paved the way for this project to become reality. “A lot of folks have worked on this project and a lot of good work has happened” he said. “It’s a group effort. We’re proud to be a part of it.”

He credited the state State Department of Environmental Protection and DEP’s Abandoned Mine Lands office along with the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service and WVU which helped get people to the table to move the project forward.

“The real celebration will come not just when the project’s up and running but when the water’s clean again” John said. “We’re excited about being part of it but we’re more excited about life being restored to the Deckers Creek watershed.”

Asked what inspired Northeast’s involvement John said “A big part of what our company’s about is we’re from here and our employees live here.” And they enjoy recreation on the creek. “They’re passionate about trying to help clean up Deckers Creek.” They gave the incentive and propelled the idea forward.

Right now a bridge is under construction spanning the creek from W.Va. 7 in Richard – just outside Morgantown – to a spot near the mine portal where the mine drains into the creek. The bridge will provide access to the treatment plant.

The bridge is tentatively scheduled to be complete by June 10 DEP told The Dominion Post. The awarded bid amount was $998118.21 with the funds coming from coal industry fees paid to the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Abandoned Mine Lands fund. Construction of the treatment facility is scheduled to begin in October and treatment operations are projected to begin in 2022.

The treatment system will use high calcium hydrated lime which will be added to the acid mine drainage within the facility DEP said. After mixing the metals will separate from the water in clarifiers. The clean water then will be discharged back into Deckers Creek.

DEP was unable to provide updated cost projections for plant construction in time for this report but had previously told The Dominion Post it would fall in the $2.5 million to $3.5 million range.

John said the annual operations and maintenance cost will be about $200000 to $250000.

As previously reported NRCS is partnering with DEP for the treatment plant project. Paving the way was a $3.375 million NRCS allotment provided in 2017 — not a grant but a type of fund administered through agreements with other government entities.

NRCS is providing funds for everything related to construction except the land purchase. DEP bought 7 acres around the discharge site for $1.1 million to allow for construction.

Deckers Creek is about 24.6 miles long. The defunct Richard Mine is the single largest source of acid mine drainage into the creek: 200 gallons per minute.

Each year that contaminated flow puts into the creek 730500 pounds of acidity 140000 pounds of iron 59000 pounds of aluminum and 3200 pounds of manganese and renders the last 5.3 miles of the creek – from the village of Richard to its mouth at the Monongahela River – essentially dead.

All involved believe cleaning the last leg of the creek will not only restore life to it but will also boost recreation the local economy and the general quality of life in the area.

Meanwhile the last year's lockdown probably saw you ordering more takeout and delivery than ever. Unfortunately these two trends conflict in a way you might want to know about. With pizza as the most-ordered food this past year advocates are calling out America's biggest pizza brand for inhumane treatment of the animals that become our food.

Late Friday animal advocacy group The Humane League contacted Eat This Not That! editors with a report that may warrant awareness. In the report entitled ""The Price of a Slice"" the organization states that 200 food companies have willingly committed to a new chicken welfare policy that eliminates the cruelest factory farming practices from their supply chains. Those companies that have committed to good for chickens include well known brands like Chipotle Burger King Popeyes Papa John's Starbucks Subway Denny's and more.

This Is the Best Supermarket in America New Survey Says

While a lot of fast food brands family restaurants and manufacturers like General Mills and Kraft Heinz appear on the list of companies that have committed to kinder chicken welfare the number of pizza chains leaves plenty to be desired. The Humane League says big pizza brands have failed to commit to the same animal welfare supply chain practices. The list of these chains includes Domino's—which is the top-selling pizza in America—along with Pizza Hut Little Caesar's Sbarro Marco's Pizza and many more.

Shown is the Humane League's list of pizza chains they're calling on for better animal welfare practices:

The Humane League says these pizza chains allow inhumane practices in the treatment of chickens in particular. Here's what they detail:

Crowded by the tens of thousands into sheds with no room to move around. Standing in their own waste because their sheds are almost never cleaned during their lifetime. Bred to grow so heavy at such a rapid rate that many can't even stand up. Killed using a brutal system called ""live-shackle slaughter"" leaving half a million chickens boiled alive each year. These pizza restaurants allow this to go on every day. They have refused to ban these practices from their supply chains and they have never released a public statement about their standards for chicken welfare.

We all know that making the healthier more conscious transition to eating less meat products takes sacrifice intention and commitment. But the insights we gain from reports like this might better inform where we want to order from next time the house has a craving for barbecue chicken pizza wings or chicken tenders.

In such a situation the delivery men for any eatery work their hardest in order to make sure that the customers are fed even during trying times. Apart from the current risk of getting infected during the Covid-19 pandemic they also battle adverse weather conditions to deliver the orders. One such picture of a delivery boy dropping off an order in the midst of bad weather has been doing the rounds of the internet.

The photo comes from Kolkata where a city-based pizza delivery boy braved heavy rains earlier this week to serve a customer.

Domino’s Pizza a multinational pizza restaurant chain shared a click of their delivery “food soldier” Shovon Ghosh on their official Twitter handle and appreciated him for the act while fighting all odds. In the photograph Shovon can be seen standing with a parcel in a street while being knee-deep in water amid a heavy downpour on May 12. The West Bengal capital has witnessed heavy rains over the past few days.

A Soldier is never off duty! Ours come in blue and deliver hot fresh & safe meals powering through the rains of Kolkata! We salute the service of our #DominosFoodSoldier Mr Shovon Ghosh who ensured that our stranded customer received their food even in such adverse conditions! pic.twitter.com/0xc6yTvn0S— dominos_india (@dominos_india) May 12 2021

Since being shared the post has gone viral with several likes and retweets but it also sparked a debate. In the comments section the internet can be seen divided over the issue. While many netizens applauded the food delivery person for his dedication towards work several others were not impressed and instead schooled Domino’s for making him work amid such weather conditions. They slammed the company accusing it of “exploitation of labour”.

Of late there have been viral posts depicting how the food delivery people are exploited in such situations and then their act is given the name of bravery.

Since lockdown had been first imposed across the country last year many ready-made meal kits have also gained popularity. People stranded at their homes can self-assemble the kits and whip up a meal.

He has also designed a wealth of gardens throughout Ireland the UK continental Europe China and Africa. Appointed Advocate for the International Year of Plant Health (IYPH)* by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Mr. Gavin spoke to the United Nations ahead of World Bee Day about bees aristocrats and truly getting down to earth.

‘We aren’t just gardening for ourselves but for the whole ecosystem’

UN Belgium Diarmuid Gavin was named Advocate for the International Year of Plant Health by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

“If we don’t have pollinators we won’t have food it’s as simple as that. If we keep pumping phosphates and nitrates into the ground to give higher yields all the time we will wear out the earth’s natural resources. We must look after the whole ecosystem and that really does start with our gardens.

We are not just gardening for ourselves but for the whole ecosystem. The good thing is that people are getting the message local government is getting the message and people are understanding that simple wildflowers are open to bees to collect pollen.

We have to realise that gardening is not a 1950s’ version of housekeeping anymore. It is not about perfect green lawns. The humble dandelion is a brilliant provider of pollen.

Don’t believe the advertisements of the chemical companies don’t believe our lawns have to be almost painted green by shoving chemicals into them. Let’s think ‘what do the insects and bees need?’ and maybe garden in a way that is a little bit untidy to create habitats.

The plundering of distant lands

There is a lot of injustice in gardening and a lot of ‘social horticulture’ is tied up with aristocratic endeavour and the higher orders. It takes a while for that to break down.

The history of British landscape gardens has a long aristocratic tradition dating back to Charles I. It is difficult to detach this aristocratic heritage from the challenges of our current social reality but this is a challenge that we must step up to.

There has been a lot of plundering of distant lands for really beautiful plants which only benefits the big nurseries and seed houses. I think we have to come to terms with all that and bring BLM (Black Lives Matter) into it. After George Floyd (the African-American man murdered by a police officer in 2020) people are bringing equality into every area of life and horticulture doesn’t escape that.

I think it will have a dramatic effect on shows on institutions like the Royal Horticultural Society (the organizer of the Chelsea Flower Show) and I think that dramatic effect is just around the corner.

UN News/Daniel Dickinson George Floyd an African American was killed after being restrained by police in the United States.

We have to think holistically about gardening. I am privileged to go around the world talking to people about gardens and about the right way to look after soil soil health and climate health.

However Westerners who travel can cause a lot of damage. I was in Italy last year and saw hundreds of miles of olive trees that were damaged by the xylella fastidiosa pathogen and it caused havoc to olive oil production. If someone had come back to Ireland with a plant with that fungal disease in it there would have been devastation.

The magic of nature

We are all going through tough times at the moment and escaping into the garden where most gardening work is repetitive – such as weeding watering hoeing and planting – takes your mind off everything else.

Gardening is inherently a hopeful thing and you come away from any activity thinking ‘what will I be doing next year what will it look like this year?’ And it is wonderful.

The satisfaction in seeing new growth new energy new life it’s the magic of nature.

And if we don’t want sterile environments where no bird sings and no trees exist we need to look after any environments that we have around us.

Fisher' sign on Summer Street?,"Tony McManus

Special to Foster's

DOVER - Across the front of the building designated as 17 Summer St. is a good-sized sign: ""Samuel C. Fisher."" He is the third member of the group that invested in the purchase of Ricker's Field in 1868.

At the time of the purchase he was living at what is 19 Summer at the corner of Summer and Locust but that lies outside the area of their purchase and the house itself predates their investment by almost 40 years.

The original residence was built in 1830 by Jabez Dow a local doctor who owned and lived in the home at 30 Silver St. Dow was a founder of the Strafford County Medical Society in 1808 and was the husband of Mary Edna Hill Gray Dow mentioned in previous articles as the pioneering first-ever female owner of a business corporation the Dover Horse Railway. The new home on land owned by Dow on Summer St. was built for Samuel Jabez's son also a doctor and he lived there until 1837 when sadly he was committed to an institution for the insane in Somerville Massachusetts. The property was then sold to a Mr. Horton who was the Episcopal minister and by 1848 it was owned by one Lucius Everett.

That brings us back to Samuel Fisher. Born in Francestown N.H. in 1822 he came to Dover when he was 15 to work in a store owned by an uncle Ira Christie. Five years later he owned his own dry goods shop at one point with two locations one within the central retail area and the other part of The Landing closer to the river. In 1847 he married Mary E. Barnes. Early in the Civil War 1862 they moved to New Bern North Carolina where Samuel eventually owned a store a hotel and a farm-plantation. Mary died in 1863 but Samuel stayed another two years and apparently did extremely well financially. Returning to Dover in 1865 he purchased what had been known as the Dow House at No. 19 and three years later he bought into Ricker's Field.

Over the years that part of Summer Street was further developed except for the lot where the Robbins home was built in the 1950s (No. 41) and the still open space at the corner of Belknap Street. This latter is adjacent to the brick residence built and owned by Daniel Hall one of the three investors. Hall it was who among other noteworthy deeds donated the Lincoln saddle to the Woodman Museum and underwrote the construction of the Civil War monument at the entrance to the Dover Library. Lots were sold and homes were eventually constructed on part of Belknap Street (likely named for Jeremy Belknap former minister at the First Parish Church) Hamilton Street Elm Street and on Fisher Street; chances are good that this was named for Samuel C.

He married a second time to Sarah Christie. She was the daughter of Daniel Christie a successful local attorney and the niece of Ira who had been Samuel's first Dover employer and if the family records are correct she and Samuel would have been related to some degree. They lived at 19 Summer St. Samuel continuing to dabble in real estate and eventually according to some reports he became one of the leading taxpayers in the county. He served in the NH legislature in 1874-75 and from 1875-77 he was a colonel on the staff of Republican Governor Person Colby Cheney in Concord. Although the title was honorary Samuel was thereafter generally known as ""Colonel Fisher."" At some point he served as trustee and director of the Strafford Banks. One of his serious avocations was the breeding and ownership of thoroughbreds and this is likely the explanation for the building which is attached to the main house and which bears the sign with his name - it was on-premises housing for his hobby. Samuel was also known as a friend of the Dover artist William Gookin and provided personal and financial support in Gookin's later years when the latter's eyesight failed. Gookin died in 1873.

Sarah passed away in 1897 and two years later Samuel married again this time to an Emily Bacon who like Samuel had been born in Francestown the daughter of a well-known local jeweler Charles E. Bacon. Fisher at the time was 76. Emily was 32. (In 1863 Bacon was paid $11 for providing 10 badges for the city Police Department.) After ten years of marriage Samuel passed away in 1909 and is buried in Pine Hill. Emily inherited the Summer Street home. In 1916 she married Frederick K. Waite. He was originally from Ohio and following their marriage he was appointed to the rank of captain in the U.S. Sanitary Corp in Washington D.C. during World War I. Returning to Dover they occupied 19 Summer St. but then an odd thing occurred. Number 19 disappeared from the Dover Directories and 144 Locust St. appeared in its place. The Waites continued to live there. Frederick's occupation was listed as ""teacher"" and after 1938 the house is reported to be a ""summer residence"" (maybe a play on words?). Frederick died in 1956 Emily a year later at age 91. They are also buried in Pine Hill. In the 1970s the street address reappeared as 19 Summer.

Going back to the original owner of the Ricker Field John Ricker he was described as a prosperous farmer and part of his income at least came from the City of Dover. In that same 1863 for example he was paid $44 for ""plowing and hauling manure city farm"" and later that year $20.30 in exchange for ""breaking roads labor men and teams."" That's well over $2000 in today's money. This was at a time when the average pay for laborers was $6 a week or around $300 a year. Privates in the Union Army were paid $11 a week. So Ricker may not have attained the financial status of a Samuel C. Fisher but he obviously managed to more than hold his own.

Fisher' sign on Summer Street?,"Tony McManus

Special to Foster's

DOVER - Across the front of the building designated as 17 Summer St. is a good-sized sign: ""Samuel C. Fisher."" He is the third member of the group that invested in the purchase of Ricker's Field in 1868.

At the time of the purchase he was living at what is 19 Summer at the corner of Summer and Locust but that lies outside the area of their purchase and the house itself predates their investment by almost 40 years.

The original residence was built in 1830 by Jabez Dow a local doctor who owned and lived in the home at 30 Silver St. Dow was a founder of the Strafford County Medical Society in 1808 and was the husband of Mary Edna Hill Gray Dow mentioned in previous articles as the pioneering first-ever female owner of a business corporation the Dover Horse Railway. The new home on land owned by Dow on Summer St. was built for Samuel Jabez's son also a doctor and he lived there until 1837 when sadly he was committed to an institution for the insane in Somerville Massachusetts. The property was then sold to a Mr. Horton who was the Episcopal minister and by 1848 it was owned by one Lucius Everett.

That brings us back to Samuel Fisher. Born in Francestown N.H. in 1822 he came to Dover when he was 15 to work in a store owned by an uncle Ira Christie. Five years later he owned his own dry goods shop at one point with two locations one within the central retail area and the other part of The Landing closer to the river. In 1847 he married Mary E. Barnes. Early in the Civil War 1862 they moved to New Bern North Carolina where Samuel eventually owned a store a hotel and a farm-plantation. Mary died in 1863 but Samuel stayed another two years and apparently did extremely well financially. Returning to Dover in 1865 he purchased what had been known as the Dow House at No. 19 and three years later he bought into Ricker's Field.

Over the years that part of Summer Street was further developed except for the lot where the Robbins home was built in the 1950s (No. 41) and the still open space at the corner of Belknap Street. This latter is adjacent to the brick residence built and owned by Daniel Hall one of the three investors. Hall it was who among other noteworthy deeds donated the Lincoln saddle to the Woodman Museum and underwrote the construction of the Civil War monument at the entrance to the Dover Library. Lots were sold and homes were eventually constructed on part of Belknap Street (likely named for Jeremy Belknap former minister at the First Parish Church) Hamilton Street Elm Street and on Fisher Street; chances are good that this was named for Samuel C.

He married a second time to Sarah Christie. She was the daughter of Daniel Christie a successful local attorney and the niece of Ira who had been Samuel's first Dover employer and if the family records are correct she and Samuel would have been related to some degree. They lived at 19 Summer St. Samuel continuing to dabble in real estate and eventually according to some reports he became one of the leading taxpayers in the county. He served in the NH legislature in 1874-75 and from 1875-77 he was a colonel on the staff of Republican Governor Person Colby Cheney in Concord. Although the title was honorary Samuel was thereafter generally known as ""Colonel Fisher."" At some point he served as trustee and director of the Strafford Banks. One of his serious avocations was the breeding and ownership of thoroughbreds and this is likely the explanation for the building which is attached to the main house and which bears the sign with his name - it was on-premises housing for his hobby. Samuel was also known as a friend of the Dover artist William Gookin and provided personal and financial support in Gookin's later years when the latter's eyesight failed. Gookin died in 1873.

Sarah passed away in 1897 and two years later Samuel married again this time to an Emily Bacon who like Samuel had been born in Francestown the daughter of a well-known local jeweler Charles E. Bacon. Fisher at the time was 76. Emily was 32. (In 1863 Bacon was paid $11 for providing 10 badges for the city Police Department.) After ten years of marriage Samuel passed away in 1909 and is buried in Pine Hill. Emily inherited the Summer Street home. In 1916 she married Frederick K. Waite. He was originally from Ohio and following their marriage he was appointed to the rank of captain in the U.S. Sanitary Corp in Washington D.C. during World War I. Returning to Dover they occupied 19 Summer St. but then an odd thing occurred. Number 19 disappeared from the Dover Directories and 144 Locust St. appeared in its place. The Waites continued to live there. Frederick's occupation was listed as ""teacher"" and after 1938 the house is reported to be a ""summer residence"" (maybe a play on words?). Frederick died in 1956 Emily a year later at age 91. They are also buried in Pine Hill. In the 1970s the street address reappeared as 19 Summer.

Going back to the original owner of the Ricker Field John Ricker he was described as a prosperous farmer and part of his income at least came from the City of Dover. In that same 1863 for example he was paid $44 for ""plowing and hauling manure city farm"" and later that year $20.30 in exchange for ""breaking roads labor men and teams."" That's well over $2000 in today's money. This was at a time when the average pay for laborers was $6 a week or around $300 a year. Privates in the Union Army were paid $11 a week. So Ricker may not have attained the financial status of a Samuel C. Fisher but he obviously managed to more than hold his own.

(For the record my votes go to Bird Louis and Brady.)

And when it comes to investing there have also been debates among individual investors and financial advisers about investing in actively managed mutual funds and index funds. Anyone who has read this column over the last 20 years knows my vote goes to index funds.

Ninety percent of our clients’ assets at Capital Wealth Management are diversified across multiple asset classes of both stock and bond index funds.

An actively managed fund is typically run by a fund manager and or a team of managers actively buying and selling stocks in an effort to outperform the fund’s corresponding benchmark index like the S&P 500 which measures the performance of U.S. large company stocks). As a result actively managed funds require more and are more expensive to run.

Unlike actively managed funds index funds are not trying to outperform a particular asset category. They are designed to match the performance of the particular asset category of stocks (i.e. the S&P 500) and bonds (Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index). They do this by simply investing in the same stocks or bonds within a particular asset class.

As a result of these differences in management style index funds tend to have significantly lower expenses than actively managed mutual funds.

Since 2002 S&P Dow Jones Indices has published its S&P Indices Versus Active or SPIVA score card which compares the performance of actively managed mutual funds to their appropriate index benchmarks. The 2020 SPIVA report highlights the performance of actively managed funds and index funds over the last 15 years.

As the accompanying chart shows 87.2% of all actively managed U.S. stock funds were outperformed by the benchmark (or index) during this time. Actively managed US Mid-Cap funds were beaten by their benchmark 81.4% of the time. Actively managed US Small-Cap funds underperformed their index 81.5% of the time. In fact actively managed funds underperformed their corresponding index in all 12 asset categories of stock funds over the last 15 years.

When it comes to investing there are some things investors cannot control. However the one thing that all investors can control is how much they pay in fees. And reducing fees is one of the most reliable ways to increase returns without taking on any additional risk.

One big reason index funds outperform actively managed mutual funds over the long term is that index funds have much lower expenses. The average mutual fund has an annual expense ratio of about 1.4%; index funds have an average annual expense ratio of 0.5%. Vanguards Admiral Index funds have an average expense ratio of just 0.1%. This means an index-fund investor can begin each year with a 1.3% head-start on actively managed funds.

How much of a difference can that make? On an account worth $500000 an investor’s annual cost in the index fund is only $500 compared to $7000 for actively managed funds — a difference of $6500. And you’re paying that extra $6500 a year for what?

For investment performance of an actively managed fund that is about 85% guaranteed to not do as well over the long term as an index fund.

Submitted photo

The city of Seymour plans to officially open downtown’s newest community green space in front of the John Mellencamp mural.

A public dedication will be at 2 p.m. May 25. The space is located at the northwest corner of Second Street and Indianapolis Avenue.

Featuring a fenced-in grassy space with tables and seating the location is the perfect destination for small public gatherings and outdoor dining.

“I have already seen the green space in senior pictures and am excited every time I see someone eating lunch or chatting with friends in the area” Mayor Matt Nicholson said.

The project is the result of a $50000 donation from the Mellencamp family and was a partnership between the city and Seymour Main Street.

Richard Mellencamp John’s father said the family is pleased and proud of the mural painted by Indianapolis artist Pamela Bliss and wanted to help enhance the area even more to attract more investment and tourism in Seymour. It also is a way for the Mellencamps to leave their mark on the community in a tangible way.

“We think this project is a perfect complement to Pamela’s mural. It will also help the city and Main Street’s efforts to beautify downtown and make it a destination” Richard said. “This space will give people a place to meet have lunch and get a photo by the mural.”

Other donations to the project included a $2000 local impact grant from the Duke Energy Foundation and sod from Gary and Adam Myers of Myers Sod Farm in Seymour.

Construction on the green space got underway in October 2020 after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of hiring an outside company to create the park several city departments teamed up to do the work including parks and recreation the department of public works and water pollution control.

Chad Keithley parks operations director served as project manager.

“The new green space is socially valuable to Seymour being within walking distance from all of the downtown businesses” he said. “Being located next to the Mellencamp mural it draws people outside to increase social interactions within the downtown area.”

Bri Roll executive director of Seymour Main Street said the mural has been a huge attraction piece for downtown Seymour and the new green space is a beautiful addition.

“We appreciate the Mellencamp family and the partnership with the city of Seymour in accomplishing a welcoming atmosphere for friends families co-workers and tourists all to enjoy” she said.

A memorial plaque is being included in the green space in honor of the late Larry McDonald who owned This Old Guitar Music Store located in the building on which the Mellencamp mural is painted. The building is owned by Bill Bevers.

McDonald who died Feb. 4 was a promoter and historian of the Seymour music scene and was instrumental in the mural project which was completed in November 2019. He also was a classmate and bandmate of Mellencamp.

Those scheduled to attend the dedication event include Richard Mellencamp Bliss Nicholson Keithley Roll Bevers and members of the McDonald family.

Murphy on the Duesenberg Model J chassis the “Disappearing Top” Convertible Coupe saw production of about 25 examples all with a distinctive convertible top that hid neatly within the smooth rear deck when lowered.

Yet there is a much rarer machine the “Disappearing Top” Torpedo Convertible Coupe which is considered by many to be the utter pinnacle of Murphy’s work on Duesenberg chassis. It combined the standard convertible coupe’s lines with the flowing gracefully tapered deck of a “boattail” speedster often finished in bare aluminum that extended forward through the beltline and down the center of the car’s cowl – providing an extra touch of sparkle in the California sun.

Few Duesenbergs so beautifully combined the marque’s performance ethos with the glamour of a status symbol.

CHASSIS NUMBER 2199

Six examples of the “Disappearing Top” Torpedo Convertible Coupe were produced five on the short wheelbase and a single long-wheelbase example. Body no. 876 used on the car offered here may have been the first as this and body no. 898 used on J-198 / 2221 were both “800-number” bodies indicating they were built on-spec for Duesenberg rather than for individual clients. These two cars featured an early prototype version of the Murphy Disappearing Top which hid under a low leather tonneau rather than a full metal clamshell lid. Further body no. 876 features a single-passenger rumble seat within a unique tail design which rather than forming a clean point as on other examples flares out again at the bottom extends out to the sides and then curves to meet the rear fenders – an important identifying point in the surviving Murphy photos of the car.

This was one of two Torpedo Convertible Coupes delivered without the usual chrome “rub strips” on the rear fenders and most distinctively of all with bare aluminum coachwork. The sides of the body and much of the hood were brush-finished while the top of the rear deck flowing through the caps of the doors and into the “sweep” of the hood was polished to a mirror finish. The stunning result resembled the dazzling Rolls-Royces built for certain Maharajas. Only the fenders and valances were painted a rich dark blue.

According to the records of the late Duesenberg historian Ray Wolff chassis number 2199 was sold new to David Gray of Santa Barbara California. Mr. Gray’s father John had in 1903 made the wise decision to invest $10500 in the fledgling automobile company founded by Henry Ford. In 1919 David Gray sold the family stock back to Mr. Ford for $26 million and lived quite happily for the remainder of his life.

The Gray Duesenberg was sold on in 1933 to William McDuffie of Los Angeles. Later in the 1930s like so many Duesenbergs it was modernized with the addition of skirted JN-style fenders and the smaller 17-inch wheels. In this form it was apparently noticed by Hollywood as it made an appearance on the silver screen in a memorable scene of the film She Had to Eat. The car continued to enjoy the care of a handful of Southern California caretakers through the late 1940s including the Beverly Hills attorney and longtime Motor Trend columnist Robert J. Gottlieb.

In 1951 it was purchased by William Coverdale an early and longtime Auburn Cord Duesenberg Club member from Waynesville Ohio. A member of an old railroad family Mr. Coverdale was an avid Duesenberg enthusiast who regularly hosted the faithful at his farm. This was notably his favorite Model J. By the time of his acquisition it was missing the original engine J-178 which had reportedly been used by the Los Angeles dealer Bob Roberts for parts. Coverdale was able to acquire another original Duesenberg engine J-414 which he installed and which remains under the hood to this day.

With the “boattail” returned to presentable running order in addition to a light cosmetic refurbishment Mr. Coverdale often enjoyed driving it. It appeared at an early ACD Club meeting in Avon Pennsylvania in the mid-1950s and would occasionally reappear at Auburn over the years. It remained a prized possession of its owner until 1985 when he was finally convinced to part with it after 34 years. After being brokered through the hands of Bob Adams and Tom Barrett and briefly owned by the late Rick Carroll the Duesenberg was acquired by the Blackhawk Collection. Following a restoration the car was then presented to the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Club and was certified Category One recognizing that it retains all correct Duesenberg components including the original chassis frame firewall and bodywork.

In 2015 the car was acquired by the proud current owner who submitted it to RM Auto Restoration for a complete concours-quality restoration. Research allowed the remarkable original bare brushed aluminum finish to be carefully restored while surviving Murphy factory and period photographs allowed the original trim altered by prior owners to be faithfully reproduced. RM was able to save the vast majority of the original aluminum sheet metal preserving it at great cost wherever possible – a laborious but highly worthwhile process that is evident in the finished product. The dark blue interior and fenders are as-original.

The result drew much attention and favorable comment upon its debut at the 2019 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance where amidst extraordinarily tough competition it was judged Second in Class. It went on to appear at the 2020 Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance where it achieved Best in Class. These remain the only two appearances of the car wearing its present restoration and thus a world of both club and concours showings remains available to the successful bidder.

Through the years the car has been featured on the cover of the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Club Newsletter (Number 7 2002 misidentified as J-476) and in most of the well-known Duesenberg tomes including Josh B. Malks’s Illustrated Duesenberg Buyer’s Guide (p. 49) J.L. Elbert’s Duesenberg: The Mightiest American Motor Car (p. 49 plate 39) and Fred Roe’s Duesenberg: The Pursuit of Perfection (p. 236 center misidentified as J-476). It is accompanied by copies of photographs taken in Tom Barrett’s possession.

With its unique details and fascinating history this extraordinary Duesenberg is every bit the striking and showstopping machine that it was when delivered to David Gray in 1929. One of only four surviving “Disappearing Top” Torpedo Convertible Coupes remaining intact on their original chassis and the only car still in its original bare aluminum livery it is a truly remarkable automobile – one that stands alone even in the rarefied world of Model J Duesenbergs.

This vehicle will be offered at RM Sotheby’s Amelia Island auction taking place 22 May during the world-renowned Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance. In-person and remote bidding options are available; contact RM Sotheby’s to register to bid.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At first we fear it will be another angry midcentury indictment of free enterprise … but it becomes something else entirely. The unusual near- neorealist picture was filmed on location in a New Hampshire mill town; it is newly restored and hopefully destined for Blu-ray soon.

Directed by Robert Siodmak

We’ve been keeping an eye out for hard-to-see movies for roughly sixty years now and yet it’s great that something special can sneak when we’re not looking. Turner Classic Movies just held its May 2021 TCM Film Festival on television for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. They re-premiered several classic movies but with very little promotion. I had never heard of 1951’s The Whistle at Eaton Falls and I don’t think many other people have either. I DVR’d it only because Spectrum cable’s brief description said it was directed by the very familiar Robert Siodmak. It’s a marvelous find for a fan of postwar movies and it wasn’t even presented with a host introduction.

The movie is something special a real revelation. It’s apparently been MIA almost since it came out. I suppose it must have been syndicated to television because I found it in a 1997 Leonard Maltin … 2.5 stars kids. The original distributor of Eaton Falls let the rights revert back to its producer the famous Louis De Rochemont of the March of Time newsreels and the features The House on 92nd Street Boomerang! and Lost Boundaries just to name three. Later on De Rochemont also produced a couple of genuine 3-Panel Cinerama features a connection that helped make possible the recent restoration of The Whistle at Eaton Falls. I’ll get into that a little below.

Eaton Falls is a surprisingly positive movie about a labor clash. It’s not very violent and it isn’t a gangster movie. The livelihood of an entire New Hampshire town is put in jeopardy because a plastics plant may have to close. The screenplay doesn’t simplify the complexities of labor-management problems and the personal conflicts that arise are entirely credible. Adding to the fresh non-Hollywood approach is a remarkable cast that features several acting favorites early in their careers such as Ernest Borgnine said to be fresh out of the Navy. The beautiful favorite Anne Francis looks like a teenager. De Rochemont also tapped a number of Broadway actors that didn’t have extensive film careers.

“Who will pay their wages? Who will feed their kids?”

Here’s a non- spoiler description of the film through its characters not the storyline. When a shoe factory closes Doubleday Plastics is the only employer left in Eaton Falls. Old man Daniel Doubleday finds that he can’t compete too. He buys new mold machines but the numbers say that he still has to lay off half of his workers. When Doubleday’s wife Helen (silent movie legend Dorothy Gish) ↑ takes charge she hires Brad Adams (Lloyd Bridges) to be the new plant manager even though he’s the president of the labor local: Helen wants to keep the plant running somehow through labor-management cooperation. Brad finds out for himself that he can’t make everyone happy — Doubleday is underbid for a big Navy contract and there seems to be no way to cut costs. When he is forced to shut down the plant for an undisclosed period of time some of Brad’s old union friends turn against him.

Eaton Falls is an excellent early film role for feisty Murray Hamilton (the mayor in Jaws Mr. Robinson in The Graduate). ↑ He’s Brad Adams’ main nemesis an antagonistic union blowhard. Russell Hardie (a general in Fail Safe) plays Dwight Hawkins a manager who wanted the big job; he goes to a competing company and schemes to sabotage Brad with the help of a ‘mole’ he left behind in Doubleday’s front office. Brad’s more faithful colleagues are played by a very young Arthur O’Connell (Picnic The Circus of Dr. Lao) James Westerfield (On the Waterfront Wild River) and Ernest Borgnine. This is the second feature film appearance of the great Borgnine who makes an excellent impression with only a handful of dialogue lines.

Brad Adams’ wife doesn’t realize that her new standard of living hangs by a thread. She’s played by Diana Douglas (of The Indian Fighter) at the time married to Kirk Douglas. Film favorite Doro Merande has a non-comic role while several stage notables make rare film appearances. Lenore Lonergan plays a pro-union firebrand; she was in the original Broadway cast of The Philadelphia Story and is memorable in William Wellman’s Westward the Women (1951). Broadway actress Helen Shields (Liliom) has a small part in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Wrong Man. Anne Seymour had roles in All the King’s Men and Pollyanna.

Musical favorite Carleton Carpenter had just appeared in five MGM pictures in less than a year but was discovered in de Rochemont’s earlier Lost Boundaries. Here he’s an art department guy whose imagination helps find the solution to Doubleday’s problems. Carleton’s girlfriend is played by a very young Anne Francis already something of a veteran at age 20.

Director Robert Siodmak was most noted for the film noir classics The Killers and Criss Cross but he got his start back in Germany with the naturalistic docu-romance People on Sunday. Producer Louis de Rochemont had already shown a proclivity for socially sensitive subject matter and the style of Eaton Falls seems to place Italian neo-realism in a provincial Americana Our Town– like setting. In Eaton Falls everyone knows everybody else’s business. A relaxed narrator guides us through travelogue images of what looks like an ideal community — threatened by economic change. The semi-documentary approach gives us ordinary Americans dealing with day-to-day issues of subsistence. It was filmed almost entirely in real mill towns of New Hampshire: Dover Exeter and Portsmouth. Eaton Falls looks authentic from the sidewalks up.

At first The Whistle at Eaton Falls feels similar to several angry films noir of 1949-1950 with axes to grind about injustice both racial and economic: Try and Get Me! The Lawless and De Rochemont’s own Lost Boundaries. Shows of this kind attracted the attention of ambitious HUAC watchdogs who saw that some directors writers and actors were blacklisted and prevented from working.

The surprise with The Whistle at Eaton Falls is that it is not a tragedy or a cry of protest. With the help of a loyal group of workers Brad surmounts Doubleday’s economic dilemma by gambling on a technical innovation. It isn’t exactly rocket science but it gives Doubleday a penny-shaving edge and saves the livelihood of hundreds of employees. Unlikely as it sounds cooperation keeps Eaton Falls on the map. Even in the musical comedy The Pajama Game the ‘union victory’ is really sort of a one step forward half-a-step back deal.

The Whistle at Eaton Falls does not fall into the pessimistic trap of noirs that wail that ‘the system’ is doomed. It also avoids Hollywood’s fairy tale approach to social issues. Pulling the company out of trouble requires more than good intentions or ‘faith in human nature.’ A smart calculation and some luck come into play as well. There’s no phony Frank Capra wave of populist benevolence — Capra’s key ‘social’ classics really hold the average ‘little people’ in contempt. Eaton Falls doesn’t even think that things can be reconciled even if Brad is too decent to lash out at his enemies.

→ Actor Lloyd Bridges was said to have undergone ‘graylist’ problems for a few years. His excellent work here expressing quiet exasperation and then overwhelming joy would later be echoed by his own son. In Francis Coppola’s Tucker: The Man and His Dream Jeff Bridges seems to be channeling his own father’s acting style from 38 years before. The pessimistic Preston Tucker is defeated in his attempt to start a car company despite making a competitive product. Coppola preaches that the country is a closed shop that stifles real competition. The Whistle at Eaton Falls says some of the same things. It doesn’t pull its punches but it also doesn’t condemn ‘the system’ outright. The reality is that everything changes and one has to be clairvoyant just to keep up. Eaton Falls doesn’t distort the problem in either direction which is why it feels so good. Knowing its ‘social noir’ roots I half expected the hero to end up dead in the gutter.

Some industrial dilemmas must find workable solutions and we’re happy to hear of one. Frankly any workable fix for a major social problem these days seems impossible which a story like this one very welcome.

By 1951 ‘social issue’ films were beginning to fade as audience bait. The political climate turned sour as well. Writing about Cy Endfield author Brian Neve said that a theater owner showing Endfield’s downbeat Try and Get Me! reported viewers walking out convinced they’d seen an ‘anti-American’ movie. I also think that The Whistle at Eaton Falls’ initial release momentum could have been killed by the influence of one negative review: Bosley Crowther’s dismissive put-down in the New York Times from October 11 1951. Crowther’s descriptor terms for Eton Falls include “fuzzy and superficial” an “overheated discourse” and an “illusory deadlock out of melodramatics and sentiment.” Crowther offers faint praise for Siodmak’s direction and the realism of the real New England locations but thinks the film’s argument is simply wrong-headed. Having a ‘new invention’ save the day doesn’t convince him when innovation is one of the few ways that an old-style business can be saved. Crowther slams “the inertia of unemployed people in what is admitted to be a land of general prosperity” and wonders why the townspeople don’t just leave town to find jobs somewhere else. In other words Crowther doesn’t acknowledge that working Americans should care about saving their communities. Eaton Falls’ New York run at the Victoria in Times Square lasted just two weeks.

The Restoration

Where the heck did this mystery film come from? I looked and it’s indeed listed in Andrew Sarris’s American Cinema. Although TCM didn’t even give its premiere a host introduction the pristine print was followed by restoration credits the main name being David Strohmaier. Since I recently talked to Mr. Strohmaier about his present restoration work on the Cinerama feature The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm I asked him for an interview.

Before David Strohmaier made the Cinerama restorations his life’s work he had already clocked a full career as a Hollywood film editor. He made contact with the de Rochemont estate when restoring producer Louis de Rochemont’s Cinemiracle feature Windjammer: The Voyage of the Christian Radich. Although originally released by Columbia ownership of The Whistle at Eaton Falls soon reverted to its independent producer. The de Rochemont heirs wanted to license it to TCM but the only video transfer they had was a poor 16mm telecine. David went to work first accessing some materials donated to a college in New Hampshire. But everything needed was on deposit at the Library of Congress: a duplicate nitrate negative a safety print and an optical track. David Strohmaier remembers that librarian Larry Smith was eager to see the restoration happen as Eaton Falls was a personal favorite.

Shipping the nitrate negative to Fotokem in Burbank was impractical but David found that the safety print was in mostly good shape. Everything was converted to digital files. Reel 5 and part of reel 4 were damaged so those sections were scanned from the nitrate negative back in Washington and re-integrated into the picture. The optical print was scanned and the track cleaned up by a company called Audio Mechanics.

David shared some of the digital work with his associate Tom H. March of Calgary a former Canadian broadcast engineer. The two of them finished the job together. Seen on TCM The Whistle at Eaton Falls looks pristine as if it had been filmed yesterday. I would have to be told where damaged sections have been replaced. David re-composited the original trailer as well using the trailer’s audio track.

One interesting detail from David Strohmaier: in a montage of Eaton Falls family life a baby is prominently shown. David was told that the baby is either Jeff or Beau Bridges and since Beau was born much earlier it looks like baby Jeff wins bragging rights. The IMDB already has movie star baby Jeff appearing months earlier in 1951’s RKO release The Company She Keeps.

Will there be a Blu-ray of The Whistle at Eaton Falls? The AFI states that the disc company Flicker Alley funded the restoration but no disc release has yet been announced. The film will soon be showing online through the AFI Silver Virtual Screening Room in a DC Labor FilmFest.

EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZWJheS1hZHVsdC1pdGVtcy1iYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ebay's new adult item ban makes absolutely zero sense,"Long story short: Ebay recently announced a new policy restricting the sale of ""Adult items"" on its online marketplace.

This policy which was announced via email to sellers who have listed or are currently listing items that fall into the adult category amounts to a ban on most nudes fetishwear sexually explicit films video games and magazines as well as hentai some sex toys and ""other.""

Ebay's reasoning for the change is vague to say the least amounting to a one-sentence explanation in response to the prompt ""Why does eBay have this policy?""

""We want to make adult items available to those who wish to purchase them and can do so legally while preventing those who do not wish to view or purchase these items from easily accessing them.""

As a marketplace Ebay has the right to determine what can or cannot be sold on its domain but that doesn't make the specifics of this adult items ban any less bizarre. Some of the rules have nonsensical exceptions that make almost no sense if the intention is to keep adult items off the site and the rest of them are simply worded incomprehensibly.

For example adult magazines are banned except for Playboy Playgirl Penthouse and Mayfair for reasons the policy does not bother to explain. Nude art and photography is not entirely banned but any listed nude art cannot ""contain sexually suggestive poses or sexual acts"" which seems subjective and liable for uneven enforcement if past cases of which bodies are and are not considered inherently sexual or offensive are taken into account.

There's also a ban on ""modeled clothing that is see-through or very tight and shows human genitalia the anus or the nipple/areola of female breasts"" which raises the question if the clothes themselves are banned from sale or if simply modeling them with a visible butthole or two is grounds for listing removal. It's also now against policy to ship sex toys internationally but pre-approved sellers can hawk them within their country of origin. If anyone knows what Adults Only music sounds like that's banned too.

An Ebay spokesperson told Motherboard that the new policy which goes into effect on June 15 2021 is a safety measure. But the statement provided by the spokesperson just offers some details about what the site will look like once the policy goes into effect.

The consequences for violating this new ban on adult items ranges from de-listing of the specific item to account suspension. Just going on how many loopholes and subjective judgements appear from a first pass on these rules suggests that Ebay will have a fascinating job ahead of them enforcing this. For now if you've been raking in the cash selling custom nipple clamps vintage porn and assless chaps on Ebay you might want to reconsider your choice of marketplace.

Mashable has reached out to Ebay for further clarification on this decision and the apparent grey area cases that the policy-as-written doesn't address.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9mYWJ1bG91cy8xNDk2NDkzNS9kaXktZmFuLXNhdmVzLTgwMC1wb3VuZHMtYmF0aHJvb20tdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24v0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL2ZhYnVsb3VzLzE0OTY0OTM1L2RpeS1mYW4tc2F2ZXMtODAwLXBvdW5kcy1iYXRocm9vbS10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Savvy DIY fan saves £800 by transforming bathroom herself with eBay bargains & YouTube tutorials – and it l...,"SPLASHED IT Savvy DIY fan saves £800 by transforming bathroom herself with eBay bargains & YouTube tutorials – and it looks amazing

SICK and tired of your bathroom but don't want to splash out on pricey renovation costs? Then take your inspiration from this DIY fan who saved themselves a huge £800 by tackling the job themselves.

Electrician Ash Rumsam 32 and his partner Suzanna 36 purchased their home - a 1970s fixer-upper - in Blackburn in 2019 and had plans to renovate the entire house.

12 One DIY fan saved themselves a huge £800 by taking on their bathroom transformation themselves Credit: Jam Press

Of course with such a big job on their hands the cost of all the renovations was never going to come cheap so they decided to turn their hand to budget buys and YouTube tutorials in order to save themselves some cash.

Tackling their dull and dated bathroom blogger Suzanne decided to make it a DIY job despite their ambitious plans to remodel the entire bathroom as they didn't like its original awkward layout.

""We ripped it all out and started designing from a blank canvas"" she told Jam Press with Ash taking on the huge plumbing job himself.

Initially a wet room with no bath the couple wanted to create a bath and shower where the old sink and toilet stood.

""We re-plumbed those to the other side of the room so the room flows much better now"" Suzanne explained.

Ash brushed up on his plumbing knowledge with some guidance from Suzanne's dad and renovation tutorials posted to YouTube - saving the couple a huge one £800 on plumbing alone as they could do it themselves.

He also installed a new toilet a chic shower screen and matching bath panel plus a grey vanity unit and his and hers sinks.

Proving to be quite the handyman Ash even tiled the entire bathroom after following how-to guides online.

Suzanne revealed: ""My husband learnt to tile by watching YouTube videos and with a bit of guidance from my dad but he tiled the whole room himself including the floor and I’m so impressed with the attention to detail.""

Chuffed with his efforts she joked: ""You’d think we’d have had professionals in!”

The couple threw out the bathroom's old-fashioned fixtures and instead brought it to life with sleek and modern designs including matte black taps and bargain finds from eBay including their black radiator (£123 eBay) to match.

Ditching the extremely drab tiling that came with the initial bathroom the couple opted for stylish white brick tiles (£220 Wickes) on the walls and monochrome Victorian patterned tiles (£120 Wickes) on the floor - and the finished result is stunning.

Extra touches included matching vanity mirrors they picked up from eBay (£80) and industrial chic overhead lights (£30 eBay) at the double sink as well as tasselled towels and influencer-approved decor like a vase of white pampas scented candles and a wicker tray.

Suzanne who describes herself as a ""creative by nature"" revealed that all in all the bathroom transformation didn't break the bank and cost the couple £2435 - after their huge saving.

The brains behind its new look she said: ""I designed the room and hubby executed it. We work so well as a team and play to both our strengths. I'm a creative by nature and he's a hands-on guy.

""We are so proud of what we have achieved in this room on our own! I am thrilled with the finish of this room it's magical watching your vision come to life.

""We have had our ups and downs and setbacks as with any project like this but overall we are both thoroughly enjoying the process.""

Savvy and stylish - what's not to love.

‘Sammy Snake’ famously featured in a 2002 episode of the Channel 4 comedy after Peter Kay’s club owner Brian Potter ordered an inflatable for his family fun day – only to discover to his shock that it came from an Amsterdam sex show and featured a ‘20ft cock and balls’.

Attempts to disguise the protuberance to make it kid-friendly inevitably failed…

Now the attraction which Kay’s character called ‘inflatable filth’ is on sale via eBay where it has attracted bids of £5000 so far.

The seller from Durham says he bought it directly from the production company and has stored it in his office for the past seven years and hasn’t hired it out.

He said he thought it was ‘the most famous bouncy castle in the world - and the best’.

The auction closes at 8pm tomorrow.

Here it is in action.

The book entitled Remeberings is expected to be released next on June 1.

Today's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW

Thousands of fans have preordered a ‘signed’ copy of the autobiography with some sellers on ebay offering copies for extortionate sums.

After Sinead revealed she had been using a stamp many retailers pulled the sale of the signed copies.

The Nothing compares 2U singer wrote on Twitter that she used the stamp because she was ‘unwell’.

‘The books which are signed I signed using a signature stamp as I was not in a position to hand write my name ten thousand times which is how many I was asked to sign.’

‘My son was unwell as was I. So I stamped them myself. And it is my signature’ she added.

Sinead also revealed that she was pulling all further promotional events of her tour as she was being dragged back into an unhappy past.

‘This is to announce I have done three weeks promo for my book I am now pulling all further promo because the past is not a happy place for me to be dwelling in’ she said.

‘The present is much more enjoyable and I have to take care of my emotional wellbeing’ she added.

Early this month Sinead O’Connor shared some throwback photos from her childhood ahead of the release of her memoir.

In December the singer announced that she would be releasing her new memoir Rememberings in June.

Promising to be ‘revelatory’ the book will see the legend reflect on her ‘fraught childhood musical triumphs struggles with illness and the enduring power of song’.

The 2021 Share Farmers of the Year are driven professional and high-achieving siblings who benchmark excellence within the industry.

Manoj Kumar and Sumit Kamboj from Hawke's Bay/Wairarapa were named the 2021 New Zealand Share Farmers of the Year Waikato's Christopher Vila became the 2021 New Zealand Dairy Manager of the Year and Ruth Connolly from Waikato was announced the 2021 New Zealand Dairy Trainee of the Year. They shared prizes from a pool worth over $210000.

Share Farmer head judge Jacqui Groves from Westpac said Manoj and Sumit impressed the judges with glowing reports from current and past employers and employees.

""They have amazing relationships with two sets of owners who really believe in them and are following the boys' dream.""

The judges were also impressed with their on-farm presentation which used drone footage from their family farm in Northern India to explain their history and where they are from. ""They literally took us there.""

""We were pretty blown away after meeting them"" said Jacqui. ""They became 'our boys' and they benchmarked excellence.""

The brothers are 50/50 sharemilkers on Andrew and Monika Arbuthnott Geoff Arends and Ester Romp's 285ha 460-cow Eketahuna property.

Both Manoj and Sumit have entered the Awards previously with Sumit placing third in the 2018 Hawke's Bay/Wairarapa Dairy Manager category.

They say entering the Awards programme has created an excellent network within the industry and valuable feedback from judges.

""We overcame the lack of a network by engaging more and more in dairy industry events.""

""The New Zealand dairy farming system is totally different from back home in India and it really appeals to us"" they say.

""It's very rewarding as we can see the improvements we make on-farm and there is a culture unlike any other industry.""

""The boys were simply superb"" says fellow Share Farmer judge John Numan. ""Manoj and Sumit were professional driven and high-achieving farmers. They were very impressive.""

To win the national title and $50000 in prizes Manoj and Sumit demonstrated strengths in leadership health and farm safety business and community engagement. They also won three merit awards: the Federated Farmers Leadership Award Honda Farm Safety Health and Biosecurity Award and the Westpac Business Performance Award.

Fellow Share Farmer judge Guy Michaels from DairyNZ says the brothers demonstrated involvement and leadership in the local community and in the dairy community. ""They have a willingness to work with others to achieve joint goals and advocate on behalf of others"" he said.

An example of this was Manoj and Sumit assisting a family in Wellington who had lost employment due to Covid-19. ""They relocated the family and encouraged them into a role within the dairy industry.""

Listen to Rowena Duncum interview Manoj Kumar and Sumit Kamboj on The Country below:

The judges also noted that the brothers had a strong health and safety culture on-farm. ""They have a long history of recording incidents and actually following through with changes.""

Judge Guy Michaels from DairyNZ noted how strong the brothers were in their community involvement and leadership. ""They have promoted PrimaryITO courses to everyone in their community and have offered up one of their buildings to ensure the training takes place.""

A strong message across the first second and third positions was that there are progression pathways in the industry.

""Sumit and Manoj along with the runners-up and third placegetters realise the importance of being profitable and sustainable.""

""You need to be able to save on a very basic level maximising your income streams and having good cost control"" says Guy.

""The message I often hear is that there aren't any progression pathways it's too hard"" says John Numan. ""But there are.""

""These people are achieving it because they have the right attitude that encourages their employers to promote and back them in their business.""

""There are four things you need to progress and I call it the four A's. Attention to detail ability to save ambition and attitude.

""If you've got those things and the respect of the owner you'll go far.""

The judges also noted a theme across the board this year relating to the strong connections between farm owners employers and staff.

""There's a firm link between farming and the environment. It's a generational change and the message is that change is coming it's normal and accepted.""

""They're discussing environmental matters sustainability and recycling on a daily basis and there's a general understanding of greenhouse gases and environmental biosecurity.""

The New Zealand Dairy Industry Awards are supported by national sponsors DeLaval Ecolab Federated Farmers Fonterra Honda LIC Meridian Energy Ravensdown and Westpac along with industry partner DairyNZ.

The runners-up in the Share Farmer of the Year competition Waikato sharemilkers and equity partners Reuben and Deb Connolly were described by the judges as the epitome of a young sharemilking couple.

""They are very thorough and motivating"" says Jacqui. ""They're a young couple working hard and loving every day of their life with their family.""

The Connollys have been 50/50 sharemilkers and 20% equity partners with John and Fiona Worsnop on Woolly Farm Ltd's 110ha 280-cow Otorohanga property for the past four seasons. They won the LIC Recording and Productivity merit award and over $28000 in prizes.

The judges noted that Reuben and Deb have demonstrated real passion for their cows and breeding. ""They had KPIs of capaciousness fertility udders and environmental footprint"" they said.

Reuben and Deb demonstrated how livestock added value to the business with the multiple use of the herd and the national standard cost scheme and achieved their goal of having a bull accepted into a national sire catalogue.

Central Plateau equity partners Andrea and Blair Muggeridge placed third in the Share Farmer category winning the DairyNZ Human Resources merit award the Meridian Farm Environment merit award and almost $20000 in prizes.

The judges described the Muggeridges as a professional driven couple who had structured future plans for the business.

""Andrea and Blair demonstrated excellent staff retention and worked hard to ensure their team had a variety of tasks through their working week.""

""They've taken many opportunities to upskill themselves as well as keeping a great work-life balance.""

The couple are equity partners with Trevor and Harriet Hamilton on the Golden Springs 285ha Reporoa property milking 1080 cows.

The 2021 Dairy Manager of the Year stood out as an immigrant who has come to New Zealand and has spent the past 13 years in the New Zealand dairy industry learning and accumulating knowledge.

Christopher Vila is a Farm Manager on the JA BE Turnwald Family Trust 103.8ha farm milking 341 cows in Ohaupo. He won just under $22000 in prizes and also won the DeLaval Livestock Management merit award.

Dairy Manager Head Judge Malcolm Scott from Westpac says Christopher has built a very strong relationship with his farm owners and his family.

""Christopher is the first person the family has employed that is not a family member. Christopher has earned their trust and respect and is growing with this opportunity.""

""He's on a farm that is like a goldfish bowl surrounded by 50-odd houses and lifestyle blocks"" says fellow judge Gray Beagley from DairyNZ.

""He understands the property is in the public eye and does everything on-farm to the absolute best of his ability.""

""Christopher cares about the neighbouring properties and rather than spray for weeds which risks killing urban plantings he will pull weeds by hand near the boundary fences"" says Gray.

""His attention-to-detail is outstanding and he wants to do everything very well.""

The judges describe Christopher as a humble competent and passionate dairy farmer who sets high standards for himself and staff. ""He's completely engaged in his role but also understands the importance of getting off-farm and spending time with his wife and young daughter.""

powered by Rubicon Project

Christopher has a very good understanding of feed management and of the different feeds that are coming in to the farm.

""Feed is really only used to fill the gaps in the deficit periods"" says Gray. ""He has extremely high animal performance and a high-quality herd.

""Christopher is keeping himself engaged with the new environment regulations that are rolling out and staying completely informed with what is happening there.""

The Dairy Manager judges were impressed by the diverse make-up of the finalists. ""There were Kiwis Argentinians Filipinos male female.""

""Some of these immigrants in the dairy industry are still on work visas and have been waiting for some time to get their residency tidied up. Because of the current government inaction it's been held up and isn't happening"" says Malcolm.

""These people are ready to take the next step in their careers they have contracts ready to sign but can't move forward in their careers because they are still on work visas and are waiting and waiting for their residency to come through.""

""It defies logic.""

The Dairy Manager runner-up Hayden Goodall from Bay of Plenty won the DairyNZ Employee Engagement and NZDIA Power Play merit awards and $11000 in prizes. He is farm manager for Matt Gow on his 215ha Matatā farm.

The judges described Hayden as a young energetic dairy farmer with an urban background who has chosen dairy farming as his career.

""Hayden had a choice – fishing or dairy farming"" says Malcolm. ""He chose dairying and a world of opportunity has opened up for him.""

""He became a little disenchanted at one point however through his connections and networks and strong relationship with a former employer he was promoted and is now fully engaged in the dairy industry.""

The judges noted Hayden's focus on recording and processes were clear monitored and measured. ""It's a living document he's using the data and it's helping them"" says judge Annalize du Plessis from Dipton.

""He also has really good use of a whiteboard where he's engaging the staff and helping them understand the why"" says Gray. ""So you're not just feeding the cows you're feeding them this amount because of this reason.""

The judges also noted Hayden used calculations with his staff helping them to understand area and pasture allocations.

Diego Raul Gomez Salinas from Taranaki placed third and won almost $8000 in prizes and the Ravensdown Feed Management merit award.

Diego is Farm Manager for the Michael D Burr Trust 142ha property milking 380 cows at Stratford.

The judges describe Diego as a passionate likeable and gregarious individual who is quite humble and appreciative of the opportunity New Zealand has given him.

""He oozes passion and enthusiasm for what he is doing.""

The judges noted Diego's strength in pasture management through regular pasture walks constantly monitoring growth rates and paddock performance.

""He covered pasture cultivars and is trying to improve part of the farm that hadn't been regrassed for a long time through the maize rotation"" says Gray.

The 2021 Dairy Trainee of the Year was awarded to Ruth Connolly from Waikato who is described by the judges as a polished and engaging person.

The Dairy Trainee Judges say there was a whisker separating first second and third places and Ruth stood out in the practical and was outstanding in the interview section.

""Ruth is passionate about dairy farming and is constantly pushing for perfection"" says Dairy Trainee head judge Tony Finch from DairyNZ.

Ruth won $9000 in prizes including a Honda XR 190 farm motorbike along with the Federated Farmers Farming Knowledge merit award.

The judges described Ruth as articulate considered and concise with a broad understanding of different industry issues.

""Ruth has a huge love and respect for the cows the land and the people"" says judge Nicky Allomes from Hawke's Bay/Wairarapa. ""She will lead by example and will bring people into the industry.""

Ruth's passion for the dairy industry as well as her work ethic and trustworthiness were noted by the judges.

""She has an insatiable thirst for knowledge which coupled with specific and high-reaching goals will stand her in good stead"" says fellow judge James Courtman.

""Ruth is thankful and blessed to be a New Zealand dairy farmer.""

Ruth is Farm Assistant on the Rukuhia Holdings Ltd 259.6ha property at Ohaupo milking 800 cows.

The judges say all the Dairy Trainee finalists possess a strong appreciation for mental health awareness and a work-life balance and are seeking further knowledge through higher education.

The Dairy Trainee runner-up Dayna Rowe from Bay of Plenty also won the DeLaval Communication & Engagement and Best Video Award presented by Streamliner merit awards together with $5500 in prizes.

Dayna is 2IC on Mike and Viv Joyce's property on their 110ha 370-cow farm in Hawera.

The judges noted that Dayna's personality shone through and she is engaging and passionate.

Dayna demonstrated a high level of pride for the family farm which she works on. ""There is a real level of connectiveness to the farm and its history"" says James.

The judges were impressed by Dayna's interests around the environment the farm and the challenges it brings.

""She is very representative of young people within the industry and will be an excellent leader within the dairy community.

Third placegetter is Mattes Groenendijk from Canterbury/North Otago. He is a farm assistant for Ngai Tahu Farming's 950-cow 303ha Rangiora property and won the DairyNZ Practical Skills merit award.

""He's been able to use his very strong science base to help build a strong farming base"" says Nicky.

""Mattes was detailed in his response and understanding of the environment"" said Tony. ""He is fortunate to be working on a farm that has taken some significant steps to researching the mitigation strategies.""

The judges described him as a confident farmer with excellent general knowledge and an excellent foundation knowledge of environmental issues. He won $3000 in prizes.

Today digital tools have shifted the relationship between work and author in the implementation of artistic strategies. The images that surround us are no longer subject to authorial control but are autonomous byproducts and evidence of our role as communicative participants in contemporary digital society. The online symposium will examine the role of current digital technologies in shaping new forms of authorship and will discuss the capabilities and limitations of this kind of augmented authorship.

In two panels leading artists experts and theorists in the field will discuss methods of digital work in which the role of the author is—partly or entirely—expanded and will examine the capacity of artistic practices to investigate the mechanisms of our fragile digital society.

Hosted by Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts – Lucerne School of Art and Design and HeK (House of Electronic Arts Basel).

The online symposium is public and free and will be held in English as a Zoom webinar from 1:30 to 5:30 CEST. Links to the live event together with the detailed programme and information are available on the website.

Let it happen: accept the image?

The digital tools that we now have at our disposal have come to dominate everyday life in the current media landscape and have shifted the relationship between work and author in the implementation of artistic strategies. The lockdown following the COVID-19 pandemic made this all the more evident: the many images that surround us every day seem to pop up in our communication feeds without any involvement on the part of the author; they are no longer subject to authorial control they seem to be autonomous byproducts and at the same time evidence of our role as communicative participants bound up as we are—and this includes artists—in the media-dominated mechanisms of contemporary society.

But the climate of social and technological development in which we live can actually help artists find new strategies of authorship as they examine their own attitudes towards the self-empowerment of image-making and the intentionality of their images. As agents integral to our digital society and the current crisis artists are inextricably tied up with the images and iterations of images they produce so they need to rethink their practices and positions. The critically reflective deployment of new technologies is also helpful in the context of critical visual studies where the parameters of pictorial concepts of perception can be made visible and comprehensible whether they stem from the natural sciences from the art world or from everyday life.

Expanding concepts of production to the point where the work if not self-generating can be created or at least co-created by other entities will establish new positions as we negotiate prevailing structures—images art society—and their limitations.

Concepts of digital participation generate new work—and vice versa

How does all this give rise to new definitions of authorship? What are the new capabilities and the new limitations of this kind of augmented authorship? How do these new artistic strategies differ from other analogous conceptual positions and artistic practices?

The digital technologies used in the creation of such works provide some guidance on how to find nuanced answers to these questions. From our communication feeds and the structures of our social media platforms through data accumulation and blockchain technology to program-controlled design artificial intelligence and machine learning today’s artists—besides virtual forms of spatial expression such as VR and AR—have at their disposal an ever-expanding range of technologies that can be developed for and applied to new forms of empowered connected and critical authorship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L2VsZWN0cm9uaWMtYXJ0cy10ZXRyaXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Electronic Arts Tetris,"As launch day buyers of Nintendo’s original 1989 Game Boys we’re on record as being long-time fans of Tetris the Russian block-dropping game that helped to spark a portable gaming revolution and created an entire genre of similar puzzle titles. We’ve also enjoyed many of the game’s official sequels and semi-sequels particularly the excellent titles Bombliss and Tetrisphere but none of them have stopped us from going back and enjoying the game that started it all. Now the iPod has its own version of Tetris ($5) and there’s somewhat good news for newcomers to the series. [Updated July 23 2008: We have added a new section to this September 25 2006 review with information on the iPhone/iPod touch version of Tetris as well as updated rating information. Please see the end of this review for the new details.]

Advertisements

Developer Electronic Arts has given Tetris a sweeping audiovisual overhaul. Strong blue menus and cool translucent overlays make the interface attractive while the in-game art – famously rendered entirely usable on the Game Boy’s black and white screen – is detailed and colorful with vibrant blocks and clean backdrops.

The 10 by 20 block well is clearly illustrated block-by-block for strategic block placement while the blocks have highlighted edges that look ever-so-slightly three-dimensional. EA has also remixed the classic Tetris music adding a more modern techno air to the the old Russian soundtrack though you can no longer select from several songs at the start – a sad omission given the game’s musical roots and the iPod’s.

Advertisements

The only bad news here is like Pac-Man in the controls. Rather than trying to emulate a joystick or joypad with two buttons – the default way to play Tetris since its inception – EA lets you move left and right by sweeping your finger in a rotary fashion on the Click Wheel and rotates blocks with clicks on the Click Wheel’s left and right sides. Down drops the block instantly to the bottom while the Center action button moves the block downwards at a pace faster than gravity but slower than the down button. In a phrase this control scheme is sub-optimal – rotating with buttons and moving left and right with a rotary controller really doesn’t make sense – and begs for user-selectable control schemes. For no good reason this default control scheme takes time to get used to and still doesn’t really feel right once you’ve spent time with it though we found it more tolerable overall than with Pac-Man.

Advertisements

In our view Tetris is a gimme of a game title for virtually any system particularly when it’s been blessed with improved graphics and music but on the iPod its great looks and sounds are undercut by an unnecessarily mediocre control scheme.

If you’re willing to adjust the way you’ve played Tetris before – something we wouldn’t do – you’ll get more enjoyment out of this title than we did.

iPhone/iPod touch Version

Out of all the revised Click Wheel iPod Games we’ve tried on the iPhone Electronic Arts’ Tetris is definitely the best. Unlike Scrabble and Sudoku which the company ported with little thought or attention to the iPhone platform Tetris has received a huge overhaul from the original iPod game. The Tetris well is now bigger more detailed and more colorfully framed than before with cool little touches of animation during level-to-level transitions; similarly the music is better more upbeat and interestingly composed. We miss the original Nintendo Game Boy Tetris’s user-selectable music—a hint of the best old tune appears in a nicely animated introduction to EA’s iPhone version—but what’s here is actually quite good.

Advertisements

The big news here however isn’t audiovisual; it’s the gameplay. EA should really have considered christening this title with a new name like Tetris Touch as it’s a few steps beyond the original game in terms of interactivity. You can play the classic block-dropping game as everyone knows it or you can enter Magic mode where a collection of new touchscreen-friendly powers have been added to the game: one transforms the whole board into bubblewrap to let you pop problematic blocks another lets you draw the block of your choice to replace whatever’s currently dropping another lets you shake the iPhone to eliminate empty spaces and still another drops wrecking balls around to crush whatever you shake them into touching.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L2VsZWN0cm9uaWMtYXJ0cy1zcG9yZS1vcmlnaW5z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Electronic Arts Spore Origins,"Amongst computer gamers in particular Will Wright’s Spore is one of the year’s most anticipated releases — a grand scale simulation of evolution enabling you to create and improve a living being as it progresses from a single cell to a creature a member of a tribe a leader of a civilization and eventually a space colonizer. Electronic Arts’ Spore Origins for Click Wheel iPods ($5) is in essence a stripped-down version of the first fifth of the full Spore game initially placing you in control of a single-celled organism then letting you control its progress to a multi-cellular creature with organic eyes weapons and defenses. Updated September 8 2008: Spore Origins has now been released for the iPhone and iPod touch ($10); we’ve added pictures and additional details below along with a separate rating.

Spore Origins for Click Wheel iPods

Origins takes place from a 2-D overhead perspective in water beginning with a fairly clear and open pool progressing through icy and murky waters and concluding on the edge of a beach with nearby sand. We’ve heard the formula described best as “Pac-Man without walls” and think this is fairly accurate: you continue to pilot your creature around through 18 open-edged stages collecting enough dot-shaped DNA balls to let you progress to the next level while enemies alternate between floating around and chasing you. All of your control is handled through touching the Click Wheel which is used to keep you constantly swimming and rotating in the water save for the eventual addition of a special ability—electricity—that’s triggered with the press of the center Action button.

Advertisements

Gameplay is simple: avoid touching creatures who are bigger than you pop bubbles to find more DNA and eat creatures that are smaller than you. You can also find tiny symbiotic dots that rotate around your character temporarily adding speed shields or the ability to poison nearby enemies. DNA is used during a creature editor phase available after every three stages providing you with simple tools to customize the length girth color pattern and mutations of your spore. Depending on your preferences you can add spikes mouths more perceptive eyes scales and other abilities to keep yourself safe and gathering up DNA.

Advertisements

At the end of the game Spore Origins gives you the DNA code for your character enabling you to add it to EA’s Sporepedia.

Coinciding with the display of the creature editor the background art changes every three stages representing a transition between bodies of water; stage-specific enemies and simple objectives are occasionally identified by the game to keep things interesting. Sometimes you’ll be shown a creature that’s deadly if touched under one condition but capable of being eaten if touched in a different situation; at other times you’ll have no real agenda other than finding more DNA. Throughout the stages EA’s creature and stage artwork is actually quite good with colorful characters of various sizes multi-layered backgrounds and neat if simple special effects.

Advertisements

Thanks to some smart aesthetic and play mechanic choices Spore Origins is as close to zen-like gaming as the Click Wheel iPod has ever come. There’s a mode called Aquarium that lets you just listen to music as the spore swims through the water with other creatures and an unlockable survival mode that gives you one-screen food-gathering challenges as you’re confronted by patterns of enemy attackers. Whether you’re playing these modes or the main game of evolution you’ll find that you’re actually drawn into the art and the music as well as the simple and easy to master gameplay. The only hard stage is the last of the 18 and then mostly because it’s not entirely clear how to fulfill the stated objective. Otherwise the game is both relaxing and fun.

Advertisements

EA’s only major flaws in Spore Origins are two in number. First the game’s just too short; a decent player can blow through the 18 stages in three or four hours of dedicated gameplay and the only incentive to keep playing at that point is to create additional characters or try the demo-like alternate modes. This is the major reason for the game’s good but not great overall rating; with more stages and things to do this would have been one of the very best Click Wheel iPod games out there.

Advertisements

Second the title as released by EA crashes before fully loading on the iPod classic and experiences some similar issues on the fifth-generation iPod all apparently related to Apple’s video-out settings on these devices. However we played through the entire game on a third-generation iPod nano without any issues and Apple has pulled the game from the iTunes Store pending bug fixes. Our rating is based on the game as played on the nano; we’ll revise it downward if Apple and EA don’t get the title fixed quickly for users of the other iPod models. It goes without saying that it’s a shame that Spore Origins was released with such serious bugs but it’s also no surprise given the huge number of problems users are experiencing with other iPod and iPhone software these days.

Advertisements

While we weren’t thrilled with Spore Origins’ longevity—especially after the ‘look for other Spore games coming soon to a planet near you’ suggestion at the end—the quality of its aesthetics and the relaxing interesting gameplay both make better than average use of the Click Wheel iPod platform; EA has done a good job of making a limited version of Spore fun and compelling for as long as the stages last. We’re looking forward to seeing how Spore Origins looks on the iPhone and iPod touch; hopefully iPod classic and 5G iPod owners will be able to get in on the action as well. Note: EA re-released Spore Origins with bugfixes for the other iPods.

Spore Origins for iPhone and iPod touch

Spore Origins for the iPhone and iPod touch is in a phrase a more drawn out version of the Click Wheel iPod title with better graphics. The essential gameplay is identical to that of the previously released title and the majority of the levels are extremely similar; not surprisingly the background art and characters have both received upgrades and there’s now some introductory video in the title as well. Surprisingly the game’s not more fun on the touchscreen devices; it’s actually a bit less enjoyable because of the control scheme which depends upon imprecise accelerometer movements rather than the steering wheel-like controls of the Click Wheel iPods. EA tries to modulate this by letting you set the device’s orientation to something other than its default but we didn’t have a ton of luck making this work entirely as we’d wanted.

To its credit EA has tried to do a few things to use the touchscreen devices more impressively than the older iPods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L2VsZWN0cm9uaWMtYXJ0cy1uZWVkLWZvci1zcGVlZC11bmRlcmNvdmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Electronic Arts Need For Speed Undercover,"As racing game fans it’s hard for us to either really love or really dislike Electronic Arts’ new Need For Speed Undercover ($10) for the iPod touch and iPhone. On one hand EA has come up with a title that makes impressive use of these devices’ audio and visual capabilities delivering a generally smooth 3-D car racing experience with highly detailed vehicles and streamlined controls. But on the other hand though the gameplay wouldn’t be laughed off of a rival handheld device it’s missing the special spark that distinguishes truly great games from merely fine to good ones and doesn’t have a multiplayer mode. As such Need For Speed Undercover will be of greatest interest to car and graphics fans who are willing to spend a premium price to see what their Apple devices can do with polygonal vehicle and city models but will underwhelm others.

Advertisements

Though titles such as Namco’s Ridge Racer were achieving equally or more impressive feats on game consoles 15 years ago it’s obvious that Electronic Arts pushed the iPhone to its edges during the Need For Speed development process. The game has a full Fast and Furious-like story complete with missions that place you in real licensed cars that can be purchased upgraded and stolen plus fully filmed introduction and cut scene movies featuring professional actors and an angsty rock soundtrack that plays during the levels. This all may be familiar enough to Sony PlayStation Portable gamers but everything here has polish and obvious quality that distinguishes Need For Speed Undercover from the $2 and $5 racing titles that are far more common these days in the App Store. Between the cars the music and the levels EA seems to have used its extended development time to show just what a $10 game on this platform should look sound and feel like.

Advertisements

Need For Speed’s greatest strength is its visuals.

A tutorial mode teases you with a ride in a Porsche GT2—unlockable later—before you get dumped into your choice of far more humble rides such that in-game characters soon wax on about the comparative greatness of second- and third-stage locked cars such as the Pontiac Solstice and Ford Mustang. Yet regardless of where they may fall in the automotive spectrum EA’s graphics engine renders the 20 cars beautifully and an in-game garage lets you customize everything from their colors and decals to their spoilers body kits acceleration characteristics and handling. To keep you from getting bored by your starter Mazda Nissan or Pontiac Firebird missions soon shift you temporarily into stolen cars for one-off deliveries to chop shops a nice idea that’s undercut only by the very similar handling characteristics of the cars you’re transporting.

Advertisements

Like the cars Need For Speed Undercover’s metro-styled city stages are impressive: from the buildings in the background to objects and other cars on the roads EA hasn’t cut any major corners in delivering tracks that are visually interesting. Though you’ll often see backdrops repeating as you move from mission to mission the presence of variable elements such as swooping police helicopters surging police cars oncoming and perpendicular traffic all work to keep your eyes focused on what’s different rather than what’s similar. Need For Speed divides the game into three different “sectors” of eight missions and each sector has its own art that varies somewhat or entirely between missions; the themes all have an L.A. urban and semi-gritty suburban look. Due to the camera design which tilts your perspective based on the way you’re holding the iPhone or iPod it always feels like you’re getting a fresh view of the action though a pinch to zoom in and out feature doesn’t make much of a visual difference.

Advertisements

Where the game suffers somewhat is in intensity though EA has obviously tried to do as much as it can with the current iPhone OS platform.

Every mission has you steer your car by tilting your iPhone or iPod to the left and right drift with a speed penalty by rapidly jerking the device to one side during a turn and nitro boost with a quick swipe up on the screen. Swiping down activates a brief slow-mo mode and since the game auto-accelerates and constantly pushes you forwards touching the screen activates your brakes. While each of these control elements is actually useful at some strategic point and there’s a definite need to upgrade your vehicle to keep making progress—both a contrast with racers that never require you to brake or just expect you to keep the nitro running to win a race—there’s just something missing here that keeps Need For Speed from feeling like a full-fledged console or PSP-worthy racer.

Advertisements

We’d point to the action which from the modest point bonuses for dangerous driving to the structure of levels feels like a very toned-down version of EA’s vaunted Burnout series. Missions vary from familiar “first to the checkpoint” to “outrun the police” to “take down this rival car” in theme with occasional multi-lap eliminator races that feel like marathons. Unlike Burnout which makes takedowns energetic and fun Need For Speed’s are too often slow and labored with extended chases that are less about cool high-speed collisions than wearing down the long lifebars of individual vehicles. The intrinsic excitement of a police chase complete with wailing sirens and low-flying helicopters is too often rendered boring by the need to merely evade these vehicles for a specified stretch of road rather than being able to cause any real pyrotechnics. It feels like Need For Speed is pulling its punches and if we had to guess why we’d suspect that the game’s less than completely smooth frame rate during multi-vehicle scenes is showing that the current-generation devices can’t handle too many high-polygon cars background graphics and intense speeds at the same time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L2VsZWN0cm9uaWMtYXJ0cy1tYWRkZW4tbmZsLTEx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Electronic Arts Madden NFL 11,"When we covered last week’s release of NFL 2011 by Gameloft we decided to hold off on reaching any final conclusions or issuing a rating until Electronic Arts published Madden NFL 11 — the 800-pound gorilla of American football video games. Now that both companies have their games in the App Store we’re reviewing them together here though you can save yourself the read with one sentence: Madden’s better particularly on the iPhone 4 but more expensive. Read on for the details.

Backstory

Last year’s release of Madden NFL 10 took place a month after Gameloft debuted NFL 2010 its effort to stake an early claim to iPhone and iPod touch football fans. Following Gameloft’s now standard playbook NFL 2010 arrived at an $8 price tag and drew everything from its audiovisual presentation to its gameplay from recent handheld games on competing devices getting enough right in the process to merit a flat B rating. As soon as Madden showed up in the App Store with superior graphics controls and color commentary Gameloft dropped its price and has since sold at a discount relative to EA’s title. An iPad-specific version of NFL 2010 was released in April quickly withdrawn from the App Store due to bugs and then re-released to a generally mediocre reception from players.

Findings from the secondary analysis were presented today during a Late Breaking Science Session at the American College of Cardiology’s 70th Annual Scientific Session and simultaneously published online in JAMA Cardiology.

In the study patients who achieved the highest levels of EPA had similar rates of major adverse cardiovascular events as patients taking a corn oil placebo. EPA was measured 12 months after patients began taking 4 grams daily of a prescription-grade omega-3 product.

“Our analysis shows no evidence that a high EPA level produces cardiovascular benefit” said Steven Nissen M.D. Chief Academic Officer of the Heart Vascular and Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic and the study’s lead author. “Previous studies have found that for those with very high triglycerides fish oil supplements or icosapent ethyl help in lowering them. However based on the current evidence there is no reduction in overall cardiovascular risk for patients.”

In the STRENGTH trial 13078 patients were randomized to receive daily supplementation with high dose omega-3 fatty acids or placebo (corn oil). The high dose omega-3 fatty acid drug used in the study – not available over the counter – did not result in a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events compared to corn oil. The trial was stopped early since there was no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome.

A prior clinical trial published in 2018 found that use of icosapent ethyl a highly purified formulation of EPA significantly reduced cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death among high-risk patients compared to a mineral oil placebo. However according to STRENGTH’s authors the study was controversial because mineral oil had unfavorable effects on cholesterol and markers of inflammation which may have exaggerated the apparent benefit of icosapent ethyl.

The secondary analysis of the STRENGTH trial examined a subset of 10382 patients with available omega-3 fatty acid levels with 5175 receiving omega-3 carboxylic acid and 5207 receiving the corn oil placebo. Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 11.1% of patients treated with fish oil and 11% of patients in the placebo group. Overall this group of patients was 62.5 years old on average one-third were women and another third had diabetes.

Researchers grouped patients into thirds based on how much EPA and DHA was in their blood at baseline and again a year later. They found no difference in major adverse events among patients in the top third of EPA and DHA levels at one year compared with those treated with corn oil. Sensitivity analyses were also performed on changes in EPA and DHA plasma levels red blood cell EPA and DHA levels and primary and secondary prevention subgroups. Again no treatment effects were found.

The study’s authors add that both the original trial and the secondary analysis found that administration of omega-3 fatty acids have risks.

“There was an increase in new onset atrial fibrillation which occurred in 2.2% of patients in the fish oil group compared with 1.3% of those taking corn oil” said Michael Lincoff M.D. vice chair in the department of cardiovascular medicine and director of C5Research at Cleveland Clinic and STRENGTH’s second author.

The original STRENGTH trial was funded by AstraZeneca. Dr. Nissen has served as a consultant for many pharmaceutical companies and has overseen clinical trials for Amgen AstraZeneca Cerenis Eli Lilly Novartis Novo Nordisk The Medicines Company Orexigen Takeda and Pfizer. However he does not accept honoraria consulting fees or other compensation from commercial entities. Dr. Lincoff has received research funding from Amgen Astra Zeneca CSL Behring Esperion Eli Lilly and Novartis and has served as a consultant for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.

The trial was coordinated by the Cleveland Clinic Coordinating Center for Clinical Research (C5Research).

Backorders and complaints over low supply started moderating in the second week of May the drugmaker said after it began ramping up production of the antiviral drug last month.

Hospitals have faced shortages of the drug which is being widely used and was sold in April for over 10 times its listed price in the black market.

Cipla's production of remdesivir is currently 5 times higher than the monthly output of 200000 to 300000 vials seen in the last wave of the pandemic last year the company's Chief Financial Officer Kedar Upadhye told Reuters. Remdesivir was originally developed by U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc.

Future supply of the drug will also depend on the course of the pandemic in India but ""manufacturing is no longer the bottleneck"" Upadhye said.

The number of complaints about supply has dropped Upadhye said adding that Cipla was working with state governments to tackle ongoing supply shortages in parts of the country.

Cipla one of India's oldest drug manufacturers has a deal to make and supply remdesivir to more than 100 countries. Several other Indian drug producers have similar agreements.

The company has also signed licensing agreements with U.S. companies Merck and Eli Lilly to make and sell Merck's experimental COVID-19 drug molnupiravir and Lilly's arthritis drug baricitinib which is also being used to treat COVID-19 in India.

On Friday Cipla reported a 68.1% jump in fourth-quarter consolidated net profit and a 6.6% rise in sales.

Ethan “Freckles” Schneider touts himself as a “Central Park yogi” and “extreme minimalist” who lives on the streets and attempts to leave every place he goes “a little bit cleaner than when I found it.”

The 29-year-old Missouri native — who is known to camp out on West 74th Street and Columbus Avenue and surrounding streets — carries most of his worldly possessions on a modified mountain bike with an electric wheel complete with mini plastic porta potty.

“My mobile command station is comprised of several man-powered carts and wagons as well as three electric vehicles that were salvaged and awaiting repair. I use this collection of vehicles to contain transport and secure various projects that I’m working on” Schneider told The Post.

His Instagram story includes quotes by Ralph Waldo Emerson (“To be great is to be understood”) and Charles Darwin (“It is not the strongest or the most intelligent to survive but those who can best manage change”).

He says he’s not a poseur: “I’m a yogi and live a yogic lifestyle but I’m not much of a yoga instructor and I’m not certified.”

Schneider said his goal is to “promote health discourage disease” and live a lifestyle “that produces zero noise zero air pollution zero water pollution and zero waste.

“In order to live a minimalist life and create less pollution it’s important to live in an environment that does not require lots of material possessions” Schneider said.

But some Upper West Siders charge Schneider is a “neighborhood nuisance” whose behavior has made a few residents uncomfortable. One woman on the Facebook group claimed Schneider stole her son’s blue wagon because he has been seen with a wagon that looks like her son’s. “It was chained overnight on bike parking pole and he stole it. My son saw it when we were biking on Columbus and said ‘mommy it’s our wagon’ and it definitely was. All the scratches and tinted front wheel definitely hours (sic)” the mom posted.

Schneider flatly denied those allegations claiming he knew nothing of any stolen blue wagon. When The Post visited Schneider April 14 he did have a wagon fitting that description.

“The fact that all of you have come together in this group to bully homeless people is just absurd” posted one Schneider defender to the UWS Facebook page adding “He has done absolutely nothing to infringe on your life or your freedom.”

“Mostly the conflict is that I’m young athletic and intelligent and they are old fat and stupid” snarked Schneider.

Judi Sisco an outspoken Upper West Side activist for years said “I have no problem with the homeless. Ethan is not on the street because he’s homeless. … He’s a nuisance. There are people who need safety and help. That’s not him. He thinks he’s a visionary. He thinks he’s saving the neighborhood.”

Sisco said Schneider was sleeping in front of the Unitarian universalist church on 76th Street off Central Park West during the pandemic “and he slowly expanded. Nobody on the street cared until he started expanding his belongings down the street and became uncomfortably familiar with people giving him food and talking to him.”

“If the Upper West Siders would like to legislate the sidewalk than they are welcome to attempt at their own peril and to their own detriment” Schneider warned.

A spokesman for the Department of Social Services-Department of Homeless Services said they “were aware of” the situation and “a multi-agency effort to address” it.

Railed Schneider: “DHS has been attempting to move me around and ultimately bring me into their socialist fold for years now. … They continue to work on the behalf of whoever complains about me rather than work in alignment with my interests and desires.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

He bought it.

Wiggins as president of Wiggin Properties LLC and manager of its affiliated 14000 QSP LP paid $21564158 for Quail Springs Parkway Plaza an anchor of the office sector in northwest Oklahoma City.

The nearly 300000-square-foot complex of two connected six-story office buildings is on 15.5 acres at 14000 Quail Springs Parkway. Quail Springs Office Park is north of Memorial Road/Kilpatrick Turnpike between May and Portland avenues.

The seller was Quail Springs Office LLC which had owned the property for 22 years. It sold for about $1 million less than it did in 1999; then it fetched $22.5 million county records show.

Craig Tucker office specialist and managing broker of Price Edwards Co. represented the seller. The buildings constructed in 1986 and 1988 were nearly 90% leased at the time of sale with the recent signing of an 84000-square-foot lease negotiated by Tucker and Tom Fields of Price Edwards.

Wiggin considered the purchase something of a bargain.

“Office space is not currently a preferred asset class in part due to the expectation of soft demand and challenges renewing leases in the environment of a pandemic. Chuck Wiggin

“Office space is not currently a preferred asset class in part due to the expectation of soft demand and challenges renewing leases in the environment of a pandemic. This has resulted in fewer competing offers that drive up a property’s price” he said. “We take a long-term view and are confident that our strong office management organization our staff’s experience and our proprietary tools will deliver healthy returns to our investors.”

The property with 298610 rentable square feet includes an underground parking garage a two-story lobby and a sky bridge connecting the towers.

“Quail Springs Parkway Plaza presented us an exceptional opportunity to acquire a uniquely high quality asset with the expectation of above-market cash flow returns"" Wiggin said.

Quail Springs Parkway Plaza was the first major office project in Quail Springs Office Park also called Quail Springs Corporate Park a 125-acre master planned commercial development. The corporate neighborhood includes offices for Costco the FBI AT&T AAA EOG Resources Gulfport Exploration and other high profile office users.

Major tenants include Haskell Allstate Insurance Cheyenne Petroleum and Liberty Mutual Insurance.

It was the second addition to Wiggin Properties’ investment portfolio in the past six months. Wiggin bought M.D. Medical Building in Midwest City in November.

Its underpinnings are actually used in the Mercedes-Benz Citan and in the near future they will be re-used as the basis for the upcoming T-Class which in turn will spawn an all-electric version called the EQT.

The EQT was recently shown in concept form but the press release confirmed that it just previewed a series model that would be shown in the near future. It will be a smaller alternative to the EQV a more compact commercial vehicle-based EV designed to carry passengers with no tailpipe emissions.

Taking one look at the EQT concept it’s pretty clear that the front fascia will change a lot for production. The basic shape of the faux grille and the headlights will remain the same but they will be toned down and adapted to make them feasible for a series model. The rest of the exterior though will be basically unchanged as you can see in this believable rendering by ElectricVehicleWeb from India.

And the same goes for the interior. The EQT concept’s interior is clearly the production vehicle’s interior complete with climate controls borrowed from Renaults giving away this car’s French van roots.

What we don’t know about the EQT at the moment is how big its battery pack will be and what kind of range we can expect from it. Renault does currently sell BEV version of the Kangoo called the Kangoo E-Tech but that has quite a small battery pack (recently increased from 33 kWh to 44 kWh) and a WLTP range rating of 265 km (165 miles).

It’s not clear where Mercedes will sell the EQT either. The larger EQV isn’t available in the United States and there’s a chance the EQT will also be a Europe-only affair. However it will still be an attractive buy for taxi companies and families looking for the most room available in an EV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZ3RzcGlyaXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvbWVyY2VkZXMtYmVuei1lcXQtY29uY2VwdC1hLWZ1bGwtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmFuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercedes-Benz EQT Concept: A Full Electric Minivan,"Mercedes-Benz Vans officially premiered the new EQT concept for their small van segment. The T-Class is a full electric vehicle with upto 7-seats and a spacious luggage compartment.

The concept EQT features balanced proportions and sensual surface designs. The black front panel with LED headlights on the bonnet gleams with a star pattern. The star patterns are different in sizes with 3D effect and have been used on the front panel on the 21 inch alloy wheels finished in high-sheen the panoramic roof and electric longboard in the rear.

In addition a lightstrip that connects the LED headlamp to the LED rear lamp is also available this in combination with the high-gloss paint work creates a contrast for the car that results in high-quality aesthetic.

The interior of the EQT concept is finished in an elegant Black and White contrast the seats are covered in white nappa leather with the centre seat panel consisting of recycled leather. The upper section is shaped like a wing profile with a seashore pebble appearance and blends together with the instrument cluster.

Furthermore round air-vents finished in gloss black galvanized trim elements a multifunctional steering wheel and the lighting on the centre console doors and foot well emphasizes the high-quality of the vehicle and its modern appearance.

The Mercedes MBUX infotainment system can be operated using the free-standing central display with touch function and optionally ‘hey Mercedes’ voice assistant. In addition the MBUX system can also interact with the driver with the help of predictive functions as well as display traffic information and over the air updates.

The EQ tile in the main menu serves as a central point of access to the specific displays and settings including the charging currents departure time energy flow and consumption histogram. The EV-specific navigation services also display charging stations electric ranges charge level weather and traffic situations.

For maximum variability and functionality the T-Class features large sliding doors three child seats foldable third-row seats a panoramic roof and a vertical tailgate and window for a spacious load compartment. A transport box for pets and other leisure equipment is also available.

The Mercedes-Benz S-Class saloon the long-wheelbase version and the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class are already rolling off the production line at Factory 56.

The EQS is integrated into ongoing series production at the site as the first all-electric model.

Numerous measures that enhance environmental protection and resource conservation characterise the factory: as just one example photovoltaic systems on the roof of the hall cover yearly around 30 per cent of the electricity demand. Due to maximum flexibility the assembly of different models and drive types on one line is possible.

The processes and equipment in the production hall of Factory 56 can therefore be precisely adapted to the requirements of the EQS electric model. This becomes clear for example in the ""Fullflex Marriage"" whereby the vehicle body is connected to the drive system. The marriage in Factory 56 consists of several modular stations.

Different powertrain variants can thus be connected to the respective vehicle bodies on the same line. Efficiency in production has also been significantly increased - which is partly due to the high level of digitalisation. EQS production and development follow a new concept: product development and production of Mercedes-Benz are becoming even more digital and smarter.

Efficiency in production has been significantly increased which is partly due to the high level of digitalisation.

Student loans made the single mother of two ineligible for certain affordable housing and a market-rate home was beyond her reach. Then she found the Madison Area Community Land Trust.

The trust helped her purchase a three-bedroom house on the west side of the city. The organization paid $160000 for the home and more for necessary improvements. Then Schreiber bought it from the trust for $135000.

“I wouldn’t have been able to afford a house otherwise” she said.

Community land trusts are a form of social housing where a nonprofit controls the land through a long-term ground lease and sells the home to low- to moderate-income buyers at a discount. Such arrangements often limit the value of the homes on resale to ensure permanent affordability.

The idea of social housing is not new but in recent years it has gained momentum in policy discussions. In fact community land trusts and other shared-equity models were part of several presidential candidates’ platforms during the 2020 election and are being floated as part of federal and local pandemic recovery legislation.

Another social housing model limited-equity co-ops also limit homeowner equity though restrictions on resale tend to end when the mortgage does. In Schreiber’s case if she were to sell her profit could be no more than 25 percent of the increase in the home’s assessed value. She isn’t bothered by that bargain.

“My home will stay affordable for 99 years” she said referring to the ground lease. “There’s a huge need for affordable housing and homeownership in Madison. I like being part of the solution.”

Scaling up these models however is a task riddled with challenges. Funding for land acquisition and construction costs is limited. There is resistance to the idea of limiting homeowners’ gains especially among people of color who have historically been closed out of homeownership. And while politicians have voiced support for the model housing agencies are sometimes reluctant to change their ways.

As Karen Haycox CEO of the New York City chapter of Habitat for Humanity put it: “It takes time to turn an ocean freighter around.”

High hopes despite history

When the Houston Community Land Trust launched in 2018 the founders were mindful of how it would be perceived.

“We did not want the negative stigma that goes along with multifamily” said Ashley Allen executive director of the nonprofit. As a result it has focused on single-family homes hoping to change the perception of what affordable housing can be. Eventually the land trust which has 35 homes but expects to have 400 by 2023 will include multifamily properties she said.

Though land trusts and limited-equity co-ops are popularly referred to as social housing they don’t quite live up to the classification. The land trust model does not realize the socialist view of housing as a human right: People still need to pay for it. Certain versions of limited-equity co-ops have a sunset date at which point they turn market-rate.

Fully decommodifying housing in the U.S. would require a societal reprogramming. Even getting community members and elected officials comfortable with the concept of land trusts — curbing home appreciation the primary way families build wealth — is not easy. And other versions of social housing have a lackluster track record.

Public housing the oldest form of housing subsidy in the U.S. has been plagued by decades of disinvestment and crime. Limited equity co-ops started as affordable housing for union workers and took off in the 1950s 60s and 70s fueled by federal housing programs and urban renewal funds. In New York this took the form of Housing Development Fund Corporation and Mitchell-Lama co-ops which restrict the incomes of buyers and resale prices though the latter allows owners to opt out after 20 years.

According to the National Co-op Research Project as of the end of 2016 there were only 166608 shared-equity co-ops in the U.S. more than half of which were in New York. The model fell out of favor as funding dried up and some co-ops were mismanaged. However like land trusts limited equity co-ops have seen a resurgence of interest in recent years.

Community land trusts began during the Civil Rights movement as a way to create economic opportunity for Black farmers. The first in the U.S. was formed in 1969 as a 6000-acre farm collective in Lee County Georgia. Half a century later they remain rare — somewhere north of 225 nationwide according to the Grounded Solutions Network. The average one has 50 units. Their impact on housing affordability in America statistically at least is essentially zero.

Allen said criticism of the restrictions on equity building usually comes from those who don’t need a land trust to become a homeowner.

“Those are people who can afford to ride the market” she said.

Olivia Williams executive director of the Madison Area Community Land Trust has experienced pushback from elected officials based on concerns that land trusts don’t improve Black homeowners’ ability to build substantial wealth. She counters that land trust homeowners build more equity than renters do.

Rosalind Greenstein an urban planning and policy expert at Tufts University said the concern should be contemplated but not used to discredit the model.

“The CLT model says you have a right to housing” she said “not a real estate windfall.”

Challenges in scaling

Amanda Rhein was hired in 2018 to reboot the Atlanta Land Trust. The nonprofit was launched in 2009 but struggled as the recession decimated the city’s community development corporations — another type of nonprofit that has access to community block grants and often partners with land trusts.

The Atlanta trust is now citywide but focuses on southwest neighborhoods along the beltline where the city is seeing the most gentrification she said. It acquires properties through the Metro Atlanta Land Bank donations public entities and by purchasing single-family homes scattered throughout the city.

Even in cases where the land trust is gifted property construction costs can be a major hurdle.

“We really are just one of a plethora of solutions that need to be implemented in concert to address affordability in Atlanta” Rhein said.

Because land trusts limit home values they typically cannot outbid the private market for property. Instead they depend on donated or government-owned properties. Some land trusts have contemplated adding properties subject to tax lien sales or reaching out to homeowners facing foreclosure. A number have successfully done so but Rhein said it is relatively rare.

Land trusts have to tread lightly: To swoop in and buy from distressed owners can sow distrust and identifying those meeting the land trust’s requirements is difficult.

Organizations rely heavily on foundation funds and grants and except for some Fannie Mae options private-sector financing is largely limited to portfolio loans.

The land trust in Madison Williams said has been “understaffed and under-resourced almost our whole existence.” It no longer does buyer-initiated deals which is how Schreiber found her home. City officials prefer that the land trust first select the property and then the buyer to prevent its homeowners from being so scattered.

Williams said although there has been rhetorical support for the model she said she believes City Council members and others generally don’t understand how land trusts work.

“They are not looking at our budget” she said. “I think there is an idea that these other affordable housing developers are self-sufficient so why can’t you be? Just figure it out.”

Beyond housing

Not all land trusts only do housing. In Mississippi Cooperation Jackson purchased government- and private-owned property in the West Jackson neighborhood with a community center as its focal point. It plans to transform these properties into housing cooperatives and commercial buildings. The guiding principle is putting “control in the hands of a community to decide what it wants to develop on its collective land.”

James DeFilippis a professor at Rutgers University’s School of Planning and Public Policy co-authored a paper in 2017 that criticized the direction of land trusts arguing that they have come to be seen as an affordable-housing tool when in fact their core mission is to put control of a community’s development in the hands of its residents. He said he has seen some focus shift back to that.

DeFilippis co-founded the Western Queens Community Land Trust in 2019. The organization is negotiating to acquire a building owned by New York City’s Department of Education in Long Island City. The land trust aims to use the property — part of the site where Amazon once planned a new headquarters — for affordable manufacturing space a commissary a food co-op artists’ studios and other uses.

“That kind of bottom-tier manufactured space is very quickly gentrified away” he said.

New York has a handful of other fledgling land trusts including the East Harlem El Barrio Community Land Trust which received $13 million in city funding in March to acquire and renovate its first four buildings. Modeled on the city’s oldest land trust Cooper Square it will have 36 rental units and three commercial spaces.

The city’s 2020 budget included $850000 to help grow a network of community land trusts and Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged enough city land for 3000 units under the model. These are fractional amounts in the context of a $90 billion budget and the mayor’s goal of creating or preserving 300000 affordable units but they were cheered by advocates as promising gains.

Habitat for Humanity just completed a 56-unit co-op in Williamsbridge for low- to moderate-income buyers as the first project under the city’s Open Door program a limited-equity model for condos and co-ops that restrict resales for 40 years. Habitat’s Haycox sees the combination of these co-ops with land trusts as well as the conversions of rentals to limited-equity homeownership as natural next steps for her organization.

In addition to long-term government commitments to fund shared-equity models Keren Horn a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts–Boston said changes to existing affordable housing programs could pave the way for shared-equity models of housing to grow. She suggested making Section 8 housing vouchers an entitlement rather than award them by lottery which could serve as a stepping stone to land trusts.

Given social housing’s history in the U.S. and the obstacles it faces it is far from certain that the conversation now underway will turn into meaningful gains on the ground. But Greenstein said the pandemic has underscored the urgency of figuring out ways to address housing needs.

“Getting social housing models or getting people to accept social housing as part of government actions has always been a struggle” she said. “I think there is more understanding across sectors that we need to house people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL25ld3lvcmt5aW1ieS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS9zZW5pb3Itc3VwcG9ydGl2ZS1ob3VzaW5nLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtYXQtMTYwLWhhbHN0ZWFkLXN0cmVldC1pbi1lYXN0LW9yYW5nZS1uZXctamVyc2V5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senior Supportive Housing Development Breaks Ground at 160 Halsted Street in East Orange New Jersey,"Construction has broken ground on a 60-unit affordable housing building for senior and disabled residents at 160 Halsted Street in East Orange New Jersey. Designed by DMR Architects and developed by Genesis Companies the building will comprise 61000 square feet with 60 individual units.

The mix of units will include 52 one-bedrooms and eight two-bedroom floorplans. As an income-restricted property the residences will be reserved for individuals and household in very low low and moderate income groups. Genesis has also confirmed that 25 percent of available residences will be set aside for the local homeless population in need of permanent supportive housing.

Additional members of the development team include East Orange Housing Authority and The Metro Company.

“The need for quality affordable senior retail residences is urgent across the state of New Jersey and public-private partnerships like this one provide a framework for future developments” said Karim Hutson founder and managing partner at Genesis Companies. “As real estate developers we are pivotal in creating solutions that meet the needs of our communities and we’re proud to be advancing developments across the region that provide housing for those with the greatest need.”

Financing for the project was originated by Citibank Bank of America the National Equity Fund LIHTC Equity the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and a Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable Housing Program grant.

The building is expected to open next summer.

But if you want to add some fashion kudos into your laidback looks look no further than Diana Princess Of Wales' cool 1990s sweatshirts.

You can now get your hands on an almost-identical version of the late royal's iconic 'USA' jumper – which she was photographed wearing on a trip to her gym at the Chelsea Harbour Club in April 1997.

The slouchy white classic-fit garment emblazoned with the American flag is available to buy for £22.93 on Etsy.

It is described on the site as a ""sturdy and warm sweatshirt"" designed to keep you cosy on chillier summer days thanks to ""air-jet spun yarn"".

Those who have already purchased the item appear very pleased with their deliveries.

One revealed that she was ""obsessed"" with the oversized style while a second shopper praised the quality and ""loved"" how comfy it was.

Diana who passed away aged 36 in August 1997 was frequently snapped arriving at her exercise sessions wearing one of an array of branded sweatshirts.

As well as the 'USA' option Etsy also have in stock another sweatshirt that has gone on to become even more famous.

Diana's navy 'Fly Virgin Atlantic' jumper is also available to order for £23.50.

The original – which was a gift from Sir Richard Branson – sold for £42700 at auction in 2019.

It was emblazoned with the airline’s retro 'Flying Lady' logo which was first inspired by Peruvian painter Alberto Vargas’ sketches of pin-up girls in the 1930s.

The mother of Prince William and Prince Harry would repeatedly arrive at the gym wearing the garment as a sneaky way to stop the paparazzi getting new pictures of her.

Shortly before her tragic death the princess gave the sweatshirt to her personal trainer and longtime friend Jenni Rivett.

She wrote a touching note alongside the present which read: ""Dearest Jenni lots of love from Diana x"".

The sweatshirts have been much celebrated by the fashion world over the years including by Hailey Bieber for Vogue Paris in 2019.

As demonstrated by the model the royal would often finish off her look with now very on-trend gold hoop earrings cycling shorts and chunky trainers.

Locals may recognize Ally Bird Vintage from appearing at local flea markets and pop-ups such as the Artist + Makers Market in Jersey City or through her Instagram account. Now however Hudson County residents can shop Ally Bird Vintage in-person and all year round. On November 1st Alessandra opened her first brick and mortar location inside 6th Street Vintage on 408 6th Street in Hoboken. Read on to learn more about Hoboken’s latest vintage store Ally Bird Vintage.

The Journey to Ally Bird Vintage

Jersey City resident Alessandra Canario Started her vintage Instagram account around 2012 to showcase and share her vintage outfits. Her Instagram handle @allybirdvintage came from her own name. Her last name Canario is the Spanish word for Canary hence ‘Ally Bird.’

“It all started as more of a blog” Alessandra explains. “I was a freshman in college when I started doing Etsy. I started doing flea markets on the weekends as well. When I finished college I joined the Brookly flea” and it grew from there Alessandra explains.

Growing up Alessandra used to love going to yard sales and antique shops with her parents. “I thought I wanted to be a fashion designer as a kid. Growing up I would tell people I wanted to be the next Betsey Johnson “Alessandra laughs.

“As I got older however I became increasingly worried by the environment and troubled by the whole concept of fashion and this idea of ‘nowness’ and what is fashionable and is not fashionable. It was just so far from what I actually believed in so I used to thrift. I became obsessed with history and preservation. Thrifting became a game of just trying to find the oldest thing I could find “she explains.

Once she became old enough to work Alessandra got her first job at a vintage store in Montclair and eventually began working at Another Man’s Treasure in Jersey City which is how she ultimately ended up in Hudson County. Fast forward to 2020 Alessandra finally opens her first physical store in Hoboken on November 1st.

Alessandra’s favorite historical eras for fashion are the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the ‘50s as well as the end of the ‘60s and the beginning of the ‘70s. “The silhouettes are quite similar. I’m constantly mixing those two up.”

Prices of items in the store range from $5 for jewelry and trinkets to $200 for more special items of clothing. Alessandra also often creates handmade and repurposed items that she sells either on her Etsy in flea markets and occasionally at her shop.

What Is an Anniversary Reception? An anniversary reception is a party held on a married couple's wedding anniversary in lieu of a traditional reception on their actual wedding day. This gives couples the opportunity to creatively celebrate their would-have-been-wedding at a later date.

Etsy has also seen a significant increase in searches for “anniversary cake toppers” and “paper arrangements/décor”—a nod to the classic first-anniversary gift. If you’re seeking insight on the dos and don'ts of the reception 2.0 trend read on for more intel as Johnson and wedding planner Jamie Chang detail how to plan an anniversary reception.

Meet the Expert Dayna Isom Johnson is a trend expert at e-commerce brand Etsy. She also served as a judge on NBC's Emmy-nominated series Making It.

Jamie Chang is a San Francisco-based destination wedding planning guru and ‘designer of joy’ at Mango Muse Events. She has been creating personal and meaningful wedding experiences all across the world for over a decade.

Anniversary Reception Etiquette

1. Is an anniversary reception right for you?

“One of the big questions couples have about an anniversary reception is whether they should have one at all” Chang says. Some couples worry that having an anniversary reception is selfish or that asking guests to celebrate perhaps for a second time is unnecessary. It’s important to remember though that after a year where so many celebrations were put on hold it’s likely that your guests will look forward to the chance to gather see others and most importantly celebrate your union!

2. Who throws an anniversary reception?

Any couple who had to downsize their wedding elope or have a virtual wedding will likely be considering an anniversary reception. Chang shares that in many cases the couple will host the reception since it is technically an anniversary celebration but parents may also be involved as this could be considered an opportunity to throw the wedding for their children that they didn't get a chance to.

3. When do you throw an anniversary reception?

Typically an anniversary celebration would take place one year maybe two after the original wedding date. However in the “new normal” the anniversary reception doesn't necessarily have to be on the exact anniversary.

4. Who gets invited to an anniversary reception?

Anyone you would invite to your wedding is who you'd invite to your anniversary reception. Of course just because you're having an anniversary party doesn't mean it has to be huge. Chang advises you should still focus on inviting the people you love and want to celebrate with above all.

5. What will people expect at an anniversary reception?

Your anniversary reception could be very much like a full wedding including the usual expectations from such an event (dinner dancing etc.)—or not. Chang points out that it could be something completely non-traditional where you have a theme or center the event around an activity. Or it may be more of a familiar anniversary party where you share moments from your wedding but also celebrate where you are now.

Johnson says couples looking to creatively weave anniversary symbols into their receptions should consider incorporating paper—it’s not only a unique material choice for decorations like bouquets or centerpieces but is the traditional one-year anniversary gift.

6. Do you need to send formal invitations?

Given that an anniversary reception is very similar to a wedding you will want to send official invitations. These invitations should reflect your style and what's important to you so they don’t have to be as formal as a complete wedding invitation suite but they should include all of the event details and match the style of the party.

7. Should gifts be expected or accepted?

Gifts are a bit of a grey area Chang says particularly because couples who are planning an anniversary reception right now may have already had some type of wedding and received gifts then. Though if you eloped in the truest sense of the word this anniversary celebration is basically your wedding reception and gifts would be an acceptable expectation. As a couple it's important to make a decision and then let guests know whether you decide to share registry details on the event website or request no gifts by word of mouth.

8. Does there need to be a dress code?

This is a time where all bets are off and wherever you land on the spectrum from black-tie to blue jeans is up to you! Either way Chang recommends treating the dress code as you would a wedding as far as letting guests know what is expected and giving them guidelines.

Steps to Planning an Anniversary Reception

1. Conceptualize your vision.

Planning an anniversary reception begins with understanding what your hopes dreams and goals are for the event. Is it essentially the wedding you would have originally planned (or maybe in this case vow renewal)? Or is it something different?

2. Agree on a budget.

In many ways the anniversary reception will be treated similarly to a “normal” wedding in the sense of budget and who pays. Once you’ve decided what kind of event you’ll be having you’ll want to have the financial conversations early and be upfront about who will contribute where.

3. Pick a date.

Chang thinks of the anniversary receptions we’re seeing this year more like sequel weddings stepping in where a ""normal"" celebration couldn't take place. That said there’s no need to get hung up on trying to lock in your actual anniversary date. Pick a date that works for the experience you want and go from there. Maybe it’s your exact anniversary maybe not!

4. Hire a planner.

Once you’ve determined some general concepts and a budget you can work with it's time to bring in a planner to make your vision and ideas concrete. Just like a wedding your planner will formulate a plan to bring those ideas to life ensure a seamless event flow and make sure everyone has a good time.

5. Assemble a team.

The execution of the event will likely require vendors or perhaps some family and friends depending on the scale of the event. Either way Chang says “finding a team to help you execute the experience you're looking to create is critical as every team member brings specific skills and talents that help make your event great.”

6. Decide on the details.

After your team is in place it's time to dial in on the details. These may include the schedule floorplan flow guest communication logistics design details music gifts and maybe a few fun surprises. “These are the pieces that will help ensure an awesome experience and put the cherry on top” Chang says.

7. Decide what to wear.

Ultimately the type of attire you choose is really up to you and the reception you're creating! Just remember to include any details of the dress code on your invitations as well.

8. Enjoy the moment.

Don’t forget to sit back and really enjoy this moment of togetherness. “You've got a team in place to help you execute everything so all you need to do now is have fun celebrate with your loved ones and share these special moments with your partner” Chang says. “Because like with any wedding your anniversary reception celebration will go by fast and you want to savor every moment.”"

An analysis of the fossil fuel company’s documents also found it tried to downplay the dangers of climate change

Exxon Mobil Corp. has used language to systematically shift blame for climate change from fossil fuel companies onto consumers according to a new paper by Harvard University researchers.

The paper published yesterday in the journal One Earth could bolster efforts to hold the oil giant accountable in court for its alleged deception about global warming.

""This is the first computational assessment of how Exxon Mobil has used language in subtle yet systematic ways to shape the way the public talks about and thinks about climate change"" Geoffrey Supran a research fellow at Harvard and co-author of the paper said in an interview with E&E News.

""One of our overall findings is that Exxon Mobil has used rhetoric mimicking the tobacco industry to downplay the reality and seriousness of climate change and to shift responsibility for climate change away from itself and onto consumers"" he added.

A spokesperson for Exxon Mobil disputed the paper calling it part of a coordinated legal campaign against the company.

Supran and co-author Naomi Oreskes a professor of the history of science at Harvard (and Scientific American columnist) conducted a computational analysis of 180 Exxon Mobil documents from 1972 to 2019 including peer-reviewed publications advertorials in The New York Times and internal memos.

Using a series of algorithms the Harvard researchers found that Exxon Mobil had privately relied on some terms while publicly avoiding them altogether.

For example Exxon Mobil's internal documents frequently described climate change as a problem caused by ""fossil fuel combustion."" But in public-facing documents the company referred to global warming as a problem caused by the ""energy demand"" of ""consumers.""

The public communications sought to deflect responsibility for climate change away from the oil giant and onto individual consumers who heat their homes and fill their cars with gas the researchers wrote.

Following their merger in 1999 Exxon and Mobil also increasingly presented climate change as a ""risk"" rather than a reality the analysis found.

This language sought to minimize the dangers of global warming while not denying their existence outright the paper says.

Court battles

The researchers drew a direct comparison between Exxon Mobil and major tobacco companies which they said used similar tactics to shape public discourse about smoking cigarettes.

""These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations — which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms — and onto consumers"" they wrote.

In the 1990s attorneys general from all 50 states sued the largest U.S. tobacco companies over their alleged deception about the harmful health effects of smoking cigarettes and the addictive nature of nicotine. The suits culminated in a $206 billion master settlement agreement (Climatewire March 10).

Since 2017 five states and more than a dozen municipalities have filed similar suits alleging that the biggest U.S. oil and gas companies misled the public about the climate risks of burning fossil fuels. The complaints ask the oil industry to help cover the costs of addressing floods wildfires and other disasters fueled by rising global temperatures.

Supran said that although he didn't conduct the study with the climate liability litigation in mind the findings can nonetheless inform the legal fights.

""Obviously we did this completely independently. I've never spoken to any of the lawyers involved"" Supran said. ""But certainly with hindsight our insights may be relevant especially to these more nascent cases alleging deceptive marketing.""

Last month New York City filed a lawsuit asserting that Exxon Mobil BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC violated the city's consumer protection law by engaging in ""green washing"" or the practice of making their fossil fuel products seem more environmentally friendly than they really are.

Exxon pushback

Asked for comment on the paper Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said in an email to E&E News: ""This research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against Exxon Mobil and other energy companies.""

Norton noted that Oreskes is on retainer with Sher Edling LLP a San Francisco-based law firm that represents a slew of the challengers in the climate liability suits. ""Oreskes did not disclose this blatant conflict of interest"" he said.

Norton also pointed to the paper's partial funding from the Rockefeller family which Exxon has accused of supporting a climate conspiracy against the company (Climatewire May 4).

""The research was paid for by the Rockefeller Family Fund which is helping finance climate change litigation against energy companies"" he said. ""This follows a previous study attacking Exxon Mobil that used a similar discredited methodology.""

Norton was referring to a 2017 paper by Supran and Oreskes in the journal Environmental Research Letters that found Exxon's communications from 1977 to 2014 misled the public about climate science.

Vijay Swarup Exxon's vice president of research and development previously blasted the 2017 paper as ""fundamentally flawed"" in a comment in Environmental Research Letters last year.

Norton concluded by stressing that Exxon supports climate action noting that the oil giant recently proposed a massive carbon capture project in Houston (Energywire April 20).

""Exxon Mobil supports the Paris climate agreement and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies"" he said.

In a joint statement to E&E News Supran and Oreskes pushed back on Norton's allegations.

""Sher Edling played no role in the paper we published today nor in any other academic work we have done. They have not funded any of our studies; they have not reviewed our data or interpretations prior to its peer-reviewed publication; and we have never discussed any of our work concerning ExxonMobil with them. Therefore there is no conflict of interest and nothing to disclose"" the researchers said.

""For context we note that over the past four years ExxonMobil have attacked us and our work"" they added. ""It has become a familiar pattern. We publish science ExxonMobil offers spin and character assassination. ExxonMobil is now misleading the public about its history of misleading the public.""

ATLANTA — 11Alive’s friends at PolitiFact tipped us off to a viral Facebook post about a gas station in East Point charging $7.99 a gallon.

A photo of the receipt posted on Facebook was spreading on social media faster than gasoline sales during the Colonial Pipeline shutdown.

The receipt showed that an East Point gas station was charging $7.99 a gallon for premium.

Some people on social media are commenting that the photo or the receipt was obviously faked. But most believe that what the photo shows is true and they are outraged.

With the picture of a local gas station receipt our Verify team set out to sort out truth from fiction.

THE QUESTION

Could the viral photo of a receipt showing $7.99 for fuel possibly be real?

THE SOURCES

Google

ExxonMobil

Gas station manager M.D. Azim

THE ANSWER

Yes the receipt does show what the gas price at one station showed at least for a period of time. But we've learned there's a bit more to the story.

WHAT WE KNOW

First on the receipt ExxonMobil is misspelled as “ExxonMobile.”

ExxonMobil’s website shows that there is not an “e” at the end of the company’s name.

Next the gas station’s address that is printed on the receipt 3260 Washington Road shows up on Google as the address of a restaurant not a gas station.

We drove to the address and found New Han’s II Chinese Restaurant.

But next door to the restaurant is an Exxon gas station at 3270 Washington Road. The business’s name is “Best 4 Less” which runs the gas station as well as a convenience store.

We didn’t see any gas selling for $7.99 when we checked.

We bought some gas and got a receipt. And our receipt was printed inexplicably with the same misspelled name “ExxonMobile” and the same wrong address -- 3260 Washington Road -- that show up on the receipt that’s posted on social media.

We talked with the manager M.D. Azim who told us that earlier in the week during the pipeline shutdown he did set his price for premium at $7.99 a gallon. But he said it was an accident and that the premium price was supposed to be $4.99 a gallon.

He said he corrected it immediately after he realized it - within an hour.

At the time we talked with him he was not selling any premium gas because he said he had sold out and was waiting for deliveries to resume now that the pipeline is back in service.

Azim said he will give refunds to anyone who brings in their receipt.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9nYXMtc3RhdGlvbi1tYW5hZ2VyLWNvbmZpcm1zLWNoYXJnaW5nLTc5OS1wZXItZ2FsbG9uLXNlZW4tdmlyYWwtcmVjZWlwdC1kZW5pZXMtZ291Z2luZy0xNTkxODcy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gas Station Manager Confirms $7.99 per Gallon Gas Denies Price Gouging,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/gas-station-manager-confirms-charging-799-per-gallon-seen-viral-receipt-denies-gouging-1591872 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9nYXMtc3RhdGlvbi1tYW5hZ2VyLWNvbmZpcm1zLWNoYXJnaW5nLTc5OS1wZXItZ2FsbG9uLXNlZW4tdmlyYWwtcmVjZWlwdC1kZW5pZXMtZ291Z2luZy0xNTkxODcy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9leHhvbi1icmluZ3MtZm9yd2FyZC10aW1lbGluZS1mb3ItcmVwYWlyLW9mLWxpemEtZ2FzLWNvbXByZXNzb3Itc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon brings forward timeline for repair of Liza gas compressor system,"ExxonMobil on Friday announced plans for the safe start-up of the Liza Destiny oil platform’s malfunctioning flash gas compressor system by June following repairs of key components.

“Repairs and upgrades to the third stage discharge silencer a key component of the flash gas compression system for the Liza Destiny are being progressed by MAN Energy Solutions at a facility in Houston Texas. The manufacture of a redesigned [third] stage discharge venturi has been completed and it is being shipped to Guyana” Public and Government Affairs Advisor Janelle Persaud said in a statement yesterday.

Persaud said that the there are plans for the equipment to be shipped back in the country and will be reassembled for safe start-up in June.

Exxon had previously stated that the flash gas compressor would not be repaired until July.

Exxon has increased flaring above pilot levels in order to maintain safe operations due to the malfunctioning of the flash gas compressor system and millions of cubic feet of gas have been flared per day raising numerous environmental and safety concerns. The flaring over the last year and a half would have significantly upped Guyana’s emission of greenhouse gases.

Friday’s statement came a day after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the Environmental Permit for the Liza Phase 1 Project has been modified and ExxonMobil’s subsidiary Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited will now be required to pay for gas flaring once it continues beyond a 14-day period. With the modification there is an obligation on the company to pay for the emission of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) as a result of flaring in excess of timelines at the rate of US$30 per tonne of CO2e.

Meanwhile according to Persaud’s statement ExxonMobil Guyana Production Manager Mike Ryan visited the MAN workshop in Houston this week to meet with the leadership team technical experts and repair personnel and have a firsthand look at the progress of repairs.

Persaud said that operations at the Liza Destiny are continuing safely and producing between 100000 and 110000 barrels of oil per day with a flare level below 15 Thousand Standard Cubic Feet per Day.

“ExxonMobil Guyana remains fully committed to resolving these technical challenges as quickly as possible and remains engaged with relevant government agencies to ensure operations are executed safely taking environmental technical and economic factors into consideration” the statement concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9pbGFuZGdhc21pZGRsZWVhc3QuY29tL2xpc3RzLzM4MzQ5LWNwZWNj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CPECC - EPC Contractors List,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.oilandgasmiddleeast.com/lists/38349-cpecc on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9pbGFuZGdhc21pZGRsZWVhc3QuY29tL2xpc3RzLzM4MzQ5LWNwZWNj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Since Friday FedEx has taken delivery of 100 new Boeing 767 freighters! And deliveries of these jets to the airline are far from over.

There are many large airlines out there that don’t have 100 of any one model in their fleet. And of those that do it’s quite rare to find one whose 100 examples of a model have an average age of only 3.6 years! That is quite an impressive little bit of statistics if you wrap your head around it. And it is literally true for FedEx and its 100 Boeing 767 freighters. It also says something interesting about the maker of those planes too.

The 767 has long evolved into a true cargo workhorse. Passenger versions of the aircraft are undergoing conversion to freighters even today. But more importantly brand new ones are still coming out of Boeing’s factory in Everett as this latest delivery shows. The FedEx Boeing 767 aircraft with number 100 has registration N277FE. It literally has “100” painted-on to mark this milestone for the airline – and Boeing.

Even before reaching 100 planes FedEx surpassed UPS as the largest Boeing 767 operator. UPS were the launch customer for the aircraft. And as the average age of FedEx’s fleet shows they were quite late in the game! Currently UPS have “only” 70 767-300F models with two more on order. However they also have 8 767s that are conversions. The airline will certainly continue as a large operator of the jet for many years to come like their competitors.

FedEx – The First 100 Boeing 767 Freighters

The newest 767s in FedEx’s fleet will replace their oldest Airbus A300-600RFs. But certainly not all of them. Some of those Airbuses are among the last to come out of the factory – and one is THE last! FedEx could decide to upgrade some of these jets like UPS did.

With FedEx expecting 30 more 767s on top of their first 100 and more orders from other operators Boeing aims to keep the 767 production line open until at least 2027. The same line also produces the KC-46 aerial refuelling tanker. And with more orders of those jets likely that production line in Everett could remain busy for even longer.

These orders (and numbers) suggest a ‘homogenization’ tendency in the airline’s fleet. FedEx are the largest cargo airline in the world in terms of overall aircraft numbers. But they have some old jets like their MD-10s. They recently ordered more 777Fs to replace those.

But interestingly the 100 examples of the Boeing 767 in FedEx’s fleet don’t make this their most popular model. That honour still goes to the 757 with 119 examples. And very much unlike their 767s the 757s average the ripe-old age of 29.4! It will be quite interesting to see what they will replace those planes with. According to planespotters.net FedEx has just 9 737 freighters… 8 of which are 737-400s. Too old and frankly not big enough to replace the 757s.

The airline has had some encouraging financial results in the pandemic. So more interesting new orders could be somewhere around the corner..!

(KY3) -Friends and family gathered Saturday morning to celebrate the life of Mercedes Luna a woman killed in a car crash near Rogersville earlier this month.

Loved ones organized a memorial service Saturday in Luna’s memory.

“Mercedes was the type of person you hope and pray your daughter will grow up to be” said youth group leader Justin Hatfield.

”I miss her so much and I’m really really proud of her. I will miss her every day that she’s gone” said sister-in-law Anna Luna.

Mercedes Luna was killed in a vehicle accident while traveling on Highway 125 near Strafford on May 7 2021. Missouri Highway Patrol reports the driver of the dark-colored SUV was trying to pass a FedEx truck in a no-passing zone. Luna coming from the opposite direction swerved to avoid the SUV but hit the FedEx truck.

”She was the most beautiful stubborn kind incredible and determined person I ever met. She was so caring and loving” said Anna Luna.

Mercedes Luna was a student-teacher for the Logan-Rogersville School District. Her family says that she loved children and wanted to be a first-grade teacher.

”Mercedes was the standard. She made you want to be better just by being in the room. She could make you smile by simply smiling. She showed us true selflessness.“ said Hatfield.

”She was my perfect example of what a Christian woman should look like. It was like the more I got to know her the more I got to know God.” said Anna Luna.

Mercedes Luna would have received her bachelor’s degree in teaching from Drury University on Friday. Her husband Joshua Luna accepted her diploma in honor.

”Mercedes was simply a good friend. One of those friends you hope you never lose. She was honest kind and joyous. She was the kind of girl everyone wanted to be friends with. She touched everyone she met and changed lives. I would not be where I am without the encouragement she gave me on a daily basis” said Hatfield “She touched so many lives.”

ATL UTD 2 battled back twice from a one-goal deficit to split the points as Matías Benítez scored his first goal for the club in his debut while Homegrown Tyler Wolff netted a late equalizer for his first professional goal.





ATL UTD 2 dictated the pace early controlling the majority of possession and holding Energy FC without a shot for the initial 35 minutes. Despite Atlanta’s early control it was OKC who found the game’s first goal in the 36th minute. Atlanta failed to clear an Energy FC corner and Villyan Bijev buried the loose ball with a low shot to the bottom right corner.





Atlanta responded early in the second half when Darwin Matheus earned a penalty in the 54th minute. OKC attempted to play a back pass to goalkeeper C.J. Cochran but Matheus intercepted the ball and dribbled into the box where Conor Donovan crashed into him. Benítez took the penalty but Cochran made a diving save to the bottom right corner. However the ball fell right to Benítez who easily tapped in the tying goal.





Energy FC regained the lead in the 65th minute from a set piece. Tucker Stephenson delivered a free kick from the left side into the center of the box and the ball was deflected into the air. Mitchell Osmond finished with an acrobatic leaping kick into the right side of the net.





However ATL UTD 2 again tied the match with just moments remaining. After good work from Benítez down the left side earned Atlanta a corner kick it was played short to Connor Stanley who also made his debut. Stanley played a cross into the box where it was knocked down to an unmarked Wolff standing on the left side of the six-yard box. The Homegrown blasted a half-volley shot into the side-netting for the equalizer in the 89th minute.





Atlanta tried to steal the game-winner in stoppage time when academy forward Coleman Gannon attempted to curl a shot into the top-left corner from just outside the 18-yard box on the right side but it missed just wide of the far post.





ATL UTD 2 (1-1-1 4 points) returns to action for its home opener against FC Tulsa Wednesday May 19 at Fifth Third Bank Stadium (ESPN+ 7:30 p.m. ET).

ATL UTD 2 joined USL for its expansion 2018 season and plays its home matches at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw Georgia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNS8wNS0xNS1wYWRkb2NrYnV6ei1nbXJncNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paddock Buzz: Grosjean Feels Fan Love from Podium,"The crowd gathered around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s victory podium following Saturday’s GMR Grand Prix was cheering wildly for an NTT INDYCAR SERIES driver.

Only in this case the driver wasn’t the race winner; it was the second-place finisher.

Most motorsports fans know where Romain Grosjean was six months ago painfully extricating himself from a burning Formula One car at the Bahrain circuit. It was frightening and it was emotional for all of those who viewed the nearly three-minute ordeal in real time. (It’s even difficult watching the replay knowing the outcome!)

The positive attitude Grosjean has responded with has earned him a legion of supporters and many of them were in the throng yelling his name Saturday.

Yes Grosjean noticed and he certainly appreciated the sentiment. The proof was in the aggressive manner in which he pumped his fist.

“People have been very good to me” he said. “I’m very grateful for all of the support for me and my family.”

Everything about Grosjean’s U.S. experience seems to be going well with a pole and a podium in this event and a top-10 finish in the season-opening race at Barber Motorsports Park. But most of all he is having fun for the first time since 2013 when he scored six F1 podiums for the Lotus team.

“Leading (44) laps” he said of the best part of being in INDYCAR. “I love driving the car. Even in the warm-up this morning (the crew) said you can pit for some changes and I said ‘No I’m not pitting.’ I was just happy to be out there and pushing and learning the car.

“I’m having a great time. The atmosphere between the drivers is excellent. We’re joking and having fun. It is super competitive on the track but as soon as you remove your helmet it’s like good friendship between the drivers which surprisingly you don’t find anywhere else. I love that part.”

Traffic Jam for Grosjean

Asked what he didn’t love about Saturday’s race French driver Grosjean didn’t hesitate.

“Blue flags” he said pausing for effect but still smiling.

Grosjean said he got stuck behind the lapped car of Sebastien Bourdais late in the race preventing him from making up ground on leader and eventual winner Rinus VeeKay. But Grosjean said his friend and countryman was on new alternate (red) tires something he couldn’t overcome with older tires.

INDYCAR’s next race is the 105th Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge with practice beginning Tuesday. Grosjean won’t be driving the No. 51 NURTEC ODT Honda of Dale Coyne Racing with RWR as he is only competing on the road courses and street circuits this season. He said he will watch Pietro Fittipaldi drive the car from his home in Switzerland.

Grosjean: Not Yes or No on ‘500’

One probably shouldn’t read too much into Grosjean’s comments Friday about reconsidering an Indy 500 run in the future. He didn’t say no but he didn’t say yes either.

“Never say never” he said. “We take things step by step. I think for my whole family they were super supportive (regarding joining INDYCAR) but obviously seeing me going back racing I guess was not that easy. They can see how happy I am (here).

“But right now I can’t say yes or no.”

Podium Finish Helps Palou Gain in Standings

Five races into 2021 Alex Palou is still here – within reach of the championship lead that is.

Palou in just his second season and first driving Chip Ganassi Racing’s No. 10 The American Legion Honda is just 13 points behind six-time series champion and teammate Scott Dixon (No. 9 PNC Bank Honda). The 24-year-old Spaniard finished third in Saturday’s race to move into second place heading to the “500.” And he closed on Dixon who finished ninth gaining 13 points.

So far this season Palou has won a race (at Barber Motorsports Park) and finished in the top four of two other races to demonstrate consistency. Remove that frustrating 17th-place finish in St. Petersburg Florida and Palou would be the points leader.

“That’s what happens when you have the best team around you” he said.

Now comes the “500.” Palou will seek to avoid a repeat of last year’s race when he hit the Turn 1 wall on Lap 122. He finished 28th after starting seventh.

“I had a good Month of May going until I crashed” he said. “I’m not going to do that again.”

Wentz Gets First Look at Massive Speedway

New Indianapolis Colts quarterback Carson Wentz apparently had done the math before making his first visit to IMS. When asked about capacity at the iconic motorsports facility Wentz was on the mark.

“Like five (of my) hometowns” he said.

Indeed Bismarck North Dakota where Wentz’s North Carolina family moved to when he was 3 has a listed population of 72777. Venue capacity at IMS is estimated at 350000 which makes five times accurate.

Wentz gave the command to start engines for Saturday’s GMR Grand Prix and hopes to attend the “500.” Of course this year’s race will have attendance capped at 135000 due to COVID-19 precautions.

Wentz met 1969 Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti who has driven the Ruoff Mortgage Fastest Seat in Sports two-seater at INDYCAR races for years and did so again Saturday. Wentz said he likely would accept a ride with Andretti if offered and his schedule allowed.

Another Colt on Hand Too

Colts cornerback Kenny Moore has been a fixture at INDYCAR races this season and this was his third event in four so far with the “500” up next. Moore has become particularly good friends with Pato O’Ward but he also knows Felix Rosenqvist and Alexander Rossi among others.

“They think what I do is crazy” Moore said. “Let’s just break it here: What they do is crazy. It’s just a mutual respect.”

Moore emphasized the adrenaline rush he gets being on pit road when the engines are roaring – “It makes me pumped to put on a helmet again” he said – and hopes teammate Wentz enjoyed it as much as he has.

And for the record Moore rode with Andretti in the Ruoff Mortgage Fastest Seat in Sports at Barber Motorsports Park.

“Loved it” he said.

Road to Indy Finishes Strong

Chicago’s David Malukas of HMD Motorsports held off England’s Toby Sowery of Juncos Racing in a wild final lap of Saturday’s Indy Lights race.

The two cars went side by side in Turn 1 with Sowery drifting into the grass. But he recovered to give two more challenges the last at the finish line where the cars were separated by .0283 of a second. Malukas who started on the pole and led every lap has won the second race of each of the three events this season.

In Indy Pro 2000 Denmark’s Christian Rasmussen of Jay Howard Driver Development won his second race of the weekend and his third in the past four starts in his rookie season. Russia’s Artern Petrov of Exclusive Autosport won Saturday’s first race his first of the season and his third in the series.

Brazil’s Kiko Porto of DEForce Racing won the third and final race of the weekend in the USF2000 Championship. The victory was his first in the series.

Odds and Ends

VeeKay not only became the third first-time winner of 2021 he became the first driver to have won races in all four levels of INDYCAR’s ladder system.

The youth movement is on this season in the NTT INDYCAR SERIES. Four of the five winners this season are younger than 25 (Alex Palou Colton Herta Pato O’Ward and Rinus VeeKay) and they just happen to be the four youngest full-time drivers in the series. Six-time series champion Scott Dixon 40 is the other race winner.

VeeKay said he has an agreement with his trainer that podium finishes earned can be rewarded with his favorite dessert. “Cheesecake” he excitedly said. “And this might have syrup on it.” VeeKay was told he could have an entire cake but he vowed to stick to a single piece.

Graham Rahal had an exceptional fifth-place finish. The driver of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing’s No. 15 Fifth Third Bank Honda got knocked into the first-turn grass on the opening lap and found himself 24th in a 25-car race after pitting twice. His crew insisted he conserve fuel the rest of the race while trying to maintain pace and he did that in finishing fifth. He remained fifth in the standings but he gained seven points on the series leader. He trails by 39 points.

Palou had the best quote of the day pointing out last year he drove the car Grosjean drove Saturday. “I did a really good job of giving him a good car” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMS8wNS8wNS0xNS1HTVJHUC1SZXBvcnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VeeKay Speeds to First Career Win in GMR Grand Prix,"By the Numbers: Race Results | Driver Standings

The belief always has been there for Rinus VeeKay. Now it has translated into victory.

VeeKay earned his first career NTT INDYCAR SERIES victory Saturday in the GMR Grand Prix on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course in his 19th career start. VeeKay drove his No. 21 Sonax/Autogeek Chevrolet to a 4.9510-second victory over NTT P1 Award winner Romain Grosjean in the No. 51 NURTEC ODT Honda.

Alex Palou rounded out the podium finishers in the No. 10 The American Legion Honda.

""I actually thought it yeah” the confident VeeKay said when asked if he believed he could win this 85-lap race. “We had an awesome start to the weekend. I knew we had the car; we were so fast. I'm so happy for the team so thankful. I couldn't have done it without them.

“A perfect day. It's amazing and thank you to all the fans coming out. Getting my first podium here last year and now winning it's a dream.”

VeeKay 20 became the sixth-youngest winner in INDYCAR SERIES history by delivering Ed Carpenter Racing its first victory since Josef Newgarden won in July 2016 at Iowa Speedway. VeeKay also became the first driver ever to win in the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and in all three rungs of the Road to Indy ladder series – Indy Lights Indy Pro 2000 and USF2000.

The victory also continued a remarkable opening five races of the 2021 season with three first-time series winners – VeeKay Palou (Barber Motorsports Park) and Pato O’Ward (Texas 2) – for the first time since 2013. There also has been a different winner in each race this season.

2020 NTT INDYCAR SERIES Rookie of the Year VeeKay led 33 laps and averaged 116.096 mph. He took the lead for good on Lap 65 when six-time series champion Scott Dixon made his final pit stop in the No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda on a different pit strategy than the leaders.

Then VeeKay managed his gap over Grosjean and traffic over the closing 20 laps as very light rain began to spatter the Speedway. The moisture never required a switch to rain tires but it kept VeeKay and the rest of the 25-driver field atop their respective steering wheels.

VeeKay’s margin over Grosjean was 9.0106 seconds with 10 laps to go. Grosjean helped by Firestone alternate “red” tires that were three laps fresher than VeeKay’s sliced that gap nearly in half over the last 10 trips around the 14-turn 2.439-mile circuit but never threatened VeeKay who also slowed in his final laps to save enough fuel to finish.

""I was not concerned about the fuel” VeeKay said. “I just hoped the rain was not going to get worse. I'm standing in Victory Lane!”

This was the first podium finish in open-wheel racing since 2015 at Spa-Francorchamps Belgium with Lotus in Formula One for rookie Grosjean who joined Dale Coyne Racing with RWR this year after 10 seasons in F1.

“That’s really a good day” Grosjean said. “I think we’ve done really good work this weekend. We learned at the start of the race and we were super fast. We were a bit unlucky with the slower cars and traffic but P2 in my third INDYCAR race is not too bad.”

Fans at IMS serenaded Grosjean with cheers as he was interviewed on pit lane after the race. The Frenchman has gained worldwide acclaim and popularity for his positive attitude after suffering severe burns to his hands last November in a fiery crash at Bahrain that ended his F1 career.

“It’s incredible” Grosjean said of the crowd. “Bahrain it was horrible but for my life it’s been a great experience and people really are behind me and I can tell. I can feel it. The support I’m having is incredible. You only see me smiling here in the U.S.”

VeeKay and Grosjean both used the Firestone primary “black” tires for only one stint but their strategies differed. VeeKay started on primaries from the seventh starting position while Grosjean led the field to the green flag on alternates from the pole.

That choice allowed Grosjean to rocket to a lead of more than four seconds over Palou before both made their first stops on Lap 25.

Grosjean who led a race-high 44 laps regained the lead on Lap 28 after the field cycled through its stops. He made his second stop on Lap 43 and switched to the more durable but less grippy primary tires handing the lead to Ryan Hunter-Reay on a different pit strategy in the No. 28 DHL Honda.

VeeKay had made his second stop on Lap 36 with a set of alternate tires. He used the extra grip to pass Grosjean for third in Turn 12 on Lap 44. But it was a decisive move because Hunter-Reay and Dixon were running 1-2 respectively but on a different pit strategy.

Dutchman VeeKay made his final pit stop on Lap 60 taking alternate tires. Grosjean stopped for the last time on Lap 63 also taking alternate tires but VeeKay stayed ahead of him in Turn 1 as Grosjean exited pit lane.

Two-time series champion Newgarden finished fourth in the No. 2 Snap-on Tools Team Penske Chevrolet while Graham Rahal rounded out the top five in the No. 15 Fifth Third Bank Honda.

Dixon kept the championship lead 176-163 over second place Palou. Dixon finished ninth today after starting 16th.

The next NTT INDYCAR SERIES race is the 105th Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge on Sunday May 30. Practice on the 2.5-mile oval opens Tuesday May 18.",,,,,,

The establishment reportedly recycles 100% of end-of-life photovoltaic modules using no chemical substances. The process recovers all the PV’s associated materials – inverters cables optimizers mounting structures etc.

Gerard O’Laoi Gedlec Energy Pty Ltd.’s Managing Director captured and shared some impressive footage of the facility’s machinery in action via social media. Presented in the video were two rollers sandwiching and crushing a solar panel like a paper shredder.

The dilemma of solar power waste casts a dark shadow on the renewable energy industry. Experts caution that solar panels are incredibly challenging to recycle due to the hazardous metals added to the cell’s silicon material to boost their effectiveness.

Lu Fang the China Renewable Energy Society’s Secretary-General stated in 2017 that:

“[…as solar panels typically have a shelf-life of two to three decades the problem with solar panel disposal] will explode with full force in two or three decades and wreck the environment” because it “is a huge amount of waste. They are not easy to recycle.”

Lotus Energy aims to deliver the solution to this problem with its chemical-free recycling method.

As Mr. O’Laoi pointed out in a LinkedIn post:

100% of the materials separated from [the Lotus Energy] process will be reused and given a second life. All inverters rail components the cable can be processed in this facility in Thomastown Vic.

Lotus Energy said in a September 2020 press release:

…[they are] committed to contributing to the circular economy of the renewables industry and are pleased to share no chemicals are used in the process and that all materials recovered i.e. solar modules inverters cables and batteries can be recycled by our facility for alternative use leaving no waste for landfill.

While Lotus Energy is Australia’s first dedicated solar plant recycling facility the country is soon to get another. Reclaim PV Recycling announced in February that it’s developing a plant in Adelaide a suburb of Lonsdale in South Australia.

According to a Reuters report solar panel recycling plants have been with us for a while. Water and waste group Veolia opened the first solar recycling plant in France in 2018.

But regardless of who came first the arrival of all PV recycling facilities and businesses in Australia is graciously welcome. Without them the nation’s world-leading uptake of solar energy threatens to generate a mountain of waste.

The same goes globally – solar cell recycling techniques will form an essential component of renewable energy effort in the coming years.

Based on an Australian National University report renewable power in Australia is growing at a per capita rate 10x faster than the global average meaning it will likely become a testing ground for new solar panel recycling methods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFicWpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzIzOTEyODgvYWdncmVzc2l2ZS1zYWxlLXBpdGNoZXMtY2FzdC1zaGFkb3ctb24tc29sYXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casting a shadow on solar: Aggressive sale pitches target uninformed consumers,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

BEIJING May 15 (Xinhua) -- The lander carrying China's first Mars rover has touched down on the red planet the China National Space Administration (CNSA) confirmed on Saturday morning.

It is the first time China has landed a probe on a planet other than Earth.

""The Mars exploration mission has been a total success"" Zhang Kejian head of the CNSA announced at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center.

After the success was confirmed the control center in Beijing was filled with cheers and applause.

""It's another important milestone for China's space exploration"" he said.

The Tianwen-1 probe touched down at its pre-selected landing area in the southern part of Utopia Planitia a vast plain on the northern hemisphere of Mars at 7:18 a.m. (Beijing Time) the CNSA announced.

It took ground controllers more than an hour to establish the success of the pre-programmed landing. They had to wait for the rover to autonomously unfold its solar panels and antenna to send the signals after landing and there was a time delay of more than 17 minutes due to the 320-million-km distance between Earth and Mars.

Tianwen-1 consisting of an orbiter a lander and a rover was launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the coast of southern China's island province of Hainan on July 23 2020. It was the first step in China's planetary exploration of the solar system with the aim of completing orbiting landing and roving on the red planet in one mission.

The name Tianwen meaning Questions to Heaven comes from a poem written by the ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan (about 340-278 BC). China's first Mars rover is named Zhurong after the god of fire in ancient Chinese mythology which echoes with the Chinese name of the red planet: Huoxing (the planet of fire).

The spacecraft entered the Mars orbit in February after a journey of nearly seven months through space and spent more than two months surveying potential landing sites.

In the early hours of Saturday the spacecraft began to descend from its parking orbit and the entry capsule enclosing the lander and rover separated from the orbiter at about 4 a.m.

After flying for approximately three hours the entry capsule hurtled toward the red planet and entered the Mars atmosphere at an altitude of 125 km initiating the riskiest phase of the whole mission.

First the specially designed aerodynamic shape of the entry capsule decelerated with the friction of the Martian atmosphere. When the velocity of the spacecraft was lowered from 4.8 km per second to about 460 meters per second a huge parachute covering an area of about 200 square meters was unfurled to continue reducing the velocity to less than 100 meters per second.

The parachute and the outer shield of the spacecraft were then jettisoned exposing the lander and rover and the retrorocket on the lander was fired to further slow the speed of the craft to almost zero.

At about 100 meters above the Martian surface the craft hovered to identify obstacles and measured the slopes of the surface. Avoiding the obstacles it selected a relatively flat area and descended slowly touching down safely with its four buffer legs.

The craft's plummet through the Martian atmosphere lasting about nine minutes was extremely complicated with no ground control and had to be performed by the spacecraft autonomously said Geng Yan an official at the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the CNSA.

""Each step had only one chance and the actions were closely linked. If there had been any flaw the landing would have failed"" said Geng.

After separating from the entry capsule the orbiter with a designed lifespan of one Martian year (about 687 days on Earth) was lifted to return to its parking orbit and helped relay communications between the landing vehicle and Earth.

The rover Zhurong will take a further seven to eight days to detect the surrounding environment and conduct self checks before moving down from the lander to the Martian surface according to Geng.

The six-wheeled solar-powered Zhurong rover resembling a blue butterfly and with a mass of 240 kg has an expected lifespan of at least 90 Martian days (about three months on Earth).

China has constructed Asia's largest steerable radio telescope with an antenna 70 meters in diameter in Wuqing District of northern China's Tianjin to receive data from the Mars exploration mission.

""According to the images sent back from the orbiter earlier we've found a large crater with a diameter of about 620 meters close to the landing area of the probe"" said Zhao Shu a senior engineer at the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The camera on the orbiter has taken detailed images at a resolution of about 0.7 meters revealing the pre-selected landing area has complicated terrain with many rocks and more craters than previously expected said Wang Chuang one of the designers of the probe from the China Academy of Space Technology.

""But we believe the design of our probe is capable of landing in and exploring the region"" said Wang.

A nonstop flow of tourists walking the city's historic Embarcadero stop for selfies with the ship (even though most don't know what it is). I watch as I wait to board.

My tour of the 100-foot catamaran is a result of good or bad luck depending on your point of view. The Energy Observer and its 10-person crew are on an unscheduled stop here due to weather on their way from Southern California to Hawaii. The ship has been at sea since 2017 out to prove its technological tools in the harshest possible conditions.

Watch this: Hydrogen solar and wind: How this ship creates its own energy 06:53

""If they can survive here they'll work really well on land."" says Katie Nicolet the ship's scientist. ""The ultimate goal is to showcase that we can use renewable energies to navigate and go around the world"" without any type of emissions.

Without a doubt the most striking feature of the catamaran are its 202 square meters of solar panels covering the majority of its exposed surface. Most of the time they feed the batteries that power everything on board from the engines to the kitchen appliances. ""But on a day like today when we drop anchor we don't have engines (running); we're producing too much energy. So instead of wasting it we're going to turn the excess energy into hydrogen."" says Nicolet.

The Energy Observer is covered in 202 square meters of solar panels. John Kim/CNET

Using reverse osmosis pumped-in seawater is converted to pure water that's then electrolyzed by the onboard batteries. The electrolyzation separates the water molecules into pure oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen is stored in eight tanks on the ship's wings. Nicolet says the tanks can store enough hydrogen to power the ship for six days. When the batteries run low and there's not enough sun the hydrogen is used to create electricity using the same fuel cell found in the Toyota Mirai sedan.

The chemical process the fuel cell uses to create electricity also produces water and heat. The water is collected in tanks and the heat is used to warm the cabin and for hot water.

Second only to the solar panels in terms of unusual features are the sails. Unlike with most sailboats Nicolet says engineers had to design them with a unique factor in mind: shade.

""Otherwise"" she says ""we would have a big mast in the middle and half the ship would always be in the shade."" That's not ideal when you're relying on the sun to keep the lights on. The sails built to minimize shade work more like airplane wings than traditional sails to generate forward momentum. Most of the time the ship is running in a hybrid mode generating about half its power from the engines and half from the wind (though it can run by wind completely with about 15 knots of power).

Though a pilot is always at the helm when the ship is moving the Energy Observer operates mostly autonomously. John Kim/CNET

Below deck you'll find six cabins the lounge area that doubles as the crew's workspace the kitchen and what Nicolet refers to as the brain of the ship. Similar to the display panel on a hybrid or electric car this computer shows the crew everything from how much power they're producing to how much they just drained by making a cup of coffee. ""We have an engineer with us at all times"" Nicolet says. ""And sometimes we have to ask him Can we run the dishwasher? Can we have a hot meal tonight? Or are the batteries too low?""

Energy Observer and its crew next plan to sail to Hawaii before heading to Tokyo to promote hydrogen-based energies at the summer Olympics. See more from my tour of the Energy Observer in the above video."

It's a comprehensive grand plan which is what we need.""

CLEVELAND — There's a new proposal to develop Cleveland's lakefront and it comes from Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam.

While there have been numerous plans and renderings before City Council President Kevin Kelley says he feels this one maybe different.

""The reason this one feels different is that there is private sector buy into this one"" Kelley who is also currently running for mayor told 3News. ""This isn't all just public sector and the fact that the Browns are so committed [is great].""

The proposal organized by Haslam Sports Group and first reported by Cleveland.com calls for a park-like land bridge over State Route 2 and the railroad tracks. The hope is to link the lakefront area around FirstEnergy Stadium Great Lakes Science Center and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of downtown specifically to the mall atop the Huntington Convention Center.

""We've been talking about this bridge for a long time now"" Kelly said. ""Let's get it done.""

Kelley says the plan was put into motion as part of an application for Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC) funding from the Ohio Department of Transportation with the Haslams leading the charge.

""They definitely really wanted to drive this and they've always been committed to developing the area around the stadium"" Kelley added.

Besides the land bridge connector the renderings also reveal development all along the water with buildings plazas terraces a playground and more. The public access is one of the plan's selling components for Kelley.

""How much public space does this add for regular Clevelanders?"" he asked. ""Are we making sure that this is open to the public that people can use this bridge and that there are public spaces down around the stadium? I think if we do that this can really be something that we support.""

The awarding of the TRAC funds wouldn't come until sometime later this summer. Meanwhile Kelley has scheduled a presentation for City Council's Finance Committee on Monday to go over the proposal in more detail. However so far he feels this is about as close as the city has been to making moves along the Lake Erie shoreline.",,,,,,,,,

The Milwaukee Bucks' quest for the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs stayed alive with a 122-108 home win over the Miami Heat on Saturday at Fiserv Forum.

Milwaukee scored 44 first-quarter points to propel itself to a 16-point lead after 12 minutes. The Bucks led by as many as 24 points in the game but Miami stopped the bleeding and cut the deficit to as few as 11 points in the fourth quarter.

However that's as close as the Heat would get as Milwaukee shot 53.5 percent (65 percent at halftime) from the field en route to the 14-point win. Seven Bucks scored in double digits led by Khris Middleton and Bryn Forbes with 21 apiece. Reigning back-to-back NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo pitched in 15 points nine rebounds and four assists.

The Heat were without Jimmy Butler (lower back tightness). Kendrick Nunn stepped up as the team's top scorer tallying a game-high 31 points on 13-of-18 shooting.

The 46-25 Bucks will move from third to second with a road win Sunday over the Chicago Bulls and a Brooklyn Nets home loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The 39-32 Heat who saw their four-game winning streak end fell to sixth in the Eastern Conference.

Bucks F Giannis Antetokounmpo: 15 points 9 rebounds 4 assists

Bucks F Khris Middleton: 21 points 7 rebounds 7 assists

Bucks' Balanced Offense Propels Milwaukee

It was a good day at the office for the Bucks rotation which featured a relentless and balanced attack that elicited no answer from the Heat defense.

Brook Lopez made all but one of his 10 shots. Middleton (8-of-12) was efficient as well.

The onus wasn't on Giannis to do much offensively with his teammates providing more-than-adequate support.

Only one player took more than 12 shots in Jrue Holiday who paced the team with 10 assists and masterfully orchestrated the unstoppable Bucks attack.

This dish was probably the best of them with Lopez getting behind the Heat defense to finish Holiday's lob pass:

The bench proved to be a big problem too with Forbes knocking down five of six three-pointers and Bobby Portis adding 14 points of his own.

Their collective effort forced Miami to play catch-up all game with Nunn having to play some hero ball to keep the Heat alive.

But Nunn's effort wasn't enough with the Bucks proving too strong. Milwaukee dominated from all over the court even outscoring Miami 50-34 in the paint.

Giannis played a big part in that difference:

He also put defenders in the spin cycle.

The Bucks benefitted from playing the Heat without Butler but their efforts were impressive nevertheless allowing Milwaukee to keep the positive momentum going with the playoffs just one week away.

Heat Can't Match Bucks' Firepower Without Butler

The Heat sorely missed Butler on this night as Miami struggled to contain Milwaukee on defense and couldn't find many answers on offense outside Nunn who kept this game from being a complete blowout.

Miami shot just 27-of-78 (34.6 percent) from the field sans Nunn. The bench in particular got nothing going shooting a combined 12-of-35.

In the starting lineup All-Star center Bam Adebayo struggled making just two of his nine shot attempts. He helped keep the offense afloat with a team-high eight assists but the Bucks' deep offense was too much to overcome.

This would clearly have been a different game with Butler on the floor. The five-time All-Star is averaging a team-high 21.5 points on 49.7 percent shooting 7.1 assists 6.9 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game. His ability to be a menace on both ends of the floor should have kept Miami in the game into the fourth quarter.

The bottom line however is that the Heat struggle without Butler. Miami is 6-13 with Butler sidelined and 33-19 otherwise this year per Basketball Reference.

His excellence on both ends has led to Butler having the fifth-most win shares in the entire NBA (9.3) per Basketball Reference.

His defense particularly in the first quarter was missed.

Ultimately this game was a very hard test for Miami against a Bucks team still having something to fight for even with the regular season winding down Sunday. The Heat fought valiantly after getting punched in the mouth after 12 minutes but Milwaukee was just too strong in the end.

What's Next?

Miami closes the regular season with a road game Sunday against the Detroit Pistons at 8 p.m. ET in Little Caesars Arena.",,,,,,,,,,,,

AP Auto Writer

DETROIT — For the next few months Charlie Gilchrist figures his 11 car dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area will sell just about every new vehicle they can get from the factories — and at increased prices.

In normal times that would be cause for joy. Not so much now. A global shortage of computer chips has forced automakers to slash production. The result has been far fewer vehicles on dealer lots just as the waning pandemic has fueled a pent-up consumer demand for cars trucks and SUVs.

Given the robust customer demand dealers like Gilchrist could sell many more cars and trucks if only they had more. Even at elevated prices — the average new-vehicle sales price tops $40000 up nearly 10% in two years — customer demand exceeds supply.

""It's pretty evident when you pull onto our lots that there's not much selection"" said Gilchrist whose lots carry brands ranging from General Motors and Ford to Nissan and Volkswagen. ""Our (sales) volume is falling because of the sheer lack of inventory. It will still fall during the next two or three months.""

The across-the-board surge in auto prices contributed mightily to last month's jump in U.S. consumer prices the government reported Wednesday. A record 10% increase in used vehicle prices in fact accounted for roughly one-third of April's overall rise in consumer prices — the sharpest monthly increase in more than a decade.

Ford expects to produce only half its normal number of vehicles from now through June. GM and others have resorted to halting production of some cars and smaller SUVs and diverting computer chips to higher-profit pickup trucks and large SUVs. Leading automakers are warning of diminished earnings.

The vehicle scarcity and the soaring prices can be traced to the eruption of the coronavirus 14 months ago. As the virus spread auto factories shut down for a couple of months. With millions more people working from home demand for laptops and monitors led semiconductor makers to shift from autos to personal electronics. Soon though a faster-than-expected economic rebound boosted demand for vehicles and auto plants tried to restore full-scale production. Yet chip makers couldn't respond swiftly enough.

With production slowed dealer inventories shrank. Now as the chip shortage has persisted the shortage of new vehicles has worsened and analysts foresee no return to normal before next year.

Yet so far automakers have been earning big profits even with a depleted inventory largely because many buyers have been willing to pay more to get what they want. With government stimulus checks and tax refunds in hand Americans bought about 1.5 million new vehicles in April. That's an adjusted annual sales rate of 18.5 million — the highest such rate since 2005.

""It's like toilet paper was a year ago"" said Michelle Krebs executive analyst for Cox Automotive. ""Everyone is rushing to buy a car.""

Cox Automotive surveys suggest that 63% of potential buyers will stay in the market even with higher prices and a meager selection of vehicles. With new vehicles prices jumping the cost of popular vehicles has become eye-opening. The average price of a new Chevrolet Silverado pickup for example is now just under $51000.

Even so the supply of vehicles is dwindling. Last month the nation's total new-vehicle inventory plummeted 42% from a year ago to 1.9 million. That's enough to supply only 33 days of sales at the current pace — 88 days fewer than a year ago according to Cox. At the same time discounts fell 5% from March to April and 25% from a year ago to an average of $3239 per vehicle.

Jeremy Smith is seeing the price increases on both ends as he buys and sells pickup trucks for his utility trailer sales business near Buffalo New York. In March he bought a used diesel 2020 Chevy Silverado crew cab with 21000 miles on for $61000. Comparable trucks are now listed on websites he said for $68000 to $70000.

At the same time he's asking $13995 for a 2011 Silverado crew cab with 178000 miles on it a far higher price than he would have thought even a few months ago.

""You sell high you buy high"" said Smith who frequently buys trucks for his business. To get one now he says people have to move quickly to put in bids with dealers or owners.

""If you're not on it"" he said ""those things are gone.""

Given the lack of supply nearly everyone expects new vehicle sales to fall soon. That would mean fewer trade-ins which would further tighten a low supply of used vehicles. For consumers who can wait analysts say it might be wise to delay buying any vehicle until next year or even beyond.

An index that measures wholesale U.S. used vehicle prices from auction house Manheim soared 53% in April from a year ago hitting a record high. Auto dealers buy used vehicles at auctions; the average price there hit nearly $18000.

Dealers mark up wholesale prices when they sell to consumers. The average list price of a used car last month was just over $22000 14% higher than a year ago.

Dealers are now scrambling for used cars hoping to sell them to keep cash flowing through the summer as new vehicle supplies dry up. Richard Bazzy who runs four Ford and Lincoln dealerships in suburban Pittsburgh said he's formed a team to buy used vehicles.

""Every car dealer in the world is jamming the auctions right now trying to fill their shelves because of the lack of new-car inventory"" he said.

Bazzy said he's hopeful that his business will manage OK with used sales as well as revenue from parts and service. But he wants all the used cars they acquire now to be sold by August when he expects the inventory of vehicles to start a return to normal.

Cox's Krebs said it's hard to predict how long the chip shortage and tight supplies will last. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cautioned investors not to expect extremely high auto prices beyond the end of this year as new-vehicle supplies recover.

The pandemic and chip shortage have made rental cars scarcer too driving up prices dramatically and causing long waits as people start traveling again. Rental companies have had trouble getting new cars because auto companies have diverted vehicles away from fleet buyers to more profitable sales to consumers. Higher demand has sent some rental companies to the used car market to find vehicles.

Whenever the car shortage ends GM Ford and others say they will change business models away from having huge stocks. GM has considered regional distribution centers that could send vehicles to dealers in a matter of days. Ford's CEO Jim Farley has talked of quickly delivering on factory orders. Both companies hope to reduce the interest paid on high inventories and keep discounts low.

""I do think we are on the verge of possibly a different kind of paradigm for how vehicles are distributed"" Krebs said.

Still competition could thwart those plans once factories return to normal production.

Bazzy normally stocks 400-500 pickup trucks at his three Ford dealers but is down to around 100. He's confident that he can keep customers happy if they order a truck and can get it in four weeks. But he fears losing business to competing brands with a huge stock.

""If the guy across the street from me has 300 (trucks) and my guy has to wait four weeks"" Bazzy said ""I'm going to lose him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzL2ZvcmQvMjAyMS8wNS8xNi9mb3JkLWJyb25jby1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWRlbGF5LzUxMTg2NDcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bronco customers learn production will be delayed in letter from Ford,"Ford Motor Co. has notified customers waiting for the all-new Ford Bronco that production dates have been delayed two weeks in some cases three weeks in others.

Ford calls the timing an ""adjustment.""

""We are still on track"" Kelli Felker Ford global manufacturing and labor communications manager told the Free Press on Sunday. ""These letters are related specifically to the downtime that we announced.""

On May 5 she confirmed a series of factory production cuts that included extending the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne for the weeks of May 17 and May 24. Felker texted the Free Press on May 5 ""Important to note that Bronco remains on track to go on sale this summer.""

Bronco production has been impacted by COVID-19 semiconductors and delays related to removable tops. An earlier notice warned of a three-month delay so this latest update seems like just a hiccup buyers said.

Jeff King vice president and general manager at Bozard Ford Lincoln in St. Augustine Florida has been talking about getting a Bronco First Edition for months. When contacted by the Free Press on Sunday he acknowledged that he too received a letter from the company. They're pushing his production date back 14 days to the week of June 28.

""It's like most things these days"" King said ""everything just takes a little longer than it used to.""

Images of letters emailed by Ford on Saturday have been provided to the Free Press and posted on social media by Bronco enthusiasts. They seemed to have time stamps between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.

Jeff Bowers shared his letter on Facebook that showed the original production date had moved from the week of June 14 to the week of July 5 for his Bronco Badlands model. He wrote that his letter arrived about 9 p.m. ET.

He wasn't alone.

Larry Martin posted an image of his letter that showed his Bronco Badlands' date had moved from the week of June 7 to the week of June 28.

Margaret Santopietro Hendricks wrote her Bronco moved from the week of June 7 to the week of June 28.

Robert Peterson said his Bronco moved from the week of June 21 to the week of July 5.

John Morris said his Bronco moved from the week of June 21 to the week of July 12.

Shane Dougherty said his Bronco moved from the week of June 28 to the week of July 19.

""At least they are consistent for the most part"" Morris wrote.

Travis Mullen posted ""What's 3 weeks when it's already been a significant wait???""

Mark Richter wrote ""My first Bronco order is #53. I have Two ordered. Why would Ford send this on a Saturday night? This is getting annoying. By the time I receive the car it will be 2022.""

Ford has said the overwhelming demand will in fact push some orders into next year.

“Fur coat and no knickers” was the considered verdict of my travelling companion as we explored the picturesque Vale of Belvoir (not a euphemism). What she – and it was a she so I think it’s OK to use the Carry On era expression – meant was that the Ford EcoSport looks all very nice and smart on the outside but the cabin and pretty much the rest of the car doesn’t really live up to initial impressions. When I asked her to look at the Ford Motor Company’s spec sheet for the car and tell me the list price her answer was damning: “£24150 including premium colour driver assistance pack heated seats and heated wheel and B&O Premium sound system”. That meant that I could no longer mansplain to her why she was wrong. She was right. As the old Ford advertising slogan didn’t quite go in this case Ford gives you less.

If you want a super-compact Ford based on a Fiesta then the current rather more modern and desirable Ford Puma is on sale and for about the same money. Strange. First the positives though. The EcoSport Active goes quite well and hardly uses any petrol (no diesel option) with its three-cylinder engine and six-speed gearbox. It’s a bit trashy and unruly if you try and push it along a country road which is fun but the steering could really have a bit more “feel” to it. The EcoSport is a smart-looking thing from most angles. It actually dates all the way back to 2012 with a few facelifts since then but it actually manages to look quite contemporary with its trendy high-up stance.

The bland dash and interior are functional but they don’t really have much showroom appeal ( Ford )

In “Active” form Ford has jacked the suspension up a bit and added some black plastic cladding around the wheel arches and sides in the way people used to slap “go-faster stripes” on any old car in the old days. The main fail are the wheels which even at 17 inches look too small for the bodywork especially when viewed from the side. This is probably to give the car the clearance and suspension travel it needs to deal with poor quality roads in places where governments can’t afford to invest in the road network (such as well Britain). I actually liked the eccentric side-hinged rear door very different to the usual hatch but opens nice and wide and of course you don’t bang your head inadvertently.

THE SPEC Ford EcoSport Active 1.0 Price: £24150 (as tested; range starts at £21350 Engine capacity: 1.0-litre petrol 3-cyl 6-so manual Power output (PS): 125 Top speed (mph): 111 0 to 60 (seconds): 11 Fuel economy (mpg): 47.1 CO2 emissions (WLTP g/km): 137

Although it seems all modern and radical it’s actually just like the tailgate you’d find on a van or estate car from the 1950s such as the Austin A35 or Hillman Husky except that the EcoSport’s wide heavy unit probably won’t last that long. Because it swings back so far it’s also a bit tricky to load it up if anyone parks behind you. I can only assume that the rear door design was chosen on the grounds of cost because everything about the insides of the EcoSport Active point to it being built down to a cost. The leather seats look inviting but feel a bit too thin and unyielding and the bland dash and interior are functional (especially the commendably simple to use sat nav) but they don’t really have much showroom appeal. A few highlights around the door cards or seats wouldn’t cost much say.

The 17in wheels look too small for the bodywork especially when viewed from the side ( Ford )

In fact the EcoSport is one of those vehicles built in and aimed at emerging markets that are sometimes brought to Europe to plug some hole in the product line-up. Another was the short-lived and obscure five-door Ford Ka+ which lacked a button to open the tailgate and was quietly dropped last year. Thus the EcoSport is or has been built in places such as Brazil India and Romania which is all fine but not if sold at the sort of prices befitting more sophisticated cars. Most manufacturers most of the time don’t embarrass themselves in this way but sometimes the prospect of a fat profit margin is simply irresistible; which I’m sorry to say is more than I can say about the EcoSport Active which is about £10000 too expensive. These days Dacia gives you more you know."

Osgood said he changed his mind after receiving unsolicited inquiries to purchase the property though he deemed them not high enough.

You see I tend to be a pretty positive person both in life and in the articles I write here at Android Central. I always try to focus on the positives as much as possible when writing a review or opinion piece and I like to give companies the benefit of the doubt (Benefit of the Doud?) whenever I can. However I've had this persistent nagging itch building for a while that I feel I must scratch and now's the time to let loose.

I've had it up to here (holds hand at the top of my 6'1"" frame) with ""smart"" watches.

Now don't get me wrong I still love to try out and experiment with smartwatches. I'm very eager to have a device manufacturer change my mind — which actually almost happened recently when I reviewed the Garmin Venu 2. That fitness-focused smartwatch has a lot going for it — it's easy to use it looks and feels nice and it has a long-lasting battery. And yet it still costs $400 and is packed with more features than I suspect most people will use or need.

I don't deny that many millions of people derive tons of value from the best smartwatches and the benefits of a good fitness watch are well-established. Yet as much as I try I just haven't been able to see the appeal of continuously wearing one. In my view smartwatches generally cost too much have short lifespans for what they are have underwhelming battery life and just try to do too much.

Sure you can find traditional wristwatches that cost much more than the latest Galaxy Watch Apple Watch or high-end Garmin but those timepieces can last decades have replaceable batteries and often emotional attachments beyond their functional purpose. And I don't know about you but I have enough devices that have built-in planned obsolescence. I don't need to feel like I need to replace a smartwatch after a few short years because the chipset is underpowered to run the OS and apps are no longer supported. Those expensive Mont Blanc and Tag Heuer Wear OS devices — who's actually buying those? They'll be bricks in two years or less.

Beyond the device's lifespan I absolutely hate that many smartwatches have to be charged every night or every few days. At least the Venu 2 that I mentioned is capable of lasting a week and a half. I love that some devices from the likes of Garmin and Casio support solar power — let's have more like this?

I'd also be curious to know how many people who use an Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch take advantage of the entire feature set or app ecosystem beyond basic fitness and sleep tracking and replying to messages. I know I'm an ""old"" but what else do you really need to do on your wrist. I've found the experience of typing on those little screens and interacting with voice assistants to be frustrating at best and it's almost never better than just pulling out my phone or laptop to accomplish the same thing. I realize there are people in certain professions (teachers doctors police etc.) who benefit from this flexibility but it seems superfluous.

I'm very nervous about what might happen to basic Fitbit trackers with these Wear OS rumors.

With rumors of an upcoming Google Pixel Watch and deeper Fitbit integration I've had some mixed emotions ahead of Google I/O 2021. I've always preferred basic fitness trackers due to their simplicity slim profile and long battery life and I remain nervous about what might come of non-smartwatch Fitbits in the coming years.

I can feel my own hypocrisy while writing this piece because I happen to be currently wearing a Fitbit Sense but I have a good reason. As much as I love my basic Inspire 2 I simply can't read it outside in the bright sunlight when I'm on a walk or a run (and truth be told my eyesight is slipping indoors too). I'm finding that I need the larger brighter screen to see the time and my workout stats. Hopefully the newly-announced Luxe will be a good compromise for me. I'll report back on that when I can.

I long for the days when my beloved Pebble Time was still alive and kicking and have been giving some serious side-eye to pseudo-smart watches like the Casio GSHOCK series (though even those are starting to get too smart for my liking). Hybrid smartwatches are an option I suppose but I'm not 100% sold on those either. Maybe I'll just go back to that cute little Amazfit Neo I reviewed last fall!

Simple notifications large bright and readable displays solid fitness tracking no unnecessary apps extra-long battery life alternative charging options (replaceable batteries wireless charging solar charging)... those are all the smarts that I need or want in a wearable. In fact I'd actually pay more for that stuff than a fancy case AMOLED screen or futuristic features.

Ok thank you for putting up with my grump old man rant. Now here is a short list of things I've come across recently that I think are pretty smart:

Amazon is finally bringing modern charging tech to its popular lineup of devices including the new Echo Buds (2nd Gen) and upcoming Fire tablets. Both will now have USB-C charging and both have options for wireless charging. Better late than never!

Facing increasing competition and pressure from Apple's AirTags and Find My and Samsung Galaxy Smart Tags Tile is doing everything it can to stay alive and relevant. From partnering with more third-party devices and companies like Fitbit to integrating with Amazon's Sidewalk initiative the O.G. device tracker seems to be making some smart moves right now. I'm pulling for them.

This past week some device renders leaked purporting to show what the new Google Pixel 6 might look like. The design has been a bit polarizing but I'm a big fan. The Pixel shine had worn off with the 4 and 5 series and if these are accurate it looks like Google is ready to make a statement with the Pixel 6.

I also wanted to highlight some of my talented colleagues' brilliant work this week. If you haven't read them yet you should tuck in:

Ara Wagoner wrote a fantastic guide to buying the best wireless charger (even I learned some things) and also expressed many of the frustrations that Chromebook fans have felt for years about the state of tablet-sized Android apps.

about the state of tablet-sized Android apps. Chris Wedel continues to show why he's our go-to guru on all things kid and family tech-related with his essay on why we're on the precipice of a golden age of parent tech.

Nick Sutrich always makes this non-gamer want to try my hand at it with his witty and informative reviews of Oculus games and hardware and his hero images are the stuff of legend.

Finally I wanted to shout out Alex Dobie for his deep dives on the new Asus Zenfone 8 and 8 Flip (be sure to watch his video above).

Okay now that I've got all that off my chest I can get back to enjoying my weekend. I hope you're doing the same because we've got a busy one coming up this week!

The Australian who won two stages during the opening week left the race mid-way through stage 8.

Ewan won stages 5 and 7 of the race and was leading the points classification as a result. He always planned to leave the Giro d'Italia before the finish in Milan on May 30 with plans to win stages in all three of cyclings Grand Tours this year. However after a frantic start to stage 8 the 26-year-old has left the race. His Lotto Soudal team took to social media to state that their rider was suffering with knee pain.



After winning stage 7 Ewan admitted that his focus was already dialed in towards goals later in the year.

""My goal remains the same for this year and I need to do what's best in preparation for the Tour. Unfortunately sprinters' legs don't recover in the same way that any other riders do and if I finished the Giro now I would be dying for the next few months.""

""This year so far has been very tough with the weather and a lot of guys legs are hurting a lot. I have to make sure I don't go so deep because if you do it's hard to start again in the next Tour.""



It took well over an hour for the day's break to form on stage 8 with several splits and attacks before Fernando Gaviria (UAE Team Emirates) Nelson Oliveira (Movistar) Kobe Goossens (Lotto Soudal) Alexis Gougeard (AG2R Citroën) Nikias Arndt (Team DSM) Victor Lafay (Cofidis) Giovanni Carboni (Bardiani-CSF-Faizane) Francesco Gavazzi (Eolo-Kometa) and Victor Campenaerts (Qhubeka Assos) moved clear.

There had been a crash in a tunnel but according to early reports Ewan had been dropped before the incident occurred.

Unfortunately @CalebEwan had to abandon #giro with pain in the knee.May 15 2021",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhcnRoeS1yZWFkeS1mb3Itc3VuZGF5cy1nYy1iYXR0bGUtaW4tZ2lyby1kaXRhbGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carthy ready for Sunday's GC battle in Giro d'Italia,"One down one to go: Hugh Carthy (EF Education-Nippo) and the other top general classification challengers in the Giro d’Italia failed to launch any attacks on Saturday's first of two uphill finishes this weekend but the Briton predicted much bigger fireworks from the favourites on Sunday’s much tougher mountain stage.

Carthy crossed the stage 8 finish line in 23rd place on Saturday moving up to fifth on GC after Belgium’s Louis Vervaeke (Alpecin-Fenix) not an overall contender shed time on the final climb of Guardia Sanframondi. Carthy remains at 38 seconds though on overall leader Attila Valter (Groupama-FDJ).

After grabbing an energy drink and jacket from a team helper in the chilly overcast afternoon the 2020 Vuelta a España podium finisher spoke briefly to reporters confirming the essentials of his current situation: he was in good condition and he expected the next climbing battle on Sunday would be a “proper GC day"".

“This [Saturday] was a calm day mostly but the end was hard” Carthy said “I’m doing fine though the legs were OK.

“It was more or less what I expected there was a bit of tension at the end there but the uphill was mainly a headwind” he added the wind direction likely quelling any thoughts of attacking among the main favourites.

Fifteenth on stage 4 to Sestola Carthy made it into the same lead group as Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and Mikel Landa (Bahrain Victorious). Two days later Carthy was distanced by the Colombian and Belgium’s Remco Evenepoel (Deceuninck-QuickStep) close to the summit of the San Giacamo ascent.

Be that as it may on each stage the gains and losses overall have been measured in handfuls of seconds - 11 to Carthy's advantage over the Simon Yates (Team BikeExchange) group on Tuesday’s steep ascent then 17 seconds ceded to Evenepoel Dan Martin (Israel Start-Up Nation) and Bernal on Thursday.

After eight days of racing Carthy therefore remains very much in the thick of the GC battle.

After Saturday’s truce for overall challengers like himself Carthy said Sunday would be a much tougher day. Or as he put it before heading to the team bus “There’ll maybe be a breakaway but either way it’ll be a fight and it’s a proper GC day.""",,,,,,

(Caps Outsider)

Whenever longtime NBC Sports Washington color commentator Craig “Locker” Laughlin sees the number 18 it brings back fond memories of his playing days at the Capital Centre in Landover where he played alongside other Caps greats such as Rod Langway Mike Gartner and Doug Jarvis while he wore that number on his jersey. So when he sought a partner to make the latest in a line of Locker 18-branded alcoholic beverages to raise money to help fight rare cancers teaming up with One Eight Distillery in D.C. was a no-brainer.

“He named his distillery after me obviously” Laughlin joked about Alex Laufer head distiller and one of the co-founders of One Eight Distillery.

On Sunday the Laughlin Family Foundation – which began in 2018 after Laughlin’s wife Linda was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer – hosted its latest fundraiser at the Northeast Washington bar. There they sold a two-pack of whiskey and vodka (with a puck!) in a decorative box with the proceeds benefiting the foundation. Caps Outsider learned that a fan who said he was several years sober bought bottles for decorative purposes and to help the foundation.

“What sets this vodka apart is the 100 proof” Laufer said. “It’s going to hold up in a cocktail a little longer.”

(Reserve your bottle here – only 120 were made!).

The whiskey and vodka combo pack was a change of pace from the foundation’s other beverages. Previously they released hazy IPAs called Laughlin 18 with Aslin Beer Company and Wicked Wrister IPA with Astro Lab Brewing while the third appropriately called The Hatty with Pherm Brewing Company is coming soon (read The Washington Post’s article about this).

What’s next? Expect more beverages. Laughlin is brimming with ideas including a Canadian shandy with ginger (I may be off on these details as he told me this over cocktails). And with all the success the beverages have had for the foundation might we see… Locker 18-branded drinks for sale all the time? Don’t bet against it.

But for now the beverage sales continue to bring in money for the foundation which has raised over $150000 so far despite Covid 19 forcing events to be cancelled.

“Well I love beer I love vodka I love whiskey” Laughlin said. “Let’s do something for the foundation to keep this thing relevant because we don’t want it to fall to the wayside. Let’s keep trying to build it because the cost of doing this research for rare cancers in immense.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvdGhlLW5ldHdvcmstaXMtZGVhZC1hbmQtZnV0dXJlLWxvb2tzLXNhc2UtcGFsby1hbHRvLW5ldHdvcmtzLXN2cC1zYXlzLzIwMjEvMDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Network Is Dead' and Future Looks SASE Palo Alto Networks SVP Says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/the-network-is-dead-and-future-looks-sase-palo-alto-networks-svp-says/2021/05/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvdGhlLW5ldHdvcmstaXMtZGVhZC1hbmQtZnV0dXJlLWxvb2tzLXNhc2UtcGFsby1hbHRvLW5ldHdvcmtzLXN2cC1zYXlzLzIwMjEvMDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

The component provides the best of propulsion in both subsonic and supersonic flight regimes.

And recently GE completed the first tests with the prototype XA100 the first engine manufactured by the adaptive cycle company aimed at the market. The project has significant funding from the United States Air Force (USAF) and development has been taking place since 2007.

GE said that testing with the XA100 began in December 2020. Since then the concept has been being tested in the laboratory to assess the performance and mechanical behavior of the engine.

The engine met the objectives of the USAF Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) the company says.

“We were exceptionally satisfied with the performance of the engine during the test” said David Tweedie GE Edison Works general manager for Advanced Combat Engines. “We look forward to working with the Air Force and other stakeholders to identify next steps to bring this revolutionary test cell capability into the hands of the warrior.”

The AETP program intends to develop several technologies that can make supersonic engines up to 25% more fuel efficient which with other improvements could result in up to 30% less consumption per supersonic aircraft.

O video below shows the engine alternating between the three cycles:

An adaptive cycle engine proposes to add a secondary flow of air flow in conditions of cruising speed this secondary duct can be closed when it is necessary to accelerate quickly. In the video above we can also see that there is a duct where only cold air passes this can even be used to lower the temperature of the engine increasing efficiency in the hot part of it.

Unlike a common turbofan engine where the air only has two paths to pass the cold cycle and the hot cycle the latter being burned in the combustion chamber.

This engine will likely find its first application in a powered version of the Lockheed Martin F-35 currently powered by Pratt & Whitney F135 engines. The better efficiency of this engine especially in the subsonic regime allows a greater range for the F-35 whether in a combat situation or in a transfer flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uYy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzE1L3BpcGVsaW5lLWltcGFjdC0tdG93LXRydWNrcy1yZWFkeS10by1iYWlsLXBlb3BsZS1vdXQtaWYtdGhleS1ydW4tb3V0LW9mLWdhcy3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tow Trucks ready to bail people out if they run out of gas,"CARY N.C. — Gas remains scarce in the triangle following the reopening of the Colonial Pipeline on Wednesday night.

Colt-Land Towing & Recovery in Cary has been in businesses for 22 years.

Jackson Wetherby has been helping his step-father run the business for the past three years.

Wetherby said normal protocol for a driver who ran out of gas would be to bring them gas to refuel or take them to a nearby gas station. But he said due to panic buying that's licked the pumps dry that's currently not an option.

“Our biggest way is just trying to help people get their vehicles to a safe area to be able to wait until there is gas available” Wetherby said.

He said on a normal day they only receive one to two calls for help.

""It’s actually been keeping people at home for the most part"" Wetherby said.

Wetherby says it's only a matter of time before the calls start coming in.

For drivers who may find themselves teetering on the edge of empty and not able to make it to a gas station or find gas near them Wetherby offered some advice.

""If you realize you’re going to run out of gas before you get somewhere safe just make sure you’re pulling off the side of the road away from a lot of traffic. It gives you space so you're safe and away from traffic. It also gives us space to come and help you in any way"" Wetherby said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmlnLXR3aW4taW5zaWRlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXR3aW4tZW5naW5lLWNhcmdvLXBsYW5lLTIwMjEtNdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmlnLXR3aW4taW5zaWRlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXR3aW4tZW5naW5lLWNhcmdvLXBsYW5lLTIwMjEtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Twin: Inside the making of the world's largest 2-engine cargo plane,"Right now the Boeing 747 is the largest mainstream cargo plane but its reign may be coming to an end.

So the best examples of rivalries are the Airbus 350 and Boeing 787.

Boeing 787

The Boeing 787 also known as the Dreamliner is a mid-sized wide-body aircraft manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The program was launched on April 26 2004 with an order for 50 from All Nippon Airways to be launched in 2008. On July 8 2007 the prototype was rolled out without major systems and experienced multiple delays until its maiden flight on December 15 2009. The first 787-8 was delivered in September 2011 before entering commercial service on October 26 2011 with ANA. The aircraft was designed to be more fuel-efficient than its predecessor the Boeing 767 and succeeded in being 20 percent more fuel-efficient.

Unlike other aircraft including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8i which were launched in the early 2000s the Dreamliner’s strong point was not size but performance. Boeing decided to go smaller with the Dreamliner planning on taking the twin-engine revolution wave that the manufacturer helped launch the Boeing 777 its best-selling aircraft of all time. It was a high-stakes gamble that would determine the future of Boeing in the industry for years to come.

The aircraft used GE GEnx or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines making it 20% more fuel-efficient than the 767 engines. All-electric bleed fewer systems are used in these engines eliminating the need for superheated air ducts generally used for air conditioning anti-icing and other functions. The B787 finally flew for the first time on December 15 2009 marking the start of the next generation aviation revolution and immediately turning out to be obsolete iconic aircraft like Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. After a year and a half of the test flights the first Dreamliner was delivered to All Nippon Airways on September 26 2011 almost ten years after its order.

The initial 57 m long 787-8 seats 242 passengers over 13620 km with an MTOW of 228 t compared to 254 t for later variants. It is 787-9 63 m long and can travel 14140 km with 290 passengers; it entered service with ANA on August 7 2014. The further extended 787-10 68 m long with 330 seats over 11910 km entered the service with Singapore Airlines in 2018.

The flight deck of Dreamliner has dual HUD screens wide PDF/MFD displays and looks a bit like a spaceship. The total onboard electrical power of the 787 is 1.45 megawatts. That’s five times as much power as conventional airliners. The size of the windows is the largest of any aircraft to date 47 by 28 centimeters (or 19 inches high). According to Boeing this makes the 787 windows 65 percent larger than any other aircraft window.

There are 3 Dreamliner variants the 787-8 being the first variant to fly in December 2009 the longer 787-9 in September 2013 followed by the longest 787-10 in March 2017.

As of December 2019 there were 864 Boeing 787 aircraft in the airline service. All Nippon Airways (74) United Airlines (60) Japan Airlines (47) American Airlines (45) Etihad Airways (39) Air Canada (37) Qatar Airways (37) British Airways (32) Air India (27) and other airlines were operating less of the type.

Airbus 350

The Airbus 350 also known as A350 XWB is a family of long-range large-scale airliners developed by Airbus. The first A350 design was proposed by Airbus in 2004 in response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in the development of new wings and engines. The A350 XWB is the first Airbus aircraft mainly made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer. It succeeds the A340 and can compete against Boeing’s large long-haul twin jets: the 787-10 then 777 and its successor the 777X.

Airbus first approved the Airbus 350 program in 2006 in response to the Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliner programs which became popular with airlines and highlighted the failings of Airbus in the twin-engine market. Two years before the first flight of the A380s Boeing had announced that it was developing a new aircraft with only two engines which had led to the success of the 777. However later that year Airbus decided to design a new clean two-engine carbon slate aircraft and the A350 was born in its final form an effort of $13 billion.

The A350 XWB is the first Airbus aircraft mainly made of carbon fiber enhanced polymer. It had a new fuselage designed around a cross-section of the nine-abreast economy. The airliner has two variants: the A350-900 carries typically between 300 and 350 passengers over a 15000-kilometre range has a maximum take-off weight of 280 tons (MTOW); the longer the A350-1000 facilitates between 350 and 410 passengers with a full range of 16100 km and an MTOW of 319 tonnes.

The A350 used only 84000–97000 lbf (370–430 kN) of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB power. The A350 includes new composite wings with wingspans that are common to the proposed variants. Its 64.75 m wingspan is within the same ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code E 65m limit as the A330/A340 and Boeing 777. A vital feature of the aircraft would also be included in its full name A350 Extra Wide Body or XWB with a cabin width slightly larger than the 787’s at 5.61 meters. The aircraft cockpit would be one of the most technologically advanced aircraft to feature on an Airbus jet with pilots receiving information from high-definition screens and having access to multiple outdoor cameras.

In June 2011 the Airbus 350-900 was planned to enter service in the first half of 2014 with the-800 to enter service in mid-2016 and the-1000 to enter service in 2017. In July 2012 Airbus delayed introducing the-900 by three months until the second half of 2014. The first delivery to launch the Qatar Airways customer took place on December 22 2014. The first commercial flight took place between Doha and Frankfurt on January 15 2015.

As of December 2020 397 A350 aircraft were in service with 33 operators. The largest operators were Qatar Airways (53) Singapore Airlines (52) Cathay Pacific (40) Lufthansa (17) Fin air (16) Ethiopian Airlines (16) Delta Air Lines (15) Vietnam Airlines (14) China Airlines (14) and other smaller-scale airlines.

If we removed its name from these aircraft the forthcoming Airbus A350XWB passenger jet could easily be confused with its primary rival the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It’ll take a while before you can easily distinguish one from the other. Both aircraft are very well known for their performance. So if we think of flagship aircraft we think of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or the Airbus A350. Both represent the very best ideas cutting-edge technology and one could even say that they represent the best of Boeing or Airbus. So these aircraft can be stated as the successful aircraft of these decades.",,,

ZACH WILSON'S MOM SAYS JETS QB IS A SAVAGE: 'DON’T LET THIS UTAH BOY FOOL YOU'

Poking at her fans she says in the clip: ""Some of you guys have not read a book don’t know how to do your taxes have no sense of identity outside the internet and can’t speak in public.""

She demanded kids do more than just be a look.

""Who cares? Spell ‘pharaoh.’ Tell me what the FTC does"" she challenged.

She said it’s not ""hot"" if the only youth hobby is media consumption.

The post has since been deleted after teens online called for her cancellation.

She still has her fanbase: an army of ""Glam Demonators"" as well as a Twitter account that translates her politics.

Her advice for young women: ""Never lower your standards and never sacrifice your beliefs or who you are as a person for what’s popular or what people around you are doing.

Title update 4.0 went live last week and in a blog post Ubisoft revealed some new features coming with the 4.5 update.

The headline addition is the 60fps performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Ubisoft said this is ""one of the biggest requests from our next-gen console players"".

As Digital Foundry reported last year Watch Dogs: Legion launched at 30fps on all three next-gen systems: PS5 Xbox Series X and S.

""I do wonder if an optional performance mode could deliver 60fps gameplay too"" Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia pondered. ""According to the config files on PC there was a 60fps mode in the works for PS5 and Xbox Series X at some point but that is not the case in the final version of the game. Perhaps that will arrive at a later point.""

Meanwhile Legion's 4.5 update fixes a raft of bugs and issues many of which have to do with recently-released DLC character Mina and adds the Tactical Op Project OMNI.

Ubisoft has yet to announce a release date for TU 4.5 and it said the patch notes will be published closer to launch.

Whether it’s to tide us over until the next big update or offer some insight into its ever-expanding lore there’s always something to do.

The Energy Amplifier event doesn’t offer a ton of reason to dive into the story of the game but it does bring with it plenty of challenges such as true RPG team-building and the potential for a silly amount of free Primogems. Here’s how to complete the Energy Amplifier event in Genshin Impact from how to get a free four-star character and loads of free pulls to where to find all the Mutation Stones that can make the event much harder than it needs to be.

What is Energy Amplifier? The Genshin Impact 1.5 event explained

The Genshin Impact Energy Amplifier event looks more complicated than it really is. Taking cues from past events like Unreconciled Stars and Hypostatic Symphony this one has you collect Fractured Fruit Fragments and Shards from mob camps buffed by nearby Mutation Stones. Each of these Fractured Fruit pieces then unlock equippable buffs you can use to challenge new domains for additional rewards.

As you stack difficulty multipliers onto the final event domain — Twisted Realm — to increase the points you gain across its four floors better management of your available buffs becomes essential. Find the perfect loadout for your team and you’ll accumulate enough of the event currency to buy anything from Upgrade Materials to Primogems from the event shop. The event starts automatically with the Mr. Melancholy quest. Just head into Liyue and talk to the researcher to kick things off.

Is the Energy Amplifier event co-op/multiplayer?

With so many moving parts throughout this event it’s hard to tell whether it’s built with co-op in mind. Some of it clearly is: you can have separate Fractured Fruit buff loadouts for single player and co-op runs but the rest is a little unclear.

Turns out though virtually every part of the event can be completed with friends. The three domains split across Acts I-III can be completed in a group. You just have to have your buddies join your world beforehand. Then when you head into the Character Select screen of each domain you’ll be prompted to open it up to the others in your world.

As for the Mutation Stone camp clears listed below though you’re free to clear these with whoever happens to be on your world it’ll only clear in your world. They’ll have to go back and clear it on their own world to collect their own rewards.

How to get Diona for free

Whichever side of the event fence you’re on there’s something to gain from it: primarily a free Diona to add to your character roster. Unlike the Lantern Rite Festival event which took a lot of time and effort to get the free Liyue character choice out of this event can net you a free Diona in 20 or so minutes right at the start of the event. Here’s how to do it.

To get a free Diona during the Energy Amplifier event you have to “invite” her through the Initiation event screen. Doing so costs 1000 Fractured Fruit Data which is the simple event currency you get for doing just about any of the event tasks listed below.

By the time you’ve completed the Act I stage (and the short Domain at the end) you’ll have more than enough of the stuff needed to invite Diona into your squad. Just open up the event screen again and hit the corresponding button where it says “Diona” to make the trade and get a free four-star character before the event ends.

Fractured Fruit Fragments: All Mutation Stone locations

As your first task during the Energy Amplifier event you’ll be sent on a trip around Teyvat to recover Fractured Fruit Fragments from specific places of interest. These crystals — which you’ll rely on to help clear the dungeons later in the event — are all guarded by monsters buffed insurmountably by nearby rocks called Mutation Stones. Attempt to fight the camps without destroying the Mutation Stones and even a regular hilichurl archer has the potential to one-shot your best character.

These places of interest make up three acts with each act having nine enemy camps split between three locations to hit up and clear out. Open up the Event screen tap into the Act you want to progress through and then the specific place of interest. Finally hit Navigate on the first entry and you’ll be directed to the other two in sequence as you collect the Fruit Fragment.

Though the camps are pinpointed on the map the Mutation Stones that buff them are not. Below are all the Mutation Stone locations so that you’re never forced to fight these ferocious monsters at their buffed-up best. Sneak up on the stones without alerting the nearby enemies and you’ll have a much quicker and easier time clearing the camps collecting the Fragmented Fruits and earning some free Primogems event currency and other goodies.

Vishap’s Rest: Act I Domain Best Characters

This first run is nothing special. Despite the Electro/Cryo recommendation neither are actually necessary. Just bring a Geo character if possible to make the last fight a little easier.

Hop across the waterway beat up the slimes snipe the two archers either side of the door and it’ll open up revealing another pack of monsters for you to dispatch. This isn’t too dissimilar to a regular hilichurl camp. Just take them out then use the wooden boards along the wall to climb up and into the area to the left. Activate the switch and ride the air currents to the final arena.

Here Geovishaps Hatchlings will challenge you to a fight. Use shields (if available) to knock them over and burst them down. Finally a standard Geovishap will come along with a smaller buddy. Not much changes here but keep some stamina in reserve to dodge some of its heavier attacks. Clear the fight and you’ll win some free Primogems.

Where Shadows Writhe: Act II Domain Best Characters

This one can be quite difficult. It’s a time attack challenge with a bunch of different elements in play. To make matters worse the arena in each of the three rooms will be surrounded by an electrical field that will strike your characters for heavy damage should they venture out too far. You can heal through it with Elemental Bursts from characters like Qiqi Bennett and Diona but you’re better off finding a way to ensure the enemies stay within reach.

The first room is simple enough: Just a few slimes and Hilichurls. But it’s the second room guarded by Fatui enemies like Sharpshooters and Agents that can cause a problem if you don’t bring the elements needed to break their powerful shields.

Electro and Water is recommended for a reason. Characters like Fischl Xingqui and Lisa can work well on a budget but Mona Tartaglia and Keqing are the five-star characters you’ll likely want to bring if you have them. Venti (or a weapon like The Viridescent Hunt) can help keep enemies pinned to the middle of the arena so that you don’t have to deal with the outer electrical field. Just make sure you bring a ranged character to deal with stragglers or a decent healer or shielder to ensure melee brawlers can fight on the outer edge of the arena without dying to the lightning.

Frost-Worn Space: Act III Domain Best Characters

This final dungeon is a cinch. It really is. But you have to bring a Pyro user to activate the switches to open the doors to each chamber. Diluc and Bennett work well as a team here but Hu Tao Klee and Yanfei can all work wonders. Just bring a healer or shielder for support and an Anemo user if you want to abuse Swirl for heavy damage.

The only real gimmick is at the very end of the run. Defeat the monsters in each chamber and you’ll finally go up against a Frostarm Lawachurl who after losing around 30% HP spawns a bunch of Hilichurls to aid and heal him. Beat them up as you normally would (or use Venti or a Viridescent weapon to group them up) and continue the fight against the main monster once these have fallen. With that you’ll complete Act III.

Twisted Realm: Best Characters and How to Beat Each Domain

Once you’re done collecting all the buffs you think you might need it’s time to head to the Twisted Realm – the true challenge of the Energy Amplification event. The four challenges here are similar to the domains unlocked as the event went on. Only this time you can apply difficulty modifiers to multiply the points gained at the end accumulating more event currency as you go. These can be tough but by choosing the modifiers that have little to no effect on your chosen party composition and then offsetting any with Energy Amplifier buffs can help you reap the rewards without dramatically increasing the challenge – and gain around 240 Primogems just for trying.

Domain of Deceit

Recommended Elements : Geo

: Geo Best Characters: Zhongli Albedo Geo Traveler

The first challenge of the Twisted Realm pits you against six members of the Geovishap species across three waves; two hatchlings one hatchling and an adult then a final wave of two adult Geovishaps. These can be just as painful as they are in the overworld but by bringing one or two Geo characters you can have shields carry you through most of the challenge.

Keeping some stamina in reserve is good practice against Geovishaps regardless of context but it’s even more important here — defeated enemies eventually explode for area damage and fissures will regularly spawn beneath you making evasion a real luxury.

Watch their attacks and time Geo shields to knock them down. Immobilizing them in any way really makes things easier so if you don’t have access to Zhongli and his Petify ability bringing along a Hydro and Cryo character for Freeze will go a long way in minimizing the dance you need to do to survive these rapid attackers.

Domain of Furious Thunder

Recommended Elements : Cryo Hydro

: Cryo Hydro Best Characters: Barbara Mona Qiqi

This one reintroduces the pesky Electro field that pins you to the middle of the arena. The first two waves shouldn’t pose too much of a problem so long as you keep enough energy to dodge the axes and arrows coming in from all directions but the final will probably require a healer or shielder.

The ring shrinks so much in the final wave that dealing with the two ranged Pyroslinger Bracers can be tricky without heading into the thunder so it’s important to be able to take the terrain hits without wiping your team at the finish line.

It’s entirely possible to complete this without any of the recommended characters or elements by setting up a team that can virtually ignore the terrain challenge but as you ramp up the difficulty the need for these will become more apparent.

Domain of Chaos

Recommended Elements : Hydro Cryo

: Hydro Cryo Best Characters: Any bow user any Geo user

The Domain of Chaos throws five Ruin constructs at you in waves of two one two; Ruin Guards first then a Ruin Hunter and two Ruin Graders at the end. The apparent gimmick of this is the large Chaos Cluster orbs slowly approaching you periodically during the fight. They’re supposed to deal “immense” damage if they hit you but by bringing a team that’s able to cycle between Elemental Bursts you can use the invulnerability periods to negate virtually any major spikes of damage. Bring a character like Bennett to set up a healing field and you should be all set to stay on the offensive only occasionally dodging to either side to avoid some stomps and slaps. Geo shields can help and bow users can immobilize the trickier Ruin Hunter but with enough foresight and awareness nothing here should really pose much of a threat.

Domain of Heresy

Recommended Elements : Cryo

: Cryo Best Characters: Venti (or Viridscent weapon) Diluc Ganyu

This final domain contains a single Abyss Herald – Wicked Torrents and a bunch of monsters that if left alone will heal the Herald rapidly. These blighters will respawn periodically so long as the Herald doesn’t lose enough HP to knock him into his Dark Descent state but the fewer monsters left the less he’ll be healed.

With all this in mind there are two approaches you can take: Using a character like Venti or a Viridescent weapon to gather all the monsters up and use a powerful Elemental Burst (like Diluc’s) to dispatch them in one go or picking them off individually in the hopes of outpacing the reduced healing with your own heavy attacks.

Once it enters Dark Descent Abyss Herald – Wicked Torrents fights like Childe or a Fatui Agent only with heavy Hydro-based attacks. Cryo can easily abuse its shield but a team of Electro and Pyro characters can also deal enough raw damage with their constant elemental reactions to deal with this beast even through its strong shell.

Knight partake in a wonderful virtual reunion with fans,"Kim Delaney in 'General Hospital.' Photo by ABC Todd Wawrychuk.

On May 16 Emmy award-winning actors Kim Delaney and Michael E. Knight participated in a wonderful virtual fan reunion which was produced by Coastal Entertainment. Digital Journal has the scoop.

Both actors star in the hit ABC daytime drama series General Hospital. Delaney portrays Jackie Templeton while Knight plays Martin Gray.

Aside from General Hospital Delaney is known for her roles in All My Children NYPD Blue Philly CSI: Miami as well as Army Wives. They shared stories and favorite storylines while working together in the defunct soap opera All My Children which was created by the late but great Agnes Nixon.

Veteran filmmaker and actor Bill Timoney also made a special cameo in this online fan event which was an added treat as he interacted with Knight and Delaney.

A portion of the proceeds from this Zoom event benefits the nonprofit organization Contractors for Kids which provides financial relief to families affected by injury sickness or death of a child in the Long Island area. To learn more about the charitable organization Contractors for Kids visit its official website.

On the greatest lesson that the acting profession has ever taught them Delaney responded “The acting profession has taught me how to listen. That’s helpful and key not only in acting but in life. It made me realize that I need to stop talking and listening more that’s the first thing that comes to mind.”

“The greatest lesson that the soaps have ever taught me is to have a relationship with people” Knight said. “One of the great things that we have going for us on soaps is that we get to work with the same people because they are family. They give you the dialogue and they give you the story but you realize eventually that you are falling backward in a relationship that you have with these people. As an actor when I do other things I look for that.”

“Listening is incredibly important in all facets of acting and life” Bill Timoney said. “I do a lot of coaching with young actors and I very often say: ‘what do you want?’ and ‘what’s in your way?’ What is your objective and what is your obstacle? Then I go ‘who is winning?’ and ‘who is losing?’ A really well-written soap opera scene will see the two people in the scene change winning and losing several times within that scene. It’s a really interesting way to approach the work and it’s a very productive way too.”

“There has been lots of discussions among the world's scholars and central bankers about national crypto money and its interrelation with cryptocurrencies. Particularly many researches has been conducted about cryptocurrencies regulations and their impact on monetary and forex policies.” Hemmati wrote in an Instagram statement.



CBI Governor added: “Central bank of Islamic Republic of Iran has a clear responsibility by the law to maintain value of our national currency and regulate every forms of monetary transactions within our economic structure. Introduction of national crypto-money will positively impact the economy. Managing the money flow Internationalization of Rial and even remodeling the structure of monetary-system are among the matters that will be affected; therefore the CBI visited this matter thoroughly and analyzed different aspect of dealing with the phenomenon.”



Earlier this year Hemmati announced that the CBI has already finished drafting the executive plan to issue Iranian Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and it is being debated in a special expert committee. “Soon after its approval and completion there will be a step by step implementation strategy and a pilot launch program.” Hemmati continued.



Describing the upcoming CBDC Hemmati said: “Digital Rial will be in form of a stable crypto currency and its value will be anchored to existing traditional paper Rial. The main difference is that its application environment will change.”



According to Iran top central Banker Digital Rial will not be minable and although a similar technology will be utilized to issue Digital Rial it will not be the same as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum."

GD,General Dynamics,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2JpbGxpb25zLWF0LXN0YWtlLWFzLXVzLW1hcmluZXMtc2Vlay1hLW5ldy1hcm1vcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billions at Stake as U.S. Marines Seek a New Armored Vehicle,"General Dynamics will probably win -- but what if it doesn't?

The light armored vehicle (LAV) is not a ""tank"" exactly -- but since its introduction in 1983 General Dynamics (GD 0.77%) and its predecessor companies have sold more than 10000 around the world. That's about as many Light Armored Vehicles as it's sold Abrams main battle tanks. At recent prices running to $4.3 million apiece the LAV has evolved into a multibillion-dollar franchise for the giant defense contractor.

But now it's at risk.

Tanks for the memories LAV

In 2019 the U.S. Marine Corps the original buyer of the LAV announced a project to replace the Corps' venerable armored vehicle with a new ""modern Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle ... highly mobile networked transportable protected and lethal"" aiming to begin the switchover in the late 2020s.

As the legacy provider General Dynamics was quickly tapped to offer a prototype ARV to replace the Marine Corps' fleet of 600 LAV-25s last year. BAE Systems which manufactures the Marine Corps' Amphibious Combat Vehicle is also expected to bid. SAIC (SAIC 1.10%) entered the competition in 2019 but has since dropped out.

General Dynamics' toughest competition of all however for the upcoming ARV contract may come from a joint bid by rival U.S. armor-maker Textron (TXT 1.35%) and its Israeli partner Elbit Systems (ESLT -0.84%). Last week the two companies jointly announced plans to offer the U.S. Marine Corps a ""transformational"" light tank by the name of ""Cottonmouth"" to serve as the new ARV.

Introducing the Cottonmouth

Technical specifications of Textron's prototype have not been released. But images of the Cottonmouth prototype show it to be an amphibious six-wheeled low-profile armored vehicle equipped with an anti-tank missile launcher and a remotely operated gun system. To meet USMC requirements the Cottonmouth would need to weigh no more than 18.5 tons so that a single ""Ship-to-Shore Connector"" (a large hovercraft) could carry four ARVs at a time from an amphibious warship to assault a beach.

Inside the Cottonmouth will feature ""360° Situational Awareness"" from Elbit utilizing external cameras to display the vehicle's surroundings inside on crew workstations and on individual ""IronVision Helmet Mounted Displays."" With this tech the ARV's crew will be able to effectively ""see through"" the ARV's armor in all directions.

What it means to General Dynamics ... and to Textron

Winning the ARV competition would be big business for any company -- but for Textron especially.

Consider that analysts estimate that an ARV contract could yield sales of $1.8 billion to $6.8 billion over five years to the winner depending on the prices the competitors bid. If accurate this implies a unit cost of $3.6 million to $13.6 million on the estimated 500 ARVs that the USMC would require.

That's quite a lot considering that General Dynamics is still selling LAVs for about $4.3 million. In theory General Dynamics could make even more money selling the USMC 500 ARVs than it's made already selling them 600 LAVs. And according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence General Dynamics' Combat Systems division which builds the LAV and would build the ARV is General Dynamics' most profitable division boasting an operating profit margin of 14.4% on its sales. For its part Textron earns only 11.6% profit margins at its smaller Textron Systems business which would be responsible for Cottonmouth production. (And Elbit's operating margin is even smaller -- just 7% for the entire company).

If the ARV contract ends up being worth $6.8 billion that would still be less than one year's Combat Systems sales for giant General Dynamics which booked $7.2 billion in sales last year -- moving the needle for giant GD but perhaps not by much. $6.8 billion for Textron on the other hand would be more money than its tiny Textron Systems division generates in over five years of work. For Elbit a $6.8 billion contract would be more money than the entire company makes in a year.

A win on ARV for General Dynamics therefore would be welcome news and help maintain the profitability of what is currently General Dynamics' most profitable division. A win for Textron and Elbit on the other hand could transform each of those companies into vastly more profitable businesses for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvZGVwaW5rLm9yZy8wNTE2MjAyMV9ibGFja3JvY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock Shareholders Protest Planning Meeting - CODEPINK - Women for Peace,"Join CODEPINK as we plan our All Eyes on BlackRock Protest!

While CODEPINK has an ongoing campaign urging BlackRock to divest from all weapon manufacturers this year we also ask that BlackRock support human rights for this shareholder season.

WHEN: Sunday May 16th at 3PM EST

WHERE: Zoom

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager controlling more than $5 trillion in assets globally. BlackRock released a statement indicating that it would like companies to implement and disclose their human rights processes to identify manage and prevent adverse human rights impacts. But yet BlackRock is one of the largest shareholders of Tasers manufacturer Axon enterprise and has $7.25 billion invested in Boeing $3.3 billion in General Dynamics $5.6 billion in Lockheed Martin $3.4 billion in Northrop Grumman and $4 billion in Raytheon. Weapons made by these companies are being used in Palestine Syria Iraq Yemen and other places around the world where the US continues to be involved in active conflicts. As you can see even though BlackRock said it would like companies to implement human rights processes they continue to profit from war. BlackRock even has an iShares fund that exclusively benefits from weapons of war.

At this planning meeting for the upcoming May 25th protest of the BlackRock Shareholders meeting we’ll update everyone on some working plans including introducing our speakers and musicians as well as thinking through run-of-day logistics and roles for the day of the protest.

Meanwhile the last year's lockdown probably saw you ordering more takeout and delivery than ever. Unfortunately these two trends conflict in a way you might want to know about. With pizza as the most-ordered food this past year advocates are calling out America's biggest pizza brand for inhumane treatment of the animals that become our food.

Late Friday animal advocacy group The Humane League contacted Eat This Not That! editors with a report that may warrant awareness. In the report entitled ""The Price of a Slice"" the organization states that 200 food companies have willingly committed to a new chicken welfare policy that eliminates the cruelest factory farming practices from their supply chains. Those companies that have committed to good for chickens include well known brands like Chipotle Burger King Popeyes Papa John's Starbucks Subway Denny's and more.

This Is the Best Supermarket in America New Survey Says

While a lot of fast food brands family restaurants and manufacturers like General Mills and Kraft Heinz appear on the list of companies that have committed to kinder chicken welfare the number of pizza chains leaves plenty to be desired. The Humane League says big pizza brands have failed to commit to the same animal welfare supply chain practices. The list of these chains includes Domino's—which is the top-selling pizza in America—along with Pizza Hut Little Caesar's Sbarro Marco's Pizza and many more.

Shown is the Humane League's list of pizza chains they're calling on for better animal welfare practices:

The Humane League says these pizza chains allow inhumane practices in the treatment of chickens in particular. Here's what they detail:

Crowded by the tens of thousands into sheds with no room to move around. Standing in their own waste because their sheds are almost never cleaned during their lifetime. Bred to grow so heavy at such a rapid rate that many can't even stand up. Killed using a brutal system called ""live-shackle slaughter"" leaving half a million chickens boiled alive each year. These pizza restaurants allow this to go on every day. They have refused to ban these practices from their supply chains and they have never released a public statement about their standards for chicken welfare.

We all know that making the healthier more conscious transition to eating less meat products takes sacrifice intention and commitment. But the insights we gain from reports like this might better inform where we want to order from next time the house has a craving for barbecue chicken pizza wings or chicken tenders.

I grew up in Buffalo but live in Texas (under protest). I get to see Buffalo from a distance in winter and up close in the summer. I bike ride the Olmsted and I can see the treasures as well as the mistakes up close and personal. I find the uproar over the Skyway a distraction from the glaring mistakes and damage done by the Kensington and Scajaquada.

We should prioritize fixing our mistakes before we venture into a debate on tearing down cloud-parking or keeping the Skyway. Restoring Humboldt Parkway reuniting the neighborhoods and transforming the stagnant Scajaquada into a beautiful linear park connecting the Olmsted’s should easily top the agenda before attacking or defending a roadway that has stood the test of time and has done minimal damage compared to the Kensington and Scajaquada.

Fix the mistakes that are known; we shouldn’t waste our efforts on projects that have yet to show their value.

Having three children under 8 leisure time is hard to find. However one can pack a picnic lunch load up the car and say: ""Let’s go to the beach and play."" The children know the route we take with the Skyway and with shining happy faces they feel the magic: Sparkling waters on the lake majestic battleships in place bird’s eye view of everything on the upswing.

Soon a picnic playtime and fun watching boats sail and fishermen casting a line hoping for a win and getting a fish.

It’s not too difficult to get back home in the city. And the kids watching as we go upwards … they point to their Cheerios home and then watch the city appear looking elegant and classy the way it’s always been … a beautifully lit city welcoming one back home.

Gone now are the stresses of one’s day: Please stay beloved Skyway.

Sean Kirst: 'Shame to lose' or 'obsolete highway?' Readers are passionate about the Skyway In the minority were readers who support demolishing the bridge while others advocate keeping a piece of it as a recreational ""CloudWalk.""

• • •

The Skyway is an obsolete highway that takes up valuable waterfront land that could be better used. Just like the Robert Moses Parkway in Niagara Falls there's no reason Buffalo needs an expressway near the waterfront when there's an alternative highway (I-90) inland.

I also feel that preserving the Skyway as a CloudWalk is shortsighted and dangerous. It wasn't built for pedestrians and it's located in an area that's frequently windy rainy snowy and cold. Everyone who's been to downtown Buffalo knows how gusty it can get and people will be 100 feet up on a bridge. CloudWalk proponents aren't taking the climate and weather into consideration.

The liability insurance the state would have to pay to keep the Skyway in use for pedestrians as well as maintenance costs could be better spent on projects that correct Buffalo's past planning mistakes.

Buffalo is an Olmstedian city. One of the wisest decisions Buffalo leaders ever made was to invite Olmsted and Vaux whose park and parkway system reinvented the city. One of the most foolish decisions Buffalo leaders ever made was to sacrifice that system for expressways. To undo that damage we need to take the same systematic approach as Olmsted and Vaux. If we do we can reinvent our city again.

But without comprehensive systematic planning for our urban expressways we risk wasting billions on piecemeal vanity projects like the recent Skyway proposals. Politicians shouldn’t be doing our planning and we also can’t leave it to the transportation planners and engineers who built this problem. There is a vital role here for the UB Regional Institute which led our most recent systematic planning efforts like Queen City Hub and One Region Forward.

Where to start? Our Olmstedian corridors of course. Restore the Humboldt Parkway section of the 33 as the Restore Our Community Coalition has envisioned. Re-envision the Scajaquada Corridor as Buffalo’s version of Olmsted’s Emerald Necklace: our “Emerald Crescent.”

As for the 190 which cuts the city off from our waterfront look to the west side of Manhattan. There an elevated highway was replaced by a boulevard and a waterfront greenway. At the same time rethink use of the Peace Bridge as a primary freight crossing for which it was never intended.

Ironically the lowest priority should be the Skyway. It’s actually the least problematic of all the urban highways and has far less waterfront impact than a replacement “low-level” bridge with enormous ramps at the water’s edge. Plan its future along with the 190.

A century and a half ago Buffalo leaders remade their city by embracing the systematic planning of Olmsted and Vaux. Today’s leaders need their wisdom.

The Prime Minister of Italy Giuseppe Conte wearing a facial mask attended the insertion of the final 150-foot section of the 3500-foot-long spine of the celebrated Morandi Bridge in Genoa (Buffalo News 4/29/20). The new bridge has solar panels.

The Morandi Bridge designed by Renzo Piano (co-architect of the Pompidou Center in Paris) is very much like our Buffalo Skyway according to famed architectural historian Dr. Frank R. Kowsky.

Why would Buffalo tear down a structure similar to what Italy is celebrating with the red green and white lights of the Italian national flag? Why not keep our beautiful Skyway and add solar panels?

I don't support the cost involved in tearing down the Skyway. It ain't that bad and some people like it.

– Ted Rumsey

• • •

I'm with those who think tearing it down would be a huge mistake. Whether it's ugly or beautiful it works exactly as it was designed back in the 20th century. Wasting billions to fix what ain't broke based on 21st century hindsight to disfigure South Buffalo just to vaguely replicate what already exists is complete foolishness. This boondoggle includes seven new bridges and collateral damage to Tifft Nature Preserve. And for what? To liberate a few acres of waterfront for strictly seasonal recreation?

I agree with Stephanie Geter. If you're going to indulge in a boondoggle cover the Kensington Expressway and restore the Hamlin Park neighborhood. At least that added acreage would function 24/7 365 days a year.

I believe the Skyway should be preserved in some form not demolished with the utmost attention being paid to local environmentally fragile sites and preserving and supplementing them. In the past when driving through the city approaching the Skyway … provided a breathtaking contrast a panorama of Lake Erie and its Canadian shore which was always breathtaking in its scope.

As you can see I am in support of keeping part of the Skyway as part of a large hiking/biking/park preserving the glorious panorama it offers. Equally important is the restoration of areas like the First Ward in the process.

I've always been in favor of keeping that majestic sweeping wave of architecture that highlights our downtown corridor. I love Brian Higgins but he's wrong on this issue.

I've often thought that if we could add a piece of art on part of the span like a buffalo or a native canoe or something really creative that would bring attention to our city such as the St. Louis Arch or the Seattle Tower.

I would also like to see unique light stanchions running down both sides of the structure. Something to really draw attention to our revitalized downtown.

A perspective for those who want to remove the Skyway:

Stand on the patio of the Hatch at Erie Basin Marina and look up the Buffalo River as it flows south toward the Ohio Street lift bridge. There is the large grain elevator on the right and the graceful curve of Skyway joining it framing the postcard-worthy scene. Now imagine no Skyway: an empty expanse of sky and one less memorable Buffalo view.

Then there are the millions of pubic dollars to demolish it the millions more just spent to refurbish it and then millions more for Southtowns access to the city. It is one more foolish idea to remove an iconic Buffalo structure and waste tons of money.

I am against any efforts to tear down this “signature” highway. I have sentimental reasons … since my dad first took us to visit the family in Jamestown using this new route right after it was completed.

But sentiment is not the dominant motivation for my opinion.

I am tired of Buffalo’s knee-jerk decisions to tear down the past with no real concern for what is about to be destroyed and no real plan for what will replace it.

I challenge anyone to get in their car and take both drives (on the Thruway or Skyway).

One takes us first eastward through the back of suburbs with nary a naturally desirable view anywhere. Then we curve back westward and head into the city from behind. It’s a horrible bore.

The other takes us along the lake and then on a sweeping and beautiful rise it presents both our gorgeous Lake Erie (especially at sunset) to our left and the magnificence of the city ahead of us.

It is a breathtaking ride if one considers the sights around us. Taking the Thruway … we see nothing but Buffalo’s backside as we approach from the I-90 then the I-190. There is simply no comparison.

Again it is NOT about the extra time on the road…it is about the experience of the ride.

It just breaks my heart to think of losing another of Buffalo’s great assets.

– Peter Palmisano

• • •

I think tearing down existing structures which work well and are in good repair is wrong. At some point experts say in 15 years the Skyway will deteriorate beyond repair. Address it then.

For sure Humboldt Park was an asset unique to Buffalo and its loss was especially devastating to the surrounding neighborhood. Yet the expressway does provide necessary and convenient access to downtown for thousands every day. Removing it will not re-create the neighborhood nor will the Skyway's removal inspire development of a ""North End"" or ""Little Italy"" type atmosphere that has been romanticized. We aren't all certified villagers who scorn suburbia and embrace the riding of bicycles as a humanitarian act!

We need practical solutions to real problems. Deteriorating roads bridges sewers water lines are all major concerns as well as crime poverty lack of jobs and quality education.

One concern I have with removal is how it impacts the alternate routes such as the 190 South 90 South Park Abbott Road and Ohio Street. Skyway removal will have an impact on even those who don’t currently use it. On occasions when the Skyway is closed all of the other routes become heavily congested. Anyone who regularly uses the alternative routes should be just as concerned about impact on their daily commutes as those of us who live in the Southtowns.

A question I would like to see posed to planners is: Will the proposed alternatives be sufficient to handle all the displaced Skyway users in addition to the already existing traffic?

– Francis Norman

• • •

I say the Skyway should stay. Let Higgins and all these politicians come live in the Southtowns and see if they want to drive the extra 20 minutes it will take to get downtown. They will never convince me that their way will be better.

Here is a suggestion: Build the ""Southtowns connector"" before you take down the bridge.

Sean Kirst: A city of voices on the Skyway: 'The priority should be people' The subject of whether to keep or do away with the Skyway ignites fierce yes-or-no emotion in Western New York Kirst says.

I think the Skyway should go to open up our waterfront. The signature engineering landmark should be the peace bridge. The Mario Cuomo Bridge is a beautiful structure (where the Tappan Zee Bridge used to cross the Hudson) we need something like that here on our border. Take the Skyway down and make the border bridge a landmark.

I find it hard to believe that after the money that went into the last two years of repairs it just should be torn down. Second I am a member of the China Light Yacht Club next to RCR marina off Fuhrmann Boulevard. Since I live in Kenmore I had to take a roundabout way to get there while work was being done. It was a pain but something I could live with.

But what bothers me is if they tear it down will that put our club in a situation where we might lose it? Our property is right under the bridge. We have a good thing there with good people that love to sail and have put a lot of work into it. If it came down to that I'm definitely against the ""tear down."" Just my feeling.

The arguments for tearing the Skyway down keep changing.

Fifteen years ago the Skyway was said to be a physical barrier to development of the Canalside area “dividing” it as if the Skyway it were a solid wall instead of a high elevated roadway. It isn’t a wall of course and the site still feels quite open even as parcels within it are developed.

Lately we hear that the Skyway is inhibiting economic development by taking up valuable land. The ramps for instance are on land that ought to be covered with new buildings instead which would add to the city’s tax base. That argument is undercut by Douglas Jemal’s soon-to-be-built apartments which some have said will benefit from the cool urban vibe of being inside the Skyway’s looped highway ramp.

We have heard the Skyway is physically obsolete doesn’t meet modern engineering standards and that it sometimes has to be closed when the weather is bad. Well after the recent major repairs/maintenance it is set to go for a few more decades. And ANY road in Western New York sometimes has to be shut down briefly. Shall we remove I-90 between Buffalo and Westfield?

Some have said the Skyway is ugly; some say the opposite. I would guess there were those who in 1950 said Frank Lloyd Wright’s Larkin Administration Building was ugly. In retrospect was that a valid reason for tearing it down?

Meanwhile the Erie Canal is a piece of obsolete publicly funded infrastructure that once moved people and goods across the region. Today however the canal and its locks are revered enjoyed preserved. The popular new skating ponds at Canalside are basically a palimpsest of the canal’s Buffalo terminus.

So why are we vilifying the Skyway another piece of transportation infrastructure which divides no neighborhood is also a piece of Buffalo’s history and still serves a useful purpose?

I love everything about the Skyway. I love its name and it is a beautiful piece of art worth saving. Its sweeping curve gives drivers the most unobstructed beautiful view of Lake Erie. It would be shameful to change it at all. We also don’t need the resulting environmental destruction of the sanctuary that Times Beach and Tifft Nature Preserve offer the public and wildlife. Let the land stay quiet in this crazy time and focus on mending the horror of the Kensington and Scajaquada.

– Susan Gurney

The Skyway is the most efficient way for those in the Southtowns to get to Buffalo. Creating a boulevard is not a solution. Rarely do people drive 55 on the Skyway and to ask them to go 40 is beyond ridiculous. Increasing commuting time for taxpayers in the Southtowns is unjust. It’s been said it only adds 10 minutes … let’s assume that’s true and the lights are never out of sync – which we all know is extremely unlikely based on trips down Elmwood at rush hour.

That’s requiring the 46000 commuters that use the Skyway daily to spend an additional 83 hours a year in their cars – effectively nullifying their vacation time. I’ll leave it to others to make the very valid arguments regarding environmental and cost issues. If this was the best route for the wealthier areas north of Buffalo would we even be having this conversation?

– Laura Cabibi

• • •

It is difficult to believe anyone could think that Skyway traffic could be diverted to a 40 mile per hour boulevard through South Buffalo. It seems to me that those type of suggestions always come from people who don’t use the Skyway and don’t really realize the impact such a strategy would have on Southtowns commuters. You can’t divert rush hour traffic onto city streets without badly affecting thousands of people both in and south of the city.

– Richard Wachowiak

• • •

Yes I am ""biased"" in favor of not touching the Skyway because well I live in the Southtowns: Eden. I certainly suppose that anyone out there who has no ""need"" for something such as a Piper Cub couldn't care less about an airport! So I will even ignore that obvious point! (Except in one final statement.)

Therefore my sincere question would be: Where will all those vehicles go? I understand approximately forty thousand maybe more cars & trucks use that bridge into & out of Buffalo on a daily basis. You mean to tell me a parkway going off-route thru South Buffalo is going to adequately handle that traffic? Throw-in a 40 mph speed limit ... AWFUL plan!! Not to mention wrecking the natural habitat along the way or at least some of it – scarce as it is! The Skyway was built for a reason .... and that reason still exists today!

And now that Southtowns point. When it was completed my father worked at Greyhound in the shadow of City Hall on Court Street. When he first was able to jump on the new grand bridge we thought he had died and gone to Heaven!! He was sooooo happy ... Enough said.

KEEP THE SKYWAY

– Carl Modica

Proposals to tear down or close this iconic feature of Buffalo are boneheaded. My wife and I live in North Buffalo. Without the Skyway it would be a tedious energy-wasting stop-and-go drive through downtown to get to the Outer Harbor or anywhere else on Lake Erie. Look at REALLY LOOK AT Derek Gee's photo on the front page of the Buffalo News a few days ago:

That beautiful midcentury space-age structure with its late art deco piers wending its way through Buffalo's industrial landscape is a treasure providing one of the great pleasurable drives helping make Buffalo the city that prides itself on being able to get you anywhere within 20 minutes. It is not like the Scajaquada or Kensington expressways a mistaken-taking of parkland. It is a celebration of Buffalo's harbor and industrial heritage.

Why throw that away? Remember what a bad idea it was to tear down Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin Building? Let's not destroy Buffalo trying to turn it into someplace else.

– John Schimminger

There is a growing movement to SAVE THE SKYWAY because it is important to our transportation infrastructure. There are many other projects this money could be used for in our beautiful city. New York State just spent millions fixing the Skyway within the past few years. Why tear down a perfectly functional signature bridge? There are plenty of other projects that ought to be funded instead.

I live in the Erie Basin Marina; I use the Skyway often. It is so convenient to go to the Southtowns in less than 20 minutes. It will take a much longer commute to get to the Southtowns and people will think twice regarding going to restaurants and shopping in Hamburg. It will be much easier to just keep going north on the I-190. If you knock this down our city will be divided and many businesses potentially vulnerable ones will be hurt.

When the Skyway was closed for repairs in each direction a few years ago the traffic was terrible on the side roads. Tearing down the Skyway would make this temporary inconvenience a more permanent burden. Tearing down the Skyway is not the answer.

The views that we see coming in and leaving our city via the Skyway are beautiful and unique. Don't you want visitors to see a breathtaking view of our spectacular city? I know I do!

– Vicky Glamuzina

• • •

The Skyway is unique to Buffalo. Once gone it can't be replaced. It is not a barrier – I can walk under it! It provides shade at Canalside. I would like pedestrian access to get up high to view the city and the lake. Perhaps close it to traffic on weekends. We should wait to see if traffic patterns change after the pandemic. An at-grade highway is a barrier. We don't need another barrier to the waterfront. Concrete is bad for the environment.

– Carol Fortman

• • •

The Skyway should not be destroyed by land-greedy developers. This is the main reason why there is a private push to destroy a beautiful work that blends perfectly with the magnificent view of Lake Erie. How many trek to the Erie Basin Marina to view the lake even if it offers a limited view. Not many can afford the million-dollar housing along the waterfront shores built across the marina. Buffalo should not become a millionaire-row objective along our waterfront leaving Canalside a tiny crumb to be enjoyed by the majority of citizens.

– Patricia Butler

• • •

I want to save the Skyway. To me it is beautiful graceful and artistic. If looking at it from the ground at Canalside it is possible to orient yourself based on its support structure and it's curvature. It appears to ""hover"" in the air and yet I know that it is a safe and reliable roadway.

Over the last almost 50 years I have seldom worried about my husband's round trip into his Buffalo office from Hamburg. It's not just a safe and efficient way to get into the city but it is also free. That is a difference-maker for some people. Plus there is that view! Where else would we be able to embrace all that is Buffalo in a single turn of the head?

We need to have a conversation about it's future. A conversation is important. No one wants to feel as if they are being railroaded.

– Linda Priselac

• • •

“Enjoy the view from up top” would likely be a one-and-done visit. Planning for a future with climate change can’t involve people getting blown off the Skyway. WNY needs to stop making stupid thoughtless decisions. Take it down and restore what’s been broken.

– Beverly O’Connor

• • •

My take on the issue to the tune of “My Way” famously sung by Frank Sinatra.

I concur with Rachele Schneekloth of the ""Skyway Club"" and Frank Kowski – keep the Skyway open it up on summer Sundays for bikers and walkers appreciate its brutal elegance year round.

Let’s keep the Skyway

The plan that I most fear

And which could be the very worst thing

My friends I’ll say it here

If it comes down we’ll end up hurting

I’ve crossed it many times

I’ve fallen for this way-up highway

But let’s not lose our view

Let’s keep the Skyway

Regrets we’ll have a slew

Unless this gets our full attention

Let’s do what we must do

And not pave roads with good intention.

These plans to tear it down

Say that it’s just another byway

But let’s not lose our view

Let’s keep the Skyway

Yes in these times you sure could say

To take it down would clear the way

For brand new things to make us shout

About how nice to be without

That albatross we had to cross –

What was it called? Oh yeah – the Skyway

Our city almost died

We’ve had buzzkill our share of losing

But now let’s not deny

What is to come is of our choosing

To think we’ve got a chance

To proudly say it’s here to stay

And yes we’ll keep our view –

If we keep our Skyway

For what are we now what have we got

If not our past then we’ve got naught

To save the things we really prize

And show the world that we got wise

Let’s see it through let’s keep our view

Let’s keep the Skyway

– Mitch Flynn

• • •

I am a proponent of removing the Skyway and have to say keeping it because of the view is the weakest reason to keep it! While I think the CloudWalk idea is intriguing my idea is to remove it completely and build a tower like the Eiffel Tower which Tokyo did with Tokyo Tower in 1958 at a cost of $8.4 million which is $77 million in today’s dollars. And since the Eiffel Tower is named after the engineer who designed it I wouldn’t mind if it was called Jemal Tower or Pegula Tower ;)

– Dan Gigante

• • •

This goes along with the axiom ""if it ain't broke don't fix it.” The Skyway works perfectly well for our city. It is a glorious gateway into our city and beyond to our outer harbor and waterfront. It does not impede anything; it is functional and beautiful and necessary. Why are we even considering tearing it down?

Our state and city do not need to spend foolish money on something that would cost much more to replace than to keep and maintain. We just spent 50 million to rehab the Skyway. There is just no good reason to tear it down. There are many good reasons to KEEP the Skyway!!

Forty thousand commuters use it daily it links directly to our downtown and southern and northern suburbs; it provides beautiful vistas of our waterfront and easy access to it. It is a grand statement for our city. It does not impede any needed development in our great city. Please keep our Buffalo Skyway.

– Sally Ferrigno

• • •

I am opposed to removing the Skyway for many reasons the most significant being the resulting devastation to South Buffalo neighborhoods by the construction of a corridor to accommodate the nearly 10000 vehicles a day that will be rerouted through these city streets. Did we learn nothing from the disaster caused by the Kensington? The new 40 mph corridor will separate neighborhoods plummet property values and likely significantly increase traffic fatalities. Even the 198 has a speed limit of just 30 mph!

Further about 9 to 10 acres of wetlands will be destroyed by this venture. This is a fragile ecosystem that will be destroyed by the new roadway. What about the city’s Green Code? It seems the city gives variances like ""Tic Tacs"" and never follows its own zoning ordinances.

Finally the Skyway serves its purpose just fine as is and the astronomical cost to remove and replace the Skyway is outrageous.

– Linda Suchocki

• • •

Remember the Signature Bridge? The one that was supposed to replace the Peace Bridge? Look where that went. I don't believe for one minute that the alternative routes will accommodate the traffic and I don't believe for one second that the work to build the alternative routes will ever get done leaving a great big mess for the daily commuters. I've driven the alternative when I had to work at two years worth of Irish Festivals in late August and it was a cluster. Something will come up most likely environmental impact issues regarding the Tifft property that will drag this thing out forever.

With regards to the waterfront: Isn't there a great big expanse of waterfront property all along the lake south of the city? Why does it have to be right where the Skyway sits? Not nearly the same acreage as what exists just south of all this.

Lastly I lived the Urban Renewal debacle in the City of Tonawanda where my grandmother's restaurant was taken away from her by the powers that be along with a lot of other businesses and properties so a new and improved city could be built. Was it? Nope unless you count the Tops where the city incinerator used to sit and the strip plaza where the restaurant used to sit. She got almost nothing for the property after years of fighting the city.

My point is these things NEVER go according to plan and I don't see any of this coming to any sort of positive conclusion.

The Skyway is a magnificent structure with an amazing view and serves a very important purpose. I think it should be considered as part of a whole along with the 190. I can see maybe reconfiguring the interchange at the Buffalo end in order to free up some property but to get rid of the bridge in its entirety? For what reason?

– Bill Richau

• • •

The Skyway as a part of Buffalo’s waterfront is integral to the appeal and beauty of the city. It’s as iconic as the waterfront itself.

– Ed Lesniak Jr.

• • •

Keep the Skyway! Tearing it down would destroy Canalside and the Outer Harbor recreational areas. It took so long for Buffalo to utilize its beautiful waterfront and dismantling the Skyway would only facilitate unwanted high rise buildings. It is a needless waste of money that politicians seem so anxious to use even if it’s not needed …. such as the Metro or the unneeded roundabouts! Have to grab free money: spend it returning Humboldt Parkway to a parkway again!

– Peg Crane

• • •

I cannot see any reason for removing the Skyway. It was repaired about two years ago. It makes our city unique! Is there any logical reason for removing it? I wish someone would answer that question. I have not seen any politician or anyone for that matter give a good reason for removing it. And the one-half billion dollars proposed for the project is a major slap in the face to thousands of Western New Yorkers.

Just imagine how much good that could do for our city and area! And also that ""cloud"" suggestion for leaving one half of the Skyway in place is the biggest joke! Who thinks of these things anyway?

– Claudia O'Dee

Let me begin by saying I am a pontist. A lover of bridges. All bridges. I have lived my whole life in the good old 716 and traversed the Skyway in all seasons and at all times of the day and night. Regardless if I am heading into the city or back to the suburbs I find delight in the view offered to me by my bridge.

When heading downtown I never tire of the sight of the beautiful church spires the resolute profile of City Hall and the concrete monoliths called grain elevators that supported my ancestors who left Ireland to make Buffalo their home.

Often these days I return from the city and head south with one of my grandsons. His name is Jack Gerken and at the tender age of 4 he makes some astute observations. As we begin our ascent he announces we are climbing the Skyway. There is always a thrill in his voice at his first glimpse of water and he tells me; ""There it is Nanni! Our Ocean! Lake Erie!"" The weather determines if our discussion will be of men fishing or ice or boats or waves crashing the breakwall. The time of day will have us discussing morning fog or sunsets and moon glow.

Bridges join and connect. They span obstacles and they provide a path so we can make our way more easily. I do not know how they are built. I don't understand the physics of compression force or how to channel a load. I am a traveler that appreciates what a bridge offers whether it is a view or a memory or just the beauty of the bridge itself.

I realize my obsession with this particular bridge is sentimental. I would be sad to see the Skyway go. I am a lover of bridges. And so is Jack.

– Kathleen Gerken

• • •

We have traveled the Skyway extensively as we have relatives that live in the Hamburg area and mention to each other how beautiful the scenery is no matter the time of year. For us coming from Niagara Falls it is convenient and quicker for us to use the Skyway.

The time spent on this issue should be redirected to matters of more importance such as opening the Canadian border so families that have been separated for over a year may be be reunited!

– Sam and Carolee Messina

• • •

I support keeping the Skyway. Why? Let me count the ways …

It works.

It affords drivers and riders majestic views on every trip.

It has architectural and functional beauty.

I live in Lake View and can drive to Buffalo easily and quickly.

The alternative routes used during the recent Skyway repair were a nightmare congested long delays poor signage and more.

We just spent a ton of money to fix up the Skyway and it’s now a dream drive.

The Skyway is Buffalo past and present. It’s iconic.

Would these would-be “talent strategists” be in favor of removing the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge because they are “pulling us backward?” I’d hate to see these guys go to Europe.

We can’t afford to demolish the Skyway. It’s like our historic majestic grain elevators.

If you want ugly go for that half-Skyway destination nowhere.

– Leona Rockwood

• • •

Great article on Skyway and Humboldt Parkway. This pandemic is teaching us to slow down and appreciate what we have. Buffalo has the beauty of Olmsted’s parkways and an engineering marvel the Skyway.

Let’s make Humboldt Parkway again. Most would not mind a little longer commute to be driving down a beautiful tree-lined boulevard. It would be really nice to run out of Delaware Park down Humboldt Parkway and end up at Martin Luther King Park.

The Skyway is beautiful and functional. Why change it?

– Tom Steffan

• • •

The Skyway is a historical part of Buffalo as well as beautiful and breathtaking. Removing it would be disrespectful to the innovative people who designed and created this work of art. Buffalo has demolished too many pieces of history already.

Removal would also be detrimental to the thousands of Southtowns commuters who use it on a daily basis; the alternate routes suggested to handle both car and truck traffic would quickly be overwhelmed. The neighborhoods around these routes would also suffer. Instead of providing easy access to Buffalo the alternate routes could deter travelers.

I drove daily on the Skyway and enjoyed the experience and the view. There is nothing to match the smell of baking Cheerios in the morning to put you in a good mood. Let's not sacrifice a unique part of Buffalo.

– Barbara Ozark

• • •

From a distance the Skyway is a beautiful structure. Rather than complete removal I very much favor the CloudWalk which preserves the sweeping curve for viewing and recreation purposes with substantial cost saving by only removing the downtown portion that negatively impacts Canalside and preventing the wasting of the money recently spent repairing it.

Having said that I believe the first priority for the city would be rerouting I-190 where it cuts off several miles of river waterfront from the city. Riverside would truly be Riverside again public access to the river restored and undoubtedly new development would substantially increase city tax revenue.

– F. James Ginnane

• • •

That is a spectacular view from the Skyway in a car. And the view is so easy to access.

Drive down the road and ENJOY THE VIEW. No better view in Buffalo. MY neighborhood has few trees and I stare at buildings most of day. The view from the Skyway on a daily basis is my antidepressant. How will we apologize to future generations of Buffalonians that we lost the billion-dollar view to development?

Save Skyway from the developers ... A CloudWalk is not enough. If we ever had to build the Skyway in today’s world it would never get done because of the high cost.

Buffalo has very few beautiful views as that from the Skyway.

– Mark Tederous

• • •

I find it stunning that there is any discussion regarding spending $600 million for tearing down the Skyway a perfectly good bridge that offers the most beautiful views of any road in New York State. A complete waste of government funds when Western New York’s other roads and bridges are crumbling and many neighborhoods need investment.

I would however favor restoring the Parkway and replacing the Scajaquada Expressway that ruined a nice neighborhood.

– Thomas Metzen

• • •

The Skyway should stay as is; it is the best way for residents of the Southtowns to get into downtown for workers and sports venues and for dining and the most important Shea's. We have a subway that goes nowhere and the loss of driving on Main Street killed all of the businesses to make it a ghost town. My other thought about making it a observation deck: Climbing all those stairs will be difficult for the elderly and once you've seen it the thrill is gone.

– Dan Badaszewski

• • •

My opinion: Let it be!

I have not heard of a valid reason for a tear-down! Let's make the Skyway a Buffalo nighttime attraction with rope lights all the colors of the rainbow stretching the whole span on the outside of the top guard railings.

– Peter Hurtubise

• • •

Keep the Skyway. Why are politicians constantly trying to change things without first asking their constituents (the people) what THEY want?

– Sandra Empl

• • •

The Skyway should be left alone. Recently millions of dollars have been spent on it for repairs. It is a major arterial for Southtowns commuters; tearing it down would cause a nightmare for people trying to get to the city. The old adage applies: ""If it ain't broke don't fix it!""

– Marcia Amadori Crosby

• • •

Unless it is in danger of collapsing keep the Skyway and use those federal funds for other projects to continue the resurgence of Buffalo. Whether entering or leaving downtown the Skyway offers one of the best views in WNY. Add some ribbon lighting to enhance its nighttime appearance (the old Peace Bridge sure looks nice at night). Think outside the box by adding a zip line along the edge the whole length of the Skyway: A nice summer attraction like they have in Niagara Falls Ont.

– Wayne Zielinski

• • •

The plan for the demolition is very ill-conceived. It takes no account of the intrinsic value of tourism in Buffalo nor how residents of the area view the bridge.

We moved to Orchard Park in 1998 and I worked in downtown Buffalo for those years. Most every drive to work I made was over the Skyway. Seeing the breadth of the lake as well as the surrounding area each morning and evening gave me great peace as well as awe at this architectural marvel that allowed such a view. Imagine what a first-timer to the area feels!

We moved to Florida in 2004 but returned to Orchard Park this past September. I looked forward to once more driving the Skyway and again the same feelings returned. To hear of plans to dismantle this gem is extremely sad to me. Why build a 40 mph thoroughfare through South Buffalo? We already have one in place and it is magnificent.

– Darlene Kane

• • •

I live in Eden. I am definitely opposed to tearing down the Skyway. Doing that would make commuting from the Southtowns the nightmare it was before the Skyway was built. The Skyway harms no neighborhoods and provides a stunning view of the lakefront. It is definitely an asset for Buffalo.

I was born and raised in Chicago where the lakefront has been protected with no commercial development. Buffalo is finally getting better at that. Don’t reverse the progress that has been made by tearing down the Skyway. I am old enough to remember Humboldt Parkway and the beautiful neighborhood that it was. The Kensington was definitely a mistake that needs to be corrected.

– Joan Staby

• • •

Brian Higgins among others has declared the Skyway to be “structurally obsolete.” What exactly does this mean? I am a retired structural engineer and I feel that it might be referring to the metallurgical fatigue life of the steel girders but I have never read any authentic explanation. Can you find out what the Department of Transportation's opinion of the life expectancy is for the steel structure? That may be the nail in the coffin everyone is looking for.

– Peter Grace

• • •

There are some that are opposed to the Skyway being transformed. I am not one of those. What a marvelous idea to provide access to the fantastic views that the bridge has to offer by turning it into a pedestrian walkway with green space shops and restaurants. It allows all neighborhood communities to enjoy a view they currently may not have. It would join neighborhoods the same way as reverting the Kensington Expressway back into a parkway.

I am all for moving forward and can see the vision presented. I was a child of the ’70s and came down to the Elmwood area on my 18th birthday and saw the potential of this now marvelous neighborhood. Let’s not make this decision take 43 years to come to fruition.

– Bill Lovern

• • •

For 20 years I lived in Derby and worked downtown. Took the Skyway thousands of times. One late summer day when leaving work on the outbound Skyway two bikers with out of state plates were right in front of me. At the top of the Skyway one of them takes both hands off his bike and spread his arms out in front of him. I initially thought “great place to show off clown” but then realized this was his physical manifestation of awe in seeing (probably for the first time) beautiful Lake Erie open up in front of him as he crested the Skyway.

It reminded me that the view which I had taken for granted having seen it every day for years is awe-inspiring – especially if you’ve never seen it before. Would be a shame to lose it.

– Gregory P. Krull

• • •

It works! Besides being one of the most beautiful drives in the area most important it does the job of moving traffic out of the city to the Southtowns and beyond. What will be the alternative? No one seems to be giving us a clear answer to that. What will work better? A parkway? We were told it would only add five minutes to the drive. What a joke!

Can't help to believe that it's a political decision. Gee why would I think that? Leave the Skyway alone!

– Pat Arendt

• • •

When it comes to the Skyway I support the CloudWalk proposal. This visionary plan deserves close scrutiny. Retaining the portion of the iconic Skyway from the KeyBank Center to the Outer Harbor would also address serious concerns that precious and essential wetlands not be harmed.

As for Higgins’ and Kennedy’s support for a reduced speed at-grade parkway – good luck with that. Motorists refuse to abide by the reduced speed limit now on Route 198. It is not working. Speeding at-grade on a “boulevard” would be even worse.

We need to rethink our car-centric mentality. We need active transportation systems – biking walking hiking sightseeing wheelchair-rolling stroller-pushing public-friendly pathways that are environmentally and socially just. We can think big and reimagine on a large scale. Give the CloudWalk due consideration. Retain a part of the Skyway and make it accessible for PEOPLE.

– Sharon Murphy

• • •

Just read your article on the Skyway. I say keep all or part of it as a “CloudWalk.” It would enhance Canalside and the Outer Harbor.

– Bill Lickfield

• • •

Yes! Finally people arguing to keep the Skyway. Now that it’s a point of pride for pols determined to remove it they will never back down. But consider: Many of us who use it as a scenic commute to the Southtowns will never have that beautiful view of the city again! Use it! Picture an elevated bike path zip lines stairways and observation decks on the tallest supports. Put the money where it should go – removing or burying Route 33.

– Tony Duggan

• • •

The Skyway – Tear it down. Fill in the Kensington. Remove the Thruway. Close the Airport. Unplug the internet. Return to the halcyon days of horse and buggy.

OR

Recognize that change always marches forward. Utilize the massive infrastructure proposal to build what can be not what once was. Embrace the future in a way that 50 years forward next generations marvel at what was created when we had the opportunity.

This message was generated and sent on technology once not even imagined – but sure a carrier pigeon would get the job done...

– Michael Chavanne

• • •

This is the first time ever I have had input on anything in Western New York. I’m 55 and have lived in North Buffalo or Kenmore my whole life. Taking down the Skyway is a big mistake. It's an easy way to the Southtowns and Outer Harbor. It’s already there – build around it! Any other roads built will ruin those neighborhoods they pass through; a 40 mph road to get south will become a speed trap; look at 198 now. No one drives 30 on there and if you do you are in the way.

I also hate how many think the bridge should be used as a viewing point; doesn't that defeat the purpose of taking it down? Build a separate walking path and attach it to the Skyway if that’s what we want – much cheaper. But keep in mind it will become a suicide jump for people unfortunately.

– Tom Foley

• • •

A functional highway in and out of downtown. Breathtaking views. A living component to Canalside. A modern component to Old Buffalo.

Taking it down and rerouting traffic will harm Times Beach and Tifft Nature Preserve.

CloudWalk will only be for a relatively few people. All can drive or ride the Skyway.

– Miriam Haefner

• • •

The Skyway should stay for all of the reasons described by the advocates cited in your article. It is a fine example of period transportation infrastructure that happens to be beautiful especially where it towers over Canalside and gracefully sweeps to the south. I’d hate to lose that view from the ground.

It is also a remarkably democratic vantage point for a gorgeous bird's-eye view of Lake Erie that is otherwise enjoyed solely by office workers and wealthy renters or condo owners in downtown Buffalo’s taller buildings.

We already miss the real Father Baker Bridge. Remove the Skyway in furtherance of yet another odd attempt to reduce architectural density and suburbanize the urban environment and we will regret the loss.

Not to mention the traffic problems that would result from losing the Skyway and the effect that might have on downtown business.

If we are faced with an either/or proposition between restoring Humboldt Parkway to its original surface-level design or leveling the Skyway the choice is even easier: restore Humboldt Parkway; remove the gash that divides a beautiful historic residential neighborhood and keep the Skyway in the sky.

– Mike Reville

• • •

The commute without the Skyway will DEFINITELY take longer. The view of Lake Erie is unmatched from anywhere else. Take a video of the ride overlooking the lake from the Skyway and then take the same video of the ride at ground level. At the round level ride all you will see is the view of the breakwall.

The Skyway’s view is a great first impression for anyone traveling into Buffalo and leaves one with a warm lasting memory when traveling out. It is a great asset to Buffalo not a hindrance to the city.

– Tim Walsh

• • •

Just read your article and admit to being persuaded by previous arguments to remove it but after reading about the environmental impact of moving it and the idea of opening it to walkers and cyclists I’m against replacing it. I think the money would be better spent on neighborhoods ripped apart by Route 198 and Route 33.

It just makes more sense to leave something so unique and beautiful. I’m excited that our country is going to finally invest in infrastructure projects that will improve our quality of life. I think removing lead pipes to ensure safe drinking water and rebuilding decimated neighborhoods is a far better way to spend money than taking down a scenic skyway.

– Sue Tomkins

• • •

The Skyway has always been a joy for me to travel sometimes in a car sometimes on a motorcycle. As the driver of both it was a fun easy ride. As a passenger I delighted in the spectacular views of ... everything! The water the boats the ships being unloaded at the massive grain elevators (what do they do with all that sand?) the sunsets SIGH.

Did I stress a little when the Skyway was closed and an alternate winter route home needs to be used? YES! But I’m a Southtowns gal and winter challenges are acknowledged dealt with then forgotten.

Please do not discard this fabulous piece of history. At least let part of it become a viewing point for us to walk pause and remember.

Thank you for the opportunity to offer an opinion. Tho’ a kid at the time I remember the devastating building of the Kensington Expressway and continue to mourn the loss of the Parkway and all those beautiful trees.

In Interstate 81 decision signals on the Skyway's future? Syracuse announcement adds fuel to already intense debate in Buffalo about the nature function and consequences of the Scajaquada and Kensington expressways and more immediately the Skyway.

I recently moved to the Seneca One apartments after 59 years of suburban and small city living (Lockport and Hamburg). I have a bird's-eye view of the Skyway Canalside Lake Erie and more.

My vote is to take down the Skyway. I understand why some would prefer to keep it but I feel the long-term pros of removal outweigh the cons. If we're going to spend time money and effort in developing the Canalside and downtown area one of the biggest improvements to be made is removing those ugly highway supports that degrade the entire area down there.

My daily view – and yes many people live down here and more are coming.

For the cost of removing it we could probably pave every road in the city of Buffalo which would be a much better use of the money. We just spent (millions) to refurbish the structure and it’s good for several decades. We have a lot more pressing infrastructure issues to solve than removing this bridge just because it’s become some sort of hobby horse for a segment of the area’s population.

It’s not about efficient transportation but politics and ideology. The impacted minority should have a conversation with the power brokers. Wouldn’t it be pretty to think so.

Not only is the Skyway beautiful and iconic but it is efficient and much appreciated by Southtowns residents especially after experiencing the surface road delays and rush-hour nightmares during its repairs and upgrades in recent years.

The Skyway is to the Southtowns what Routes 290 990 and 400 are to the north and east suburbs of Buffalo. Propose abolishing those routes to those residents and commuters and they might see it our way.

Rip it down!

The Skyway should NEVER be made into a trail. We don’t need more trails! Trails ruin neighborhoods.

Beautify the waterfront … take down the Skyway.

Stephanie Geter is spot on. It was white privilege that decimated the Humboldt neighborhood so that those in the white suburbs could get to work faster. Parks definitely are important but people are way more important and deserve our first consideration. And taking down the Skyway is a solution looking for a problem.

I have lived in the Buffalo area for my 51 years. I have worked and attended events in the city and lived in the Southtowns (Hamburg and Orchard Park) for 38 of those years and used the Skyway as my main artery for travel to and from work and events. Normal long-term average commute for this ride is 22-35 minutes.

My suggestions are to improve the safety and reliability of the Skyway by considering the following:

• Add a cantilevered bike/walking trail along the lake side. This would turn an old roadway into a signature piece for the city.

• We could have events like the Skyway marathon or the Skyway Bike Race – any time we want.

• People would walk the route just to see the city and the lake from that vantage point. Days like the Fourth of July and during concerts at Canalside it would likely be packed.

• Add a cover to the skyway (potentially including the walkway) to eliminate or reduce future maintenance costs.

For storm events or after large sporting events and in the case of emergencies requiring evacuation of the city consider using all four lanes for outbound traffic. The more this option was utilized the better it would be in emergency situations. People would expect it and variable signage (electric signs that could be controlled remotely) would make this a simple transition like the Peace Bridge.

I think driving on the Skyway and glimpsing the beautiful Niagara River is a breathtaking view and one of the unique highlights (to me) of living in Buffalo. I think more focus should be placed on what is underneath the Skyway … and the idea to ""cut away"" part of the Skyway is not the way to go either … not only will it look stupid but who could utilize it? Only fit bicyclists and walkers … not small children older adults and/or those who have disabilities.

There is so much derelict land and building on the lower East Side – regenerate that area stay away from building (and ruining) the waterfront and Skyway; already too much commercial development is taking place down in that area.

– Kate Soudant

• • •

I have lived in Buffalo all my life the past 30 years in the heart of downtown. In my humble opinion the Skyway should stay because first of all they just put millions of dollars repairing it but most of all because it is a major thoroughfare from downtown to the Southtowns. It’s not only a beautiful view to appreciate the lake and boats enjoying it in the summer but all the ice in the winter months.

– John Gerling

• • •

I grew up in South Buffalo and remember the scary rides across the Skyway no matter which way one was going and believe it is a true icon of the city. You knew a snowstorm was going to be bad when the Buffalo Police Department would close the entrance to it at the foot of downtown.

It gives the city character and if it needed to be removed it should have been done years ago. I have not lived in Buffalo in 40 years but it will always be home and someday I will retire there and hope to see the Skyway still standing so I can take one of scary car rides across it one more time.

– Christopher Jones

It's easy for people that don't use the Skyway daily to say ""tear it down!"" It will be a nightmare for us Southtowners. I can't imagine the vocal opposition if the issue was tearing out the river section of the I-190. Really that section from Tonawanda all the way to Route 5 would be a better candidate for removal. But NO! Thousands of Northtowners use it daily. We can't do that. It would cause too much traffic on Niagara Elmwood etc. Brian Higgins does not care about our commute. Talk about forgetting where you came from. The Washington elite …

Post-Skyway proposal borrows from Buffalo's past to design its future The plan calls for re-creating the historic Canal District by bringing back a neighborhood with small-scale apartments and other structures.

• • •

I am a longtime Hamburg resident who supports the removal of the Skyway but opposes the proposed 40 mph boulevard. There is no reason for this highway to be downgraded to a boulevard because it is slated to run along a former rail corridor and though a heavily industrialized area. There are no recreational opportunities in this corridor but there are plenty along the waterfront.

It may be the case that the expressway alternative is more expensive but I believe this would be the preferred option among area residents whether they live in the Southtowns or in the city and Northtowns. Therefore I would support the 55 mph proposal as it maintains the current level of service without slowdowns.

Want something that is an example of modern engineering? Replace the Skyway and add Metrorail to it:

From the foot of the Skyway in Buffalo to the Lackawanna city line is a 4.13 mile x 400 ft wide Skyway/Elevated Rt. 5/Fuhrman Blvd stretch that cannot be developed in any manner. That is just about 200 acres off the tax rolls. Suburban commuters drive all the way up to Ridge Road in Lackawanna enduring 45 mph traffic and stoplights. They do not need an expressway the final 4.13 miles into downtown. Time to do what is best for Buffalo and not the rush-in rush-out commuter who made a personal choice to live where they do.

– Mike Wrona

Most important what is needed is a good Southtowns connector! Everything else Higgins Cuomo Kennedy and others propose is sleight of hand and a distraction to what is needed. These elected prestidigitators would have you believe a half-torn down bridge to be the eighth wonder of the world. They point out that the Skyway has to close three or four times a year whereas a 130-foot high observation deck would only close once a year (from September to May).

Think about it: How often would you go up there? How often do us locals visit Niagara Falls or any ""destination"" within a 100-mile radius?

Maybe if they want to improve traffic flow out of downtown they could use the railroad right of ways stretching out both south and east of the city.

Call me easy but not much beats the cheap thrill of a ride on the Skyway. Any time of day any time of year the bird's eye view of the waterfront and downtown Buffalo always delivers a supreme rush.

My Skyway travels conjure golden memories of being perched atop the late beloved Comet coaster in its Crystal Beach heyday. In that split second between ascent and descent you get one chance to take it all in. That view only ever available at that one time in that one place a moment to savor for a lifetime.

Oh and we can experience that every day for free? Yes we must tear that down!

If providing that thrill was its only function the Skyway could never be functionally obsolete. Happily the Skyway also functions to efficiently deliver thousands of people daily from the Outer Harbor to Buffalo and back.

Last year I attended a public showing of Skyway alternatives. Honestly it seemed to me that options focused on the forgone conclusion the Skyway will be replaced. Unacceptable.

Like the Comet the loss of the Skyway would be much lamented by this cheap-thrill seeker.

I am a retired process engineer who has been trying to get the Skyway removed for over 25 years. About three years ago I spoke at a meeting of the Greater Buffalo Niagara Regional Transportation Council about the need to find a feasible alternative to the Skyway before removing it.

Since the Department of Transportation couldn’t find a feasible plan I gave them one. My plan headed inland at Tifft Street headed north behind Tifft Nature Preserve crossed the railroad tracks near the water tower then crossed the river just east of the railroad bridge. It passed under the South Park bridge and tied into the I-190 at the Hamburg Street interchange.

Many months later public presentations were held supposedly 28 possible suggestions were evaluated (mine NOT included). I recall that the current DOT plan appeared already favored as it was presented on its own individual poster; all the others were grouped onto two more posters. No public discussion was allowed.

Fast forward to April 2 when The News published the revised plan. Earlier the DOT had suggested “two” alternatives of the same route a path to the Tesla plant’s back door. I think they are required to give the public more than one choice. The “boulevard” option was now selected (mainly because an expressway wasn’t really possible due to lack of room for ramps at the Tesla plant and in South Buffalo).

The goal of “helping to eliminate commercial traffic problems in the RiverBend area” had been added to the goals of removing the Skyway and finding a feasible alternative. Since 95% of the morning traffic heads to either the 190 N Delaware or the Elm/Oak arterial the connection to the 190 should be as close to downtown as possible. The Path to Tesla ties into the 190 two miles east of Hamburg Street!

There already exists good connections to the 190 via South Park to Smith Street or Lee to Elk to Smith Street for the Tesla plant. The DOT plan is therefore just a way to use Skyway removal as an excuse to get a quick connection to Route 5 west. Note here that about five hundred FEET of road would connect Abby Street to Rittling Boulevard and hence to Tifft and Route 5. The excuse I got from the regional DOT director was that that neighborhood east of Abby Street would get too much noise. In that case let Elon Musk (net worth increased by $150 billion in the past year) build his own private road (about 2500 feet) west of Abby Street to connect up to Rittling Boulevard.

Other than a lift bridge over the Buffalo River (an almost exact replica of what would be needed was built over the Genesee River in 2004 at a cost of $80 million including the approaches) there are no special requirements for my plan. It is cheaper (cost maybe $300 million versus $550 million) faster and much simpler than the DOT plan. If the RR’s cooperate the South Park Bridge would require little or no modifications. The 190 bridge would require none. The plan would be for a four-lane 50 mph expressway with shoulders and a bike path from the South Park bridge all the way to the Outer Harbor.

The current DOT plan would be another HUGE infrastructure mistake.

– Jim Rudnicki

• • •

As a Southtowns resident who travels Route 5 into the city I strongly feel the Skyway should be left alone! Once a new four-lane roadway is built to replace it – then and only then – they can remove it but not any sooner!

Millions of dollars were just spent on repair. Why is everyone in such a hurry to tear it down?

– David Leising

• • •

This is Buffalo's only chance to actually have a ""signature span"" since the new Niagara River bridge was killed due to environmental concerns.

From my casual observation Brian Higgins seems to be the only advocate for removal of the Skyway. Can't we find other projects to keep him busy?

– Jon Louis Wilson

• • •

I am opposed to the tearing down of the Buffalo Skyway for the same reasons that Jay Burney of the Times Beach Nature Preserve has expressed:

""Vehicular alternatives to the Skyway as presented now will harm precious wetlands put environmental stress on the fragile Tifft Nature Preserve and lead to new construction injurious to the ‘critical ecological resource' at the Outer Harbor."" I would also add subjectively that it would harm the Outer Harbor Bicycle Trail.

– Rev. Howard Warner III

Absent from the decision-making process is geographic pressure. In other communities that removed highway barriers there was neighborhood pressure to connect the neighborhood to the resource on the other side. What is on the ""other side"" of the Skyway? A very small piece of land that supports a very large sailboat marina and a sand dock then the Buffalo River and a landscape of industrial uses or postindustrial uses and various downtown institutions. Hardly a residential neighborhood in sight until you get to the other side of the Buffalo River.

The transportation service provided by the Skyway in its current configuration far outweighs any upside to its removal in the hope that it will finally allow the kind of popular geographic the removal proponents believe in. Does the removal plan include the relocation of the marina (to where?) and the development of an exclusive strip of waterfront townhomes and condos? Again the trade-off comes at a great expense without much ""access"" benefit to the public median. But maybe that is the objective: What can we do to support the growth of the affluent white-collar population in the city of Buffalo?

Set aside for the moment that for all of us from Chautauqua County and the Southtowns it’s the easiest most direct route to downtown Buffalo. More importantly it is the one roadway that allows one to see and answer the whys about Buffalo and WNY.

With out-of-town visitors I always take the Skyway. Where else can you see that the city sits at the nexus of one of the Great Lakes and the river connection to the last of the Great Lakes in the chain?

If you know your history you can visualize why the area was settled and fought over with our now-closest friends on the other side of the water. Driving south one captures the magnificent view of the rounded curvature of Lake Erie as its stretch eastward ends; the hills to the south; cottage lands running southwest along the shore.

And down below the industrial remnants of what was once a vibrant economic engine; steel plants along the shore; grain mills along canals; a working port. There is no other structure so evocative of the history.

Like most commuters from the Southtowns we love the Skyway and had to suffer when going downtown after 9 a.m. when they repaired it. We were Rep. Higgins supporters but can no longer complain to him because he no longer represents the Southtowns. If he did I believe his position might be different. We also believe the money would be better spent in the city and not wasted tearing down our recently rebuilt Skyway.

'We've got to get it right': Boulevard option gains favor as Skyway review moves ahead The boulevard plan calls for at-grade and elevated roads seven new bridges and the removal of three bridges along a 2.6-mile stretch from Route 5/Tifft Street to a new on-ramp at Seneca Street.

• • •

I am vehemently opposed to removing the Skyway for the following reasons:

1. The Skyway has been a part of my life since my first job in downtown Buffalo in 1969. I travel it sometimes daily and the efficiency and beautiful views are breathtaking.

2. The Buffalo Skyway/Fuhrman Boulevard complex is an extremely efficient highway corridor that acts more like an Interstate Highway than an Urban Roadway. Everyday 22000 vehicles head north into the city of Buffalo and 22000 vehicles go out of the city towards points south.

3. New York State just spent $30 million dollars and two years of construction to rehab the bridge which will make it good for many years. If it isn’t broke don’t fix it!

4. Buffalo’s Lakeside Commerce Park continues to grow and to add many additional trucks that use this highway daily.

5. Town of Hamburg has recently approved the Amazon Warehouse Project just south of the Skyway which with the recently completed FedEx Project will generate considerable truck traffic.

6. While Congressman Higgins and Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation believe that by removing the Skyway they can open up development on the Outer Harbor many environmental groups oppose any development on the Outer Harbor as evidenced by the public outcry over the now abandoned Freezer Queen redevelopment project proposed by developer Gerald Buchheit (known as Queen City Landing).

7. As a young man I witnessed the landfilling and garbage disposal (burning) of acres of land on the Outer Harbor west of Fuhrman Boulevard. This land is contaminated and structurally unstable and thus not suitable for development.

8. Congressman Higgins is often quoted as saying the Skyway is “functionally obsolete and structurally deficient"" and that it could not be built by today’s standards. Ninety-five percent of all bridges in New York State could not be built under today’s standards.

9. Representatives of Tifft Nature Preserve and other environmental activists state that the proposed alignment for the relocated Route 5 adjacent to the Nature Preserve would have adverse environmental effects on it.

10. If anyone thinks that by pushing the existing traffic onto city streets (even with synchronized signalization) will help to revitalize those sections of the city they’re dreaming. Just look at the Hamlet of Woodlawn. No one stops there. People are trying to get from their homes to their jobs and back in the evenings ASAP!

11. Finally to pay for the design acquisition of right-of-way construction and add potential time delays when we have a perfectly good highway into the city is just ridiculous.

We've seen a few costly mistakes in my lifetime such as closing Main Street. Lately we've seen proposals to cut the Skyway in half and make it a ""CloudWalk"" to building a tunnel to putting the Comet on top.

I suggest we cover the Skyway with glass panels so to keep it open 365 days – 24/7. Just think – no plowing no salt no police to sit at either end when closed and no wind WIND blowing us from lane to lane.

""Save Our Skyway"" by building a Sky-Tube. Please let's not make another mistake.

Previous to the Skyway's opening reaching downtown Buffalo with its stores government and insurance offices was a 25-minute ride on a bus possible with traffic lights at Gate One of Bethlehem Steel Hanna Blast Furnaces the Union Ship Canal Bridge the Tifft Street traffic light the Ohio Street traffic lights the Ganson Street traffic light the Louisiana Street bridge with its hourly ship closures and more traffic lights in Buffalo. The 7-minute drive with the Skyway route was heaven. Whoever tears it down will be faced with shame forever.

I believe the Skyway is a beautiful curving piece of architecture. Stand at Canalside and look up and appreciate its beauty. I don't understand where the preservationists are when you need them.

I did not live in Buffalo when it was built but from knowledge in Rochester many of the ironworkers who worked on bridge projects were Native Americans. This is a tribute to their hard work and dedication.

The Skyway is not the ugly part. It is the 190 section by the waterfront. That section could be spruced up paved and even have artwork or murals to improve the appearance.

This route does not divide any neighborhoods and provides easy access for commuters from the Southtowns. I commuted it for 30 years. It was a safe efficient way to reach downtown.

I am vehemently opposed to getting rid of the Skyway. Let’s not make yet another mistake such as the location of the University of Buffalo and the Bills stadium – plus Routes 198 and 33 and closing Main Street to traffic to name a few!

The advantages of keeping the Skyway far outweigh the advantages of tearing it down. I usually agree with big thinking but not on this issue.

– Charlotte “Sunny” Davis

• • •

To the politicians and developers who want to remove the Skyway: Do NOT remove the Skyway.

This is the main thoroughfare for traffic (46000 and counting per day) to and from the city.

It is the fastest and most efficient way to move vehicles. As more and more projects and events are moved downtown the number of vehicles coming and going are only going to increase. Then the special events will create an even bigger logjam.

Trying to route traffic through side streets instead will cause increased pollution from residents as well as pedestrian injuries and death. There simply have been no viable alternatives offered. Then the costs – an estimated $500 million … $500 million! For something not only unnecessary but causing problems?

Use the money to improve infrastructure so when it rains sewage doesn’t flow into water – and clean up pollution that’s already there.

Politicians with no engineering background should never be involved with deciding road construction.

Politicians always lack details:

Before the Skyway can be removed the Niagara Thruway must be widened to accept increased traffic. a bridge over the Buffalo river must be built. This part is really out there.

Politicians always underestimate costs:

No right of way has been purchased. Cleanup of railroad property is in the mix.

Other Dreams: Channeling traffic through South Park and Seneca streets? Two-lane city streets with on-street parking?

Dumping traffic on Tifft Street after you ride on this new boulevard? Then where do you go? back to Route 5. Is Tifft going to be repaired? South Park and Seneca streets are a mess too.

Coordinating signals is another major expense.

Time to trash this idea and fix what you have.

I live in Eden. I am definitely opposed to tearing down the Skyway. Doing that would make commuting from the Southtowns the nightmare it was before the Skyway was built. The Skyway harms no neighborhoods and provides a stunning view of the lakefront. It is definitely an asset for Buffalo.

I was born and raised in Chicago where the lakefront has been protected with no commercial development. Buffalo is finally getting better at that. Don’t reverse the progress that has been made by tearing down the skyway. I am old enough to remember Humboldt Parkway and the beautiful neighborhood that it was. The Kensington was definitely a mistake that needs to be corrected.

I support keeping the Skyway. Why? Let me count the ways…

It works.

It affords drivers and riders majestic views on every trip.

It has architectural and functional beauty.

I live in Lake View and can drive to Buffalo easily and quickly.

The alternative routes used during the recent Skyway repair were a nightmare congested long delays poor signage and more.

We just spent a ton of $ to fix up the Skyway and it’s now a dream drive.

The Skyway is Buffalo past and present. It’s iconic.

Would these would be “talent strategists” be in favor of removing the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge because they are “pulling us backward?” I’d hate to see these guys go to Europe.

If you want ugly go for that half-Skyway destination nowhere.

AP Auto Writer

DETROIT — For the next few months Charlie Gilchrist figures his 11 car dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area will sell just about every new vehicle they can get from the factories — and at increased prices.

In normal times that would be cause for joy. Not so much now. A global shortage of computer chips has forced automakers to slash production. The result has been far fewer vehicles on dealer lots just as the waning pandemic has fueled a pent-up consumer demand for cars trucks and SUVs.

Given the robust customer demand dealers like Gilchrist could sell many more cars and trucks if only they had more. Even at elevated prices — the average new-vehicle sales price tops $40000 up nearly 10% in two years — customer demand exceeds supply.

""It's pretty evident when you pull onto our lots that there's not much selection"" said Gilchrist whose lots carry brands ranging from General Motors and Ford to Nissan and Volkswagen. ""Our (sales) volume is falling because of the sheer lack of inventory. It will still fall during the next two or three months.""

The across-the-board surge in auto prices contributed mightily to last month's jump in U.S. consumer prices the government reported Wednesday. A record 10% increase in used vehicle prices in fact accounted for roughly one-third of April's overall rise in consumer prices — the sharpest monthly increase in more than a decade.

Ford expects to produce only half its normal number of vehicles from now through June. GM and others have resorted to halting production of some cars and smaller SUVs and diverting computer chips to higher-profit pickup trucks and large SUVs. Leading automakers are warning of diminished earnings.

The vehicle scarcity and the soaring prices can be traced to the eruption of the coronavirus 14 months ago. As the virus spread auto factories shut down for a couple of months. With millions more people working from home demand for laptops and monitors led semiconductor makers to shift from autos to personal electronics. Soon though a faster-than-expected economic rebound boosted demand for vehicles and auto plants tried to restore full-scale production. Yet chip makers couldn't respond swiftly enough.

With production slowed dealer inventories shrank. Now as the chip shortage has persisted the shortage of new vehicles has worsened and analysts foresee no return to normal before next year.

Yet so far automakers have been earning big profits even with a depleted inventory largely because many buyers have been willing to pay more to get what they want. With government stimulus checks and tax refunds in hand Americans bought about 1.5 million new vehicles in April. That's an adjusted annual sales rate of 18.5 million — the highest such rate since 2005.

""It's like toilet paper was a year ago"" said Michelle Krebs executive analyst for Cox Automotive. ""Everyone is rushing to buy a car.""

Cox Automotive surveys suggest that 63% of potential buyers will stay in the market even with higher prices and a meager selection of vehicles. With new vehicles prices jumping the cost of popular vehicles has become eye-opening. The average price of a new Chevrolet Silverado pickup for example is now just under $51000.

Even so the supply of vehicles is dwindling. Last month the nation's total new-vehicle inventory plummeted 42% from a year ago to 1.9 million. That's enough to supply only 33 days of sales at the current pace — 88 days fewer than a year ago according to Cox. At the same time discounts fell 5% from March to April and 25% from a year ago to an average of $3239 per vehicle.

Jeremy Smith is seeing the price increases on both ends as he buys and sells pickup trucks for his utility trailer sales business near Buffalo New York. In March he bought a used diesel 2020 Chevy Silverado crew cab with 21000 miles on for $61000. Comparable trucks are now listed on websites he said for $68000 to $70000.

At the same time he's asking $13995 for a 2011 Silverado crew cab with 178000 miles on it a far higher price than he would have thought even a few months ago.

""You sell high you buy high"" said Smith who frequently buys trucks for his business. To get one now he says people have to move quickly to put in bids with dealers or owners.

""If you're not on it"" he said ""those things are gone.""

Given the lack of supply nearly everyone expects new vehicle sales to fall soon. That would mean fewer trade-ins which would further tighten a low supply of used vehicles. For consumers who can wait analysts say it might be wise to delay buying any vehicle until next year or even beyond.

An index that measures wholesale U.S. used vehicle prices from auction house Manheim soared 53% in April from a year ago hitting a record high. Auto dealers buy used vehicles at auctions; the average price there hit nearly $18000.

Dealers mark up wholesale prices when they sell to consumers. The average list price of a used car last month was just over $22000 14% higher than a year ago.

Dealers are now scrambling for used cars hoping to sell them to keep cash flowing through the summer as new vehicle supplies dry up. Richard Bazzy who runs four Ford and Lincoln dealerships in suburban Pittsburgh said he's formed a team to buy used vehicles.

""Every car dealer in the world is jamming the auctions right now trying to fill their shelves because of the lack of new-car inventory"" he said.

Bazzy said he's hopeful that his business will manage OK with used sales as well as revenue from parts and service. But he wants all the used cars they acquire now to be sold by August when he expects the inventory of vehicles to start a return to normal.

Cox's Krebs said it's hard to predict how long the chip shortage and tight supplies will last. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cautioned investors not to expect extremely high auto prices beyond the end of this year as new-vehicle supplies recover.

The pandemic and chip shortage have made rental cars scarcer too driving up prices dramatically and causing long waits as people start traveling again. Rental companies have had trouble getting new cars because auto companies have diverted vehicles away from fleet buyers to more profitable sales to consumers. Higher demand has sent some rental companies to the used car market to find vehicles.

Whenever the car shortage ends GM Ford and others say they will change business models away from having huge stocks. GM has considered regional distribution centers that could send vehicles to dealers in a matter of days. Ford's CEO Jim Farley has talked of quickly delivering on factory orders. Both companies hope to reduce the interest paid on high inventories and keep discounts low.

""I do think we are on the verge of possibly a different kind of paradigm for how vehicles are distributed"" Krebs said.

Still competition could thwart those plans once factories return to normal production.

Bazzy normally stocks 400-500 pickup trucks at his three Ford dealers but is down to around 100. He's confident that he can keep customers happy if they order a truck and can get it in four weeks. But he fears losing business to competing brands with a huge stock.

The automaker originally announced plans to construct the new racing engineering hub in the Charlotte region last January. Those plans materialized in the purchase of land and the construction of a large building in Concord. However the project was put on the backburner as the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation and the world. Shortly after in June 2020 the automaker’s GM Defense subsidiary was awarded a $214.3 million government contract to provide the U.S. Army with its Chevy Colorado-based Infantry Squad Vehicle. Rather than build a brand-new facility to manufacture the ISV the automaker decided to utilize the existing building it had constructed for the Chevy NASCAR racing center to produce the military truck.

Now the Chevy NASCAR program is looking to set up another new racing technical center in North Carolina Warren explained and the new facility will be even better than the one it had planned initially.

“Originally we purchased the [what is now the GM Defense plant in Concord] facility for our racing technical center and then with COVID and all the austerity measures we put it on pause” Warren told GM Authority executive editor Alex Luft. “The center was already purchased at this point. Then GM Defense business came up and it made a lot of sense to dedicate it to GMD. But there is still going to be a racing technical center just not at that facility.”

“There were some compromises with that facility too like there is only one door but at the time we were going to push really hard for it” he added. “With the location going to GM Defense that gave us time to go back and look at other areas and the new technical facility we’ll probably be announcing really soon. At one point in time we were going to have a groundbreaking on the new technical center the next day after the GM Defense announcement so we thought we’d give that some space.”

When GM initially announced the racing technical center last year it said the facility would allow it to expand and enhance factory support for Chevy NASCAR race teams as well as various other GM racing teams. The facility was set to contain high-tech driver-in-the-loop simulators vehicle simulation tools an aerodynamics development center and other tools designed to advance its racing and production capabilities. The new facility will likely feature the same equipment although GM is staying tight-lipped on details for the time being.

GM is eyeing a new racing tech center just as it prepares to start racing the new NASCAR Next Gen Chevy Camaro ZL1 from the 2022 season onward. The NASCAR Next Gen car is significantly more modern than the current Gen 6 car featuring carbon-composite body panels a sequential transmission larger wheels with centerlock hubs and larger ventilated disc brakes among other advanced tech.

Daily News Correspondent

It was 1986 and Jack Trabucco heard cries and whispers that the Framingham-based General Motors plant where he worked was closing. “I started looking for a job right away” Trabucco remembered. The next day he made a call.

He had been on the General Motors security staff for three years. “A Natick police officer told me that Wellesley College had an opening.” So he dropped a dime.

At the campus police station Bill Bowman answered the call. It would change their lives forever.

Trabucco interviewed for the job and got it. On March 8 2021 35 years later he retired.

Bowman is still on the campus beat 46 years and counting. Eighty-one years between the two! Bowman had taken up criminal justice at Northeastern. Through the school’s co-op plan he wound up with the police job at Wellesley College. “And I never left” he said. “I didn’t think this would be my life when I was 19.”

Bowman and Trabucco are both 66 years old. When they talked on the phone that first time there was a whiff of familiarity. Their last names resonated with each other. But why? What was the connection if any?

Then it clicked in. Turned out they had been high school basketball rivals Bowman at Framingham South Trabucco at Natick. They began reminiscing. Trabucco described the game when Bowman made the winning shot against Natick. Did Bowman remember? Oh yeah. “Three seconds left 16-footer” he said.

Author! Author!:'Places with spirit grit': Wellesley native gets the call up with hockey novel 'The Mighty Oak'

Any carryover competition between them quickly dissolved at Wellesley College. They wore uniforms badges and guns. They became partners charged to protect the well-being of the students first and foremost. They often went out on dispatch calls together.

It was fated that Bowman and Trabucco would become lifelong friends. They golfed skied and traveled to distant places together; they were in the stands on typically blustery raw Army-Navy December football games. They took family vacations together.

They haven’t slowed down much. Trabucco is inspired by a brief philosophy: “Life’s too short. Don’t forget how to have some fun every day.”

For Bowman fun isn’t guaranteed. Life’s vicissitudes have taken care of that.

Five years ago he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently COVID-19 also took a swipe at him. CLL shows up when abnormal B cells press against healthy ones. “I thought I had Lyme disease"" he said. ""I was at the Cape and felt sick as a dog.”

He returned home to Hopkinton didn’t feel better spent a couple of days at MetroWest Medical Center in Natick and was sent to Tufts Medical Center in Boston. “I had an immune thing going on” Bowman said. Even now he may need more treatments. There are other medical issues that nag him. He knows how to take a punch and how to counterpunch.

After his COVID-19 setback Bowman resumed his shifts at the college patrolling the 200-plus acres as if he were the healthiest guy around. No complaints. All smiles.

He and Trabucco never took the college’s natural beauty for granted. “It’s so well-kept so picturesque” said Trabucco. “When the flowers are in bloom it’s breathtaking. I thought the grass at Fenway Park was green!”

Bowman even took courses (they were free) at the college. “I’d be the only guy in the class me and 15 16 women.”

The reality is Bowman and Trabucco have been campus cops with big responsibilities at one of the country’s most prestigious women’s colleges. Calls to police dispatch put everything in motion. A student has taken a nasty fall; a larceny complaint in a dormitory. Alcohol abuse is problematic. Occasionally an ambulance is called to the scene. Binge drinking is not uncommon on any campus. “Especially with first-year students away from home for the first time” said Trabucco.

Weekend parties with men on campus can be troublesome Bowman pointed out.

“We’re a small group 10 or 12 officers and we’ve got 4000 people on campus. We want them to be comfortable calling the police” There are two women members on the force.

There have also been calls for animals in distress especially on Lake Waban part of the college’s charm. Usually in animal distress the town’s fire department gets called in to work with the campus police. “We’ve had a lot of dog rescues on the lake” said Trabucco. “They get roped back in.”

Some dogs swimming too far out have been killed by swans that feel their space has been invaded. Once a deer was rescued on a frozen Lake Waban. The deer’s hooves had stuck on the ice.

Before landing at Wellesley Trabucco had other ideas. “I planned on being a special ed teacher.” But a neighbor a Natick police officer Ted Kerrissey got him thinking about police work. “It seemed interesting. Ted had a big influence on me” said Trabucco.

Bowman was already at Wellesley when he was courted by the Framingham Police Department. “They wanted me to come in for an interview. I told them I was going to stay put.” He had settled in at Wellesley. Liked the job liked the people.

“The faculty here is second to none we all look out for each other” said Trabucco a terrific three-sport athlete and college scholarship football player. “We’re a community unto ourselves. It’s been a privilege working here.”

Wayland resident Kathy Hagerstrom has worked at the college for 30 years 18 as the basketball coach. She has eye-witnessed Bowman and Trabucco doing their jobs on numerous occasions. “They are student-centered and skilled communicators” she said. “Kind and caring. They would go out of their way to help above and beyond the demands and expectations of the job.

“Eighty-one years. Not certain we’ll ever see the likes of that again here.” Hagerstrom is currently assistant director at the college’s Keohane Sports Center.

Trabucco met his wife-to-be Carrie on campus. In fact she was his supervisor for a while having been a campus patrol officer and later sergeant. Their daughter Kelsey is a 2016 Wellesley grad. A son Sam graduated from MIT. The twice-married Bowman has four sons.

Ironically Trabucco and Bowman grew up just minutes from the Wellesley campus – “I could’ve walked there from Natick” said Trabucco – but neither had ever checked out the place not even a drive-through.

While their personalities may be dissimilar their friendship is boundless. Bowman calm and soft-spoken Trabucco high-spirited. Always. “Jack’s energy is contagious. He’s animated by life” said Bowman.

Clearly they share the same attitude that life should be lived to the max obstacles kicked out of the way. Bowman’s leukemia? “I don’t let that slow me down. I’m all Go! Go! Go! I don’t sit still.” His late father was like that. Bowman Sr. had been a member of the Cape Cod Ski Club. When he was 80 he had a hankering to ski again. So he and his son flew to Switzerland and flew down the slopes. Speaking of flying the younger Bowman learned to fly at the Marlborough Airport and earned a pilot’s license.

Bowman and Trabucco have long been at the stage when one starts a sentence and the other finishes it. They’ve divvied up life and nurtured plenty of common ground. It’s what friends do.

“And what a friendship it’s been” said Bowman. Good men good cops right place.

India's Cipla said on Saturday that its manufacturing of the COVID-19 remdesivir drug was beginning to catch up with demand after the company sought to boost production amid a massive second wave of coronavirus infections in the country.Backorders and complaints over low supply started moderating in the second week of May the drugmaker said after it began ramping up production of the antiviral drug last month.Hospitals have faced shortages of the drug which is being widely used and was sold in April for over 10 times its listed price in the black market.Cipla's production of remdesivir is currently 5 times higher than the monthly output of 200000 to 300000 vials seen in the last wave of the pandemic last year the company's Chief Financial Officer Kedar Upadhye told Reuters. Remdesivir was originally developed by U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc. Future supply of the drug will also depend on the course of the pandemic in India but ""manufacturing is no longer the bottleneck"" Upadhye said.The number of complaints about supply has dropped Upadhye said adding that Cipla was working with state governments to tackle ongoing supply shortages in parts of the country.Cipla one of India's oldest drug manufacturers has a deal to make and supply remdesivir to more than 100 countries. Several other Indian drug producers have similar agreements.The company has also signed licensing agreements with U.S. companies Merck and Eli Lilly to make and sell Merck's experimental COVID-19 drug molnupiravir and Lilly's arthritis drug baricitinib which is also being used to treat COVID-19 in India.On Friday Cipla reported a 68.1% jump in fourth-quarter consolidated net profit and a 6.6% rise in sales.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alessandro Bianchi | Reuters

Elon Musk is known for a brain that combines the capabilities of a rocket-science supercomputer and self-driving algorithm an ability to see the future that has paid off in one of the world's biggest billionaire fortunes and market's largest companies by being ahead of others in taking risks on going to Mars electric cars and long before that a first big idea finding and paying for things on the internet. But that doesn't mean that on bitcoin  which Musk bought for Tesla 's balance sheet earlier this year and profited from in the first quarter he is out ahead in a way that other executives should be following. He's been merely keeping pace with retail investors from the Robinhood trading crowd and companies like MicroStrategy and Square  which were invested in bitcoin on their balance sheets before Tesla. Now in citing the climate risks of bitcoin this past week as a reason to suspend the ability of Tesla customers to use the cryptocurrency as a payment method Musk was entering a debate over the climate implications of bitcoin that isn't news to anyone who has followed the market for years. To experts who advise corporations and to a growing group of chief financial officers Musk's back-and-forth on bitcoin does speak to real issues: Should more corporations be adding bitcoin to the balance sheet? Should they be staying away from bitcoin due to concerns including the energy consumption required to mine it contradicts growing ESG commitments to climate change? The answers: maybe ""no"" and ""no."" Starting with climate.

Climate corporations and crypto thinking

Martin Whittaker CEO of ESG market specialist JUST Capital which focuses on holding companies accountable on issues like carbon emissions said climate criticisms of bitcoin are easy to make but can be oversimplified. ""I've seen the numbers on the carbon footprint equal to Sweden or New Zealand and the truth is it depends on how the power is generated. ... If you mine it all from bituminous coal that's going to give you one level of carbon intensity but if it comes from clean power it is a totally different footprint. ... Cryptocurrency can be a big opportunity for anyone who cares about clean energy"" Whittaker said on a CNBC Global CFO Council virtual event this past Thursday. In Musk's defense his comments on the energy intensity of mining were also a call to action for the crypto industry to focus on creating efficient operations — maybe with more control over the market for himself. One recent tweet referred to the ""joke"" cryptocurrency dogecoin that Musk has promoted as having a future in which it ""wins hands down."" In any event the climate comments had leaders in the crypto space who have been involved for over a decade scratching their heads. ""I don't understand why he said that because I would expect him to understand how mining works"" said Wences Casares CEO of digital bank and bitcoin custodian Xapo speaking at the same CNBC CFO event and noting that the world already wastes tons of energy in no useful activity and bitcoin mining uses a roughly miniscule percentage of world energy and much of its operations already are renewable. Roughly three-quarters of mining operations use some renewable energy and 39% are entirely renewable (when hydropower is included) according to Cambridge researchers who say the topic continues to be ""misrepresented."" The climate dynamics of crypto are complicated but it's simply not what corporations should be focusing on. It is a distraction from the basic learning about bitcoin many big companies still need according to several finance and crypto experts if they want to avoid being left behind by a fundamental transformation in the way money moves around the globe. Data from a recent CNBC survey shows that more company finance chiefs are taking bitcoin seriously. A survey of the CNBC Global CFO Council conducted in March found a big increase in chief financial officers who say bitcoin is for real — the percentage doubled to over 50% since the last time CNBC asked CFOs this question in 2017. Among U.S.-based CFOs specifically the percentage saying bitcoin is for real doubled as well from 33% to 65%. But most CFOs around the world over 80% also believe bitcoin is in a bubble and should not be accepted as a source of payment or held on the balance sheet.

I cannot imagine a Fortune 500 company having a CFO who does not understand it well and early. Wences Casares CEO of digital bank and bitcoin custodian Xapo

Casares says bitcoin believers benefitted from Musk putting the cryptocurrency on the balance sheet as it raised general awareness but it is not clear to him why that is a good move for a Tesla shareholder. For a hot Twitter moment on Sunday the world thought Musk was insinuating that Tesla was in fact selling off or had sold its bitcoin before he cleared up that confusion (for now at least) in a subsequent tweet. ""It feels speculative to me. He wasn't buying gold before"" said the digital banking CEO who also serves on the board of Diem the blockchain-based global payments project which grew out of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency concept. In fact Casares says a CFO who holds the view that bitcoin should not be a balance sheet holding is the one taking the correct view and it is a view that Musk hinted soon may be the case for Tesla again in a Sunday afternoon tweet insinuating the company might unload the stake or already was in the process of doing so even though his tweet earlier this week indicated the balance sheet stake would remain. ""I don't think there is a prescient need if you are CFO of an important global company to have bitcoin on the balance sheet right now especially if you were not buying gold to hedge currency risk as we think now of bitcoin as an option on gold"" Casares told the CNBC Global CFO Council on the recent virtual event. ""I think it would be wrong for me to say a CFO should hurry to do something here. I don't have a good argument for that but it would be a disservice if I said you can forget about this for now."" His warning for the executive class: if you don't take bitcoin and crypto seriously you will be making a mistake equivalent to telecom executives who ignored the internet in the 1990s and what it was going to do for information. ""It is hard to understand here we have the bones for something to happen that would be more relevant to a CFO than anyone else in a company and you'll do better if you learn it sooner rather than later"" he said. Casares says the market may not mature for a decade to two decades but added ""I cannot imagine a Fortune 500 company having a CFO who does not understand it well and early.""

Some finance executive are all-in on bitcoin

Some chief financial officers are digging into bitcoin more than others. David Sackett CFO at ULVAC Technologies a Massachusetts-based semiconductor supply subsidiary of a $2 billion market Japanese firm has been a bitcoin investor for years and as he watched the volatility of the cryptocurrency — rising and crashing hard and then rising again to a new high each time — he says as a finance executive what he sees is a scarce resource subject to supply and demand. ""I think it will come down again but go up in value even more"" he said. While Sackett says it is too early to think in terms of customers of the firm which include Intel wanting to buy in bitcoin he believes C-suites should embrace bitcoin as part of the balance sheet sooner rather than later. ""It's a hedge against the future right now"" he said. ""I'd rather get in now when the price is relatively low than when it is super high."" ""It will take decades for bitcoin to hit cruising altitude and it is hard for me to imagine it becoming less volatile"" Casares said. ""There is a correlation between appreciation of an asset and volatility and bitcoin has been the best-performing asset in recent years and it has been the most volatile. I would be worried if bitcoin volatility comes down"" he said. Sackett who allocated 10% of an individual retirement account to bitcoin in 2017 has been taking that message to his board. ""Let's have some available so when it does take off this company benefits"" he says of his pitch to the board. ""They didn't share my enthusiasm"" he added with the Japanese parent conservative by nature and the general belief that adding crypto to the balance sheet would not be consistent with the company's core focus of making money in the semiconductor market. But Sackett is not going to stop trying telling CNBC he will continue to make his case to the board in the future. ""If more people were educated on it I think more people would be open to it"" he said. ""The board knows my position and I will bring more evidence why I believe this and why it is a good decision.""

Can't dismiss bitcoin if you don't understand it

Deloitte has a team that's been actively engaging corporate treasury and financial departments on cryptocurrency and while its experts think Sackett's hedging view is aggressive — they don't think CFOs should feel compelled to buy bitcoin based on the premise if they wait longer they will be forced to pay higher prices — they do agree it is time for executives to get educated on crypto. ""It's hard for a company to make a decision if they are not informed and we are still in the education phase"" said Amy Park U.S. audit & assurance blockchain & digital assets partner at Deloitte. ""It's not just the CFO but the audit committee and board and treasury and finance so much that needs to get around making this change or moving to it as a form of investment."" ""It's hard to have a view if you're not educated"" said Rob Massey Deloitte's global tax leader of blockchain and cryptocurrency. ""If you are a big company that has large amounts of funds moving across borders that's probably a pain point for you and you should probably be thinking about this"" he said. ""Don't run towards it but have a point of view based on information and experience. It is new and complicated and that is why the board should be asking 'are we doing enough to understand it?'""

watch now

Even if bitcoin does not turn out to be a singular crypto winner of the future central bank digital currencies are coming with China moving ahead and the Federal Reserve currently studying the issue and expected to release a white paper with MIT covering its views. One way to prepare for the world of CBDCs is to engage with cryptos now. That doesn't mean buying for the balance sheet but ""it's a reason to engage an effective way to test points of view and how get ready"" Massey said. Alexander Bant chief of research in Gartner's finance practice says he sees most CFOs now saying bitcoin is not a fad but they still see a high degree of risk due to the volatility and regulatory concerns. Even since Microstrategy Square and Musk bought bitcoin for Tesla's balance sheet more CFO clients have proactively come to Gartner asking for information they can use in discussions with their board though not the majority of CFOs and not in terms of making a pitch like Sackett's to his C-suite. ""They are not in the selling it to the board camp but making sure the board is knowledgeable on bitcoin. CFOs never like to get caught off guard"" Bant said. ""We think digital payments will be something CFOs need to be well versed in in a standard sense but it is still wait-and-see to understand if it is bitcoin or ether or other coins. ... We haven't seen something like this in hundreds of years. We're talking about really using a different form of currency to do transactions across the globe and over the past 12 months we've seen more CFOs willing to entertain the conversation. ... they've got to get boards and investors and all parties thinking the same.""

KNOXVILLE Tenn. – The Razorbacks run Rocky Top.

No. 1 Arkansas took full control of the SEC with a 3-2 victory against No. 4 Tennessee on Sunday afternoon at Lindsey Nelson Stadium. The Hogs now 39-10 overall and 19-8 in SEC play have won all nine of their conference series this season and own a two-game lead over second-place Mississippi State in the Western Division.

Starter Lael Lockhart gave Arkansas exactly what it needed striking out seven in 4 1/3 innings of one-run ball. He turned the ballgame over to the pen which combined to throw the final 4 2/3 innings.

Kevin Kopps did most of the heavy lifting striking out four in 3 2/3 innings to lock down the Hogs’ win and improve his record to 9-0 on the year.

Robert Moore delivered at the plate with two runs batted in including the game-winning RBI single in the top of the ninth.

Arkansas now returns home for the final series of the regular season. The Razorbacks host Florida at Baum-Walker Stadium getting the three-game set underway at 6 p.m. Thursday May 20 on the SEC Network.

Hog Highlights

Arkansas is the third SEC team to win its first nine series in a season joining Vanderbilt (2013) and Florida (2018). Vanderbilt is only SEC team in history to win all of their conference series (2013).

Dave Van Horn moved into fifth place for most victories (739) by an SEC baseball coach with Sunday’s win passing former South Carolina coach Ray Tanner (738).

Arkansas sits alone atop the SEC standings. The Razorbacks have a two-game lead over Mississippi State in the SEC West and will claim at least a share of the division title with one win during the upcoming three-game series against Florida.

With Sunday’s win the Hogs finish the regular season with a 13-5 record in road games. Arkansas is 16-5 in all games away from Baum-Walker Stadium including the season-opening trip to the State Farm College Baseball Showdown at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas.

“What Susan understood was that children’s ability to learn is influenced by their emotional state” Representative Ruth B. Balser a Newton Democrat and psychologist and lead sponsor of the Safe and Supportive Schools act.

“And Susan was a wonderful advocate” Balser added. “She was relentless in her lobbying and she also taught her students how to lobby. Legislators get the credit when bills pass but it’s actually people like Susan who make it happen.”

Ms. Cole’s attention to the issue was prompted by an experience she had she was an attorney for the nonprofit Massachusetts Advocates for Children.

While representing students expelled from Boston’s schools Ms. Cole sought a diagnosis for a 15-year-old client and was surprised to learn that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

At that point she had already been an advocate on behalf of special education students but the PTSD diagnosis led her to consider whether trauma of some sort had affected many students who seemed to fall outside typical special-ed categories.

“Trauma is a major problem in our schools” she told the Globe in 2005 the year she was the principal coauthor of “Helping Traumatized Children Learn” a landmark report and guide for educators. “It explains many underlying problems that teachers face every single day.”

In a 2014 HuffPost essay she said it was “time to bring trauma’s impact on learning out of the shadows and make it a regular part of the way schools are run.”

The causes for such trauma she said in a 2019 essay on the American Association of School Administrators website can be seen in everything from exposure to domestic violence to bullying at school violence in the community or homelessness.

Ms. Cole went on to found and direct the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative a collaborative effort between Massachusetts Advocates for Children and Harvard Law School.

She also founded and directed the Education Law Clinic at Harvard Law School where she was a lecturer. At the time of her death she also was a senior project director at Massachusetts Advocates for Children.

“Susan’s work enabled the most vulnerable of our children to have the opportunity and dignity of a meaningful education one that might have otherwise been denied to them” John F. Manning Harvard Law’s dean wrote in a message to the school community.

“And Susan not only helped make a difference for many individuals” he added “she created effective strategies that spurred needed change within entire schools districts and state education systems.”

Ms. Cole “was a true champion for kids” said Ryan Powers assistant superintendent for the Bridgewater-Raynham Regional School District and a former elementary school principal in Brockton where he helped implement approaches her trauma project developed.

Just before the pandemic began the two traveled to San Diego where she made a presentation to an American Association of School Administrators conference.

“There was no stone that she left unturned in terms of her work” Powers said. “She put things in place for kids but I guess what struck me the most was that it was never at the 10000-foot level looking down and saying ‘Here’s this policy.’ It was ‘I am going to support you. You can do this work and I’m going to be a resource for you.’ ""

Susan Frances Cole was born in Chicago on Aug. 4 1948 and at age 5 moved with her family to Milledgeville Ga. and then to Macon Ga.

Her mother Anne Tucker Cole was a schoolteacher. Her father Harvey Cole was a bacteriologist who later opened a toy store.

Growing up at a time when the Holocaust’s horrors were becoming better known and troubled by the South’s racism Ms. Cole “wanted to heal the world” said her husband David Eisen a principal at Abacus Architects and Planners.

“I think this was a thread from the beginning to the end of her life” he added.

She spent two years at the University of Georgia before transferring to Boston University determined to leave the South. “She reveled in the freedom that Boston offered” said Eisen whom she married in 1986.

Ms. Cole graduated with a bachelor’s in social work and later received a master’s in special education from the University of Oregon.

She was a teacher at the Walter E. Fernald State School in Waltham when lawsuits prompted improvements for those with developmental disabilities at Massachusetts facilities.

“I think she was deeply affected by that” said Eisen who added that “she wanted to do things at the policy level. She realized that if she wanted to make real institutional change she would need a law degree.”

Ms. Cole graduated from Northeastern University School of Law and had worked for the National Labor Relations Board before joining the Massachusetts Advocates for Children staff.

Through her work at Harvard Law School Ms. Cole inspired students such as Michael Gregory who became her collaborator coauthor coteacher and friend.

“Susan was a fierce advocate” said Gregory a clinical professor of law at the school and senior attorney for the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative. “She knew what her vision was what her purpose was and lived that in every minute of her life.”

Part of that vision was helping guide the education and lives of students.

“She was a connector” Gregory said. “Susan couldn’t abide the fragmentation of the world. She wanted to bring everything and everybody together. She wanted people to form relationships and community with each other.”

In addition to her husband Ms. Cole leaves their son Ben Eisen of Queens N.Y. and her brother Stuart of Rancho Palos Verdes Calif.

A funeral service has been held and a memorial gathering will be announced.

Despite Ms. Cole’s packed professional life “she always had a pot of chicken soup at home when we arrived late from New York” said Ben’s wife Emily Cohn. “She was always so kind and so welcoming and at the same time was the kind of person you wanted to make proud and impress because she was so impressive and strong-willed.”

Ben said his mother “had a fighting spirit I would say and she was an incredibly warm person.” Her tenacity he and Emily added made Ms. Cole’s death feel unexpected.

She was diagnosed a decade ago and was once told she had two years to live at best. Instead she lived nearly seven more and taught her last class — online due to the pandemic — nine days before she died.

“She wanted to finish this semester and she did” Ben said.

Even online “the classroom was a very intimate space for Susan” Gregory said.

During the last class Ms. Cole set aside time for their eight students to express appreciation for something someone else in the class had done.

“It took up half the class because all of the students had so many wonderful things to say” Gregory said. “That kind of learning community was really what Susan was all about.”

What is needed now from wealthier nations is more support and transformative innovations for the rapid expansion of social protection to ensure that we navigate this storm that we save lives and avoid further rolling back of hard-earned development gains. Given that 1 in 4 of the world’s people will live in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050 this is in all our interests and we know that none of us are safe from this pandemic until all of us are safe.

This year’s theme for the internationally marked day is about addressing the impact of new technology on the well-being of families — and here too we see major inequities that impact African children the most as well as huge opportunity to accelerate change for families.

Africa embraces technology. Vibrant pockets of tech start-ups cross the continent from Nairobi’s ‘Silicon Savanna’ to Nigeria’s ‘Yabacon Valley’. And COVID has helped highlight this potential – from deliveries of vaccines in hard-to-reach areas of Malawi and Ghana to innovative new ways of identifying recipients of cash transfer programmes in Togo.

But frankly beyond these pockets of innovation potential most sub-Saharan African families still struggle to get even the most basic digital access for their children with internet access rates in the order of 10 per cent compared to their wealthy nation peers at up to 85 per cent. As a result when schools closed across the continent learning completely stopped for millions of children in the region who had no access to online learning.

Across sub-Saharan Africa the COVID-induced economic crisis has pushed an additional 50 million people into extreme poverty – in other words those living on less than $1.90 a day. These are the families that need our collective support through tried and tested mechanisms such as social protection.

In advanced economies families have received much needed stimulus to cover the bare necessities while in the Sub-Saharan African region governments struggled to provide even a small fraction of this temporary support to families. We must start to reduce this glaring inequity – all families deserve access to social protection wherever on the globe they live. Providing safety nets to African families is a small commitment by international standards but one that can deliver enormous gains – from lifting children out of the absolute danger zone of malnutrition to getting them back to learning and enabling them to stay safe from early marriage.

But most governments simply don’t have the resources available domestically. They need practical support to meet the vast and growing financing gaps which begins with more comprehensive debt relief along with grants concessional and innovative finance.

As we mark this international day let’s make sure that all families have access to both technology and social protection that have enabled global families to weather life's big shocks. Through smart debt relief and strong commitments of external support we not only can – but must - ensure that every family around the world can move beyond this pandemic.

Photo / 123RF

The New Zealand arm of global investment bank Goldman Sachs made a bumper profit last year but it also faces a potential liability relating to holiday pay.

Financial accounts for the business show it made $13.67 million in the year to December 31 - more than double the $5.18m it made in 2019.

That saw it pay a dividend of $12m for the year after paying no dividend in 2019.

Goldman Sachs NZ is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Holdings ANZ. Its ultimate parent is the New York Stock Exchange-listed Goldman Sachs Group.

The accounts also show Goldman faces a potential liability relating to its exclusion of ""discretionary"" bonus payments from calculations for entitlements to the Holidays Act.

In 2020 the Employment Court found that the incentive scheme payments of a particular employer even if described as discretionary must be included in various calculations under the Holidays Act.

However the Goldman Sachs report noted the case is headed back to court.

""... the Court of Appeal is due to hear an appeal against the Employment Court's decision in July 2021 (noting also that the outcome of such appeal could be appealed to the Supreme Court).""

Due to the possibility of further court action the report said that the liability could not be reliably determined until the outcome of the Court of Appeal decision and possibly the Supreme Court decision if it was appealed further was known.

The investment bank's revenue rose from $23.65m in 2019 to $40.67m in 2020. Its 2020 revenue all came from investment banking with no service fee income.

Operating expenses also rose from $16.5m to $21.2m largely driven by a rise in investment banking expenses which increased from $2.575m to $7.968m.

But the cost of staff salaries bonus payments and other employee benefits were down from $7.665m to $7.095m.

The accounts also show its auditing costs jumped over the year from $50000 to $66000.

Goldman Sachs NZ warned that there continued to be uncertainty regarding the impact of Covid-19 on the near term economic outlook even with the early efforts to distribute vaccines.

""The company has been monitoring its operational and financial performance and the extent of the impact thereon will depend on future developments including the duration and continued spread of the outbreak.""

Group profit

In January Goldman Sachs Group reported net revenues of US$44.56 billion and net earnings of US$9.46 billion for the year ended December 31 2020.

Its net revenue was 22 per cent higher than 2019 and its highest annual net revenue in 11 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb29rZmllbGQuY29tL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvaW5zaWdodHMvdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtemVyby1jYXJib24td29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transforming Businesses for a Zero-Carbon World | Brookfield,"Introduction

Climate change poses unprecedented risks to the global economy—and of course to all our livelihoods.

With the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) occurring this November in Glasgow some countries are ramping up their efforts to combat these risks. The U.K. the host country of COP26 announced a new pledge to reduce carbon1 emissions by 78% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Meanwhile the U.S. which rejoined the Paris climate accord this year pledged to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Lastly the German government in response to a ruling by the constitutional court that it was unfairly burdening the younger generation raised its target for reducing carbon emissions by 2030 from 55% to 65%. It also brought forward its net-zero target by five years—to 2045 from 2050.2

Governments have also been focusing on “green” budgets. The U.K.’s 10-point plan includes big new targets for offshore wind generation investment in low-carbon hydrogen production capacity and the introduction of a ban in 2030 on the sale of new petrol cars.3 And the Biden administration’s proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan includes funding for projects like electric vehicle charging stations and the expansion of transmission lines for wind and solar electricity.4

Carbon prices are another policy lever that governments can pull. They create incentives for decarbonization by incorporating the cost of greenhouse gas emissions into the price of goods and services. The result is that companies—and investors—will need to consider the future cost of carbon since it will lead to changes in the way they allocate capital.5 And carbon pricing has shown to be a powerful tool: Emissions from sectors covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System are estimated to have fallen by 21% from 2005 to 2020.6

While carbon prices are operational or in the planning stages in many jurisdictions around the world most of them price carbon at only $40 or less per ton.7 In Canada however the government is now legislating a steady increase in the carbon tax such that it reaches C$170 per ton by 2030 from the federal price of C$40 per ton today.8 Overall governments are making progress but they still have a long way to go.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzRiNmE1YWIyLTlmNmQtNDExNi04ZDhmLTljMDlmN2IzYWVmMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US banks could cut 200000 jobs over next decade top analyst says,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

By Kristina Vakhman

David Peterson grew up playing in the sand piles of his grandfather’s greenhouse. He still remembers the pansies in the plant nursery and how his grandfather sold Christmas trees and wreaths.

“I was like my grandfather’s shadow” said Peterson who has proudly carried on his grandfather’s legacy by running the family business Peterson Landscaping Services.

Now after more than 40 years of serving the West Hartford community Peterson has passed the torch and merged Peterson Landscaping Services with Brothers Associates Landscaping.

“I’m very very pleased with the transition to the brothers” Peterson said. “That’s like a dream come true to me that they can carry on. That’s what my family would want.”

Peterson’s Landscaping Services on Grassmere Avenue was a long-standing staple in the West Hartford community. It was started by Peterson’s grandfather Gustave who came to the United States from Sweden in 1899. Gustave first worked for his brother’s business the greenhouses on Whiting Lane that are now part of Whiting Lane School and also as a gardener to Elizabeth Park and the town’s wealthy.

In 1929 Gustave went off on his own and formed Peterson’s Flower Shop. It expanded and became Peterson Landscaping Services in 1962 when Gustave’s son Peterson’s father took over. Peterson and his brother worked summers.

When Peterson graduated from college in 1973 the business was once again passed down a generation this time to him. He used his economics and business degree to grow Peterson Landscaping further and to adapt it to changing times.

“I actually think that I’ve held the reins longer than any of the others [in my family]. Although as long as my father was alive he was still the boss” Peterson said laughing.

But a family business needs family to keep going and with the next generations of Petersons taking different career paths Peterson had to look elsewhere.

Half-brothers Gary Santos and Eddie Salvador of Brothers Associates Landscaping were the obvious choice. Peterson said that because they’re family friends of 40 years and great landscapers Santos and Salvador were the best fit.

“My wife and David’s wife they know each other and we hang out and go out to dinner” Salvador said.

The brothers were happy to take over Peterson’s customer base and staff as they’ve looked up to the work Peterson and his father did ever since they met at Connecticut Groundskeeper Association meetings.

“We hold the same standards that [David’s] father and the generations before him did” Santos said.

After Peterson’s customers saw that the Brothers Associates’ work upholds Peterson’s quality Salvador said they were pleased with the shift.

“We haven’t had any resistance at all. Everything’s been pretty smooth” he said.

The transition took place at the start of the year. But even with the business now under Santos and Salvador Peterson isn’t slowing down in his retirement. He’s on the Dean’s Advisory Board at the College of Agriculture Health and Natural Resources at the University of Connecticut. He’s also Connecticut’s representative to the National Council for Agricultural Research Extension and Teaching.

Peterson said he can now comfortably focus on these obligations. He knows Peterson Landscaping Services’ customer base and help will be in good hands with Santos and Salvador.

“It’s been a blessing. [My father] would be so happy that these two guys were willing to accept the legacy that he left in his lifetime” Peterson said.

He and his older brother Ken spent their formative years playing basketball or baseball at the park or just playing with the other kids in the neighborhood.

Phelan a basketball star at Northwest Catholic High and St. Francis (Pa.) and was inducted into the school’s Hall of Fame in 2019 always had a special spot in his heart for the court off Whitney Street. When he coached at the University of Hartford he would bring his players there sometimes. He brought his grandchildren there.

Back in the day in the late ’60s and early ’70s it was his court. Players would come from all parts of the city to play Jack Phelan and his friends.

The court is still there a little worse for wear.

“He used to drive by and he would look and see who was playing out here” his son Jack said. “He kind of always thought it would be nice if they fixed it up.”

Phelan died suddenly on July 20 2020 at age 66. He had touched many lives as a college coach and later for 17 years as an athletic director at Farmington High.

Eric Crawford was one of those lives. He played for Phelan for two years at Hartford before graduating in 1985 and then serving as his assistant coach. He calls Phelan a father figure. When Phelan died Crawford wanted to do something special in his memory.

Maybe they could refurbish his favorite basketball court.

It was more complicated than Crawford thought. But with some help from Connecticut representative Matt Ritter the Speaker of the House whose family knew the Phelan family and a local architectural firm who donated its time and expertise Crawford is hoping that work will be started by Phelan’s birthday in June.

“I had no idea” Crawford said. “Nobody was taking care of the court. I thought I’d raise a few dollars put down some new asphalt new lines. Some benches. Maybe raise $50-60000.”

It turned out the architectural work alone would cost that much Crawford said and the total renovation would cost around $150000. A local firm Freeman Companies donated its time and coordinated meetings with the zoning board historical society and park and recreation department.

Crawford then turned to Ritter who had gone to Phelan’s basketball camps when he was a kid and whose family was close to the Phelans.

“[Jack] was a tremendous person” Ritter said. “When Eric talked about it I said ‘Look let’s try to make it happen.’ The court needed some repair anyway. I think the original thought was to try to do some fundraising for the court individually but that park needs other improvements as well and some of the neighbors approached me about some other renovations so we decided to combine it and the state will pay for the upgrades.”

Jack Phelan when he started his job as athletic director at Farmington High School in 2003.

There will be benches for people to sit and watch games. Phrases Phelan used to say to his players: “Go hard or go home” and “Take care of your community” will be featured as part of the design.

“I think the courts in the city should have some kind of messaging around them” Crawford said. “The kids spend so much time there that’s another avenue we can make it a learning experience about equity getting along going to school. We need to utilize that space for a message board for these kids.”

Crawford who is the director of CREC Family Resource Center at the Wilson-Gray YMCA in Hartford came from Buffalo N.Y. one of Phelan’s first Division I recruits when Hartford upgraded its program from Division II. He didn’t know anyone when he came to Hartford and ended up staying with the Phelans until he could get into the dorms.

“That’s why I do so well working with these kids” he said. “I was one of these kids. Jack knew if I had to go back to Buffalo I was going to wind up somewhere I shouldn’t so he made me stay here in the summer got me summer jobs. I never had a father role model. The way he dressed the way he talked he didn’t take no [garbage]. I started imitating that.

“He told me ‘Look you’re not going to go to the NBA because you wouldn’t be in this car with me. But I guarantee you if you do right by this program in school and you stay in the Hartford area you’ll do well. I’m not about getting guys in the NBA. I’m about making sure they get an education and do something for this city.'”

This is the legacy Phelan left.

On Friday Crawford looked around the park where the court is. The grass in the park hadn’t been mowed recently. There are no benches for people to sit on and watch games. The current court is a slab of asphalt with two baskets. An old fence near Whitney Avenue keeps the basketballs from rolling into the street.

“This place is going to look totally different” Crawford said. “He’s too important to too many people to pass away and nothing be put in place.

“That court meant a lot to Jack. That’s what kept me going. He used to get pissed off when the city didn’t take care of that court. People don’t understand the history of this court and what it meant. He grew up on it. The Eddie Griffins and some of the legendary players in Hartford used to come to Elizabeth Park so they could play against Jack and his boys Chuckie Harding Packy Cosgrove and all them.

“There was very few interactions between [different] parts of the city. But Jack was at Elizabeth – that was his park. These guys knew of Jack because he was at Northwest – they said ‘Let’s go up here and play this white dude.’ So they brought their guys from the North End there and Jack would beat them on the court. Those were some tough Irish guys.

“That was when Hartford had all the racial stuff going on. But that park was off limits to that. Those guys used to battle all the time. Jack Phelan used to go to Keney Park which was unheard of back in the day and get into these heated basketball games and there’d be crowds of people watching. He used to tell me about how they forged relationships and up until he died he was very good friends with all those guys.”

Joe Origins',"The hype for Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins began at Toy Fair New York last year and following a pandemic-related detour from its original theatrical launch last October the big-screen reboot of Hasbro‘s popular military franchise is back on track for a July 23 debut. During the 2021 MTV Movie & TV Awards Snake Eyes star Henry Golding unleashed a brief yet action-packed first look at the film that has since been released online.

The short 59-second trailer offers quick glimpses of the brewing rivalry between Snake Eyes (Golding) and Storm Shadow (Andrew Koji) along with a quick appearance by G.I. Joe’s Scarlett (Samara Weaving) and Cobra’s Baroness (Úrsula Corberó) — characters that first appeared in Hasbro’s 1982 G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toy line.

Just minutes after the trailer debuted Paramount Pictures released a second video entitled 5 Things You (Probably) Didn’t Know About Snake Eyes. The video delves into the filmmakers’ goal of updating the G.I. Joe lore for a new generation alongside longtime G.I. Joe comic book writer Larry Hama.

Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins premieres July 23 only in theaters. A kid-focused line of action figures vehicles and role-play items will hit stores this summer while a collector-focused wave of movie-inspired action figures will join the G.I. Joe: Classified Series this fall. The film was directed by Robert Schwentke (Allegiant) from a screenplay by Evan Spiliotopoulos Anna Waterhouse and Joe Shrapnel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L3RpZ2VyLXRveXMtaGFzYnJvLWktZG9nLWludGVyYWN0aXZlLW11c2ljLWNvbXBhbmlvbi1pcG9k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Tiger Toys/Hasbro i-Dog Interactive Music Companion,"Pros: A simple fun and inexpensive robotic dog that sonically and visually interacts with your iPod or operates separately. Battery powered includes a speaker and its own set of noises and songs.

Cons: Each of its features particularly its pre-programmed audio light and motor output begs for more sophistication. i-Dog 2 anyone?

If you’re an animal lover or you’re of the belief that there aren’t enough legitimately fun add-ons for the iPod Tiger Toys’ i-Dog ($29.99) will most likely bring a smile to your face. Originally developed by the toymaking arm of Sega in Japan i-Dog is a full-sized iPod matching robotic dog that does five things: it puts on a light show makes limited head movements plays back and responds to audio connected through its body plays back a limited variety of songs stored in its own memory and responds to input from a built-in microphone. Together these features will charm kids intrigue adults and perplex live animals – not a bad combination for the low price.

Advertisements

To get the boring parts out of the way first i-Dog is a small plastic toy a little larger than a full-sized iPod almost entirely glossy white with highly attractive chrome and transparent accents. A battery compartment in its left rear leg is sealed with a Philips head screw and holds two AA batteries. Each of its legs has gray four rubber pads arrayed like paw prints and its only obvious button is a tiny white reset button under its chin. All of its exciting parts are hidden until you turn it on by pressing its chrome nose button.

Advertisements

The first thing you’ll notice is i-Dog’s light show – it consists of an array of seven multicolored face lights arrayed in a flower-like pattern moving in ones twos or all together.

Each light show begins spontaneously in an almost alien approximation of a real dog’s facial gestures. According to the toy’s manual the lights change colors and move in response to mood and music: if the dog is happy certain colors and patterns will appear or angry others. You make him happy by feeding him music and other audio input – we’ll explain more on that later.

Advertisements

His head also moves in two different ways – there’s a motor in i-Dog’s neck that lets his head twist back and forth and his transparent plastic ears flip up and down too. The product’s biggest disappointment – albeit partially understandable – is that its range of motion is so limited. i-Dog’s front legs are said to be positionable but they barely move and nothing else moves by itself. A funny transparent tail is used as a mute switch when an audio cable’s connected to i-Dog and tweaks the dog into action when nothing is connected. It would be nice to see a more animated response but admittedly i-Dog probably shouldn’t be going anywhere with your iPod in tow.

Advertisements

Connecting an iPod (or other device) to i-Dog is simple. You’ll need a minijack-to-minijack audio cable – a forgivable omission for the price – that runs from your iPod to a small covered port on i-Dog’s right side.

Once you plug this in your iPod controls the volume of a speaker that’s built into iDog’s body projecting sound through a set of holes in its back. Sound quality is entirely acceptable for the price albeit monaural and obviously not a complete replacement for real speakers. More significantly i-Dog makes attempts to respond to the music with light displays and head motions though it’s more comical and imprecise than fans of visualizers (or robots) might hope.

Advertisements

If you don’t want to use i-Dog with an iPod it makes its own sounds – slightly robotic barks attention whimpers and goofy music that sounds like it could have come from an early cell phone or Sega video game. It also shakes its head moves its ears and puts on a light show – once every few minutes until you hold its nose button to turn it off. At that point it performs the audio equivalent of a gears-winding-down song – just enough to make you feel guilty that you’ve deactivated it a cute touch.

Advertisements

i-Dog also has a microphone built into the bottom of its head which in our testing rarely responded to words but did respond to being tapped in a petting fashion. Depending on its mood i-Dog responded to the tapping with different light shows and sounds but didn’t store samples and play them back.

Finally it’s also worth noting that i-Dog has a bit of depth: the manual explains that you need to “feed” i-Dog music five minutes every hour to keep it satisfied either directly through its input port or through the microphone. Over time this will give i-Dog a “personality” of “rock/punk” (red outer ring of lights) “dance/techno” (green) or “hip hop/rap” (yellow) and the more you feed it the better its “mood” as indicated by different patterns of light movements. A light sensor on the top of its head puts it in sleep mode as long as it’s dark and quiet but light or noise will wake it up – another interesting touch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L21hcnZlbC1sZWdlbmRzLXgtbWVuLWRlYWRwb29sLWZpZ3VyZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvel Legends X-Men Deadpool figure review – BAF Strong Guy wave — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2021/05/16/marvel-legends-x-men-deadpool-figure-review/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L21hcnZlbC1sZWdlbmRzLXgtbWVuLWRlYWRwb29sLWZpZ3VyZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzUvZ2ktam9lLXNuYWtlLWV5ZXMtdHJhaWxlci1oZW5yeS1nb2xkaW5nLWludGVydmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Snake Eyes' Henry Golding Trailer and Interview,"You are reading your free article for this month.

Ahead of it’s launch in July Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins has now dropped it’s first trailer offering fans of the beloved franchise a first taste of what’s to come.

Starring Henry Golding as the elusive ninja assassin the new film is Hasbro and Paramount’s reboot of the cinematic universe focusing solely on the origin story of Snake Eyes himself. The new trailer (which you can watch above) showcases snippets of the character’s backstory as well as his journey to becoming one of the deadliest swordsmen in the world with action-packed sequences all throughout the clip.

Despite the success of The Rise of Cobra and Retaliation it’s not too surprising that the two companies have decided to reboot the franchise with a bigger picture vision like that of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or DC’s Extended Universe. Joining us at HYPEBEAST Henry Golding runs us through how he became the iconic swordsman his work with choreographer Kenji Tanigaki to learn the elegant art of katanas how the character’s creator Larry Hama molded this new adaptation and his thoughts on greater Asian representation within Hollywood.

1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3

How were you first introduced to the G.I. Joe universe? Were you a fan of the comic books or the previous films before joining this project?

I think it was definitely the comic books growing up. I was a huge lover of Transformers and weirdly the first comic book I read was the Transformers and G.I. Joe crossover which blew my mind. You know growing up in the U.K. predominantly G.I. Joe wasn’t as big as it was in America so when the new movies came out they really boosted everything. Obviously my great friend Jon M. Chu did Retaliation and did a crazy job directing that so the G.I. Joe universe has been around but it’s amazing to be able to take a refreshed look at these characters and build the universe from the ground up. Now we start with the origin of one of the most anticipated characters which is Snake Eyes.

You’ve obviously been in quite a few big films before like Crazy Rich Asians and The Gentlemen but Snake Eyes seems to be the first time you’ve really dived deep into the action film genre. How was it like preparing for such a physically intense role?

Yeah we did two months of solid training in the run up in the pre-production days. We had a choreographer called Kenji Tanigaki who worked with Donnie Yen and Jackie Chan back in the day and he did amazing sword artistry in the film Rurouni Kenshin based on the anime. Those fight sequences are beyond anything you’ve ever seen so if you’ve never watched it check it out but that’s what we’ve incorporated in Snake Eyes. For me as an actor it was really important to learn the sword art of katanas. We keep it quite traditional. There’s a real pressure these days to make it like John Wick but in reality — this film being based in Japan — that’s not how they fight especially the Arashikage which it’s predominantly weapons so we really concentrated on the close combat katana work. All of our characters and actors went through the same training to become who they are so it really shows in the movie. All of the stunts we do ourselves so we’ve put in the blood sweat and tears learning from the amazing stuntmen and women. The finished product is mind-boggling — it’s so much fun.

With Ray Park portraying Snake Eyes in the previous films you’ve said that your character and the new spin-off is a departure from that universe with Hasbro and Paramount deciding to dive into a new timeline. Can you tell us more about this iteration of the G.I. Joe universe? Does it tie in at all with the previous movies?

It doesn’t tie in with the old movies at all. It keeps to the core values of G.I. Joe and Cobra is definitely still around. Concentrating on one particular character for the first movie allowed us to really dig the foundations for where this universe is going to be heading. We didn’t have to think beyond a handful of characters or what’s happening in which part of the universe. What’s happening right in front of us — that’s what we were concerned about and that was the character development of Snake Eyes himself as a man rather than an operator. We see his faults we see his dreams we see his motivations we see his past mistakes that he’s made and lessons he’s learnt and his journey of becoming who we all know and love and that’s Snake Eyes.

With a Snake Eyes standalone spin-off we know you’ve worked quite closely with the original character’s creator Larry Hama. How was your experience working with him and how has he influenced your take on the iconic character?

Larry is an absolute legend. He has created so many iconic characters so to have him as an executive producer and oversee the story development of these characters was so important to us because the last thing we want is to take away from the core fans of the G.I. Joe universe and alienating them. We wanted to develop more on top of what we already know but also give more of a history to these characters. In the past we know a more convoluted history of who Snake Eyes was but nothing that we could really build upon. So starting over again was really important to set that standard. We came up with a character that people will admire and will feel the true sense of jeopardy for his decision. I think people will understand that he could be any of us — we could be Snake Eyes. He’s no one special he’s not a superhero with special powers. He’s just a guy who grinded super hard made tough choices and dedicated his life to a purpose. Any one of us could do that and that’s what we wanted to drill home.

Speaking to Joe Taslim recently about his role as Sub-Zero in Mortal Kombat he saw the film as a strong step forward for greater Asian representation in Hollywood. With yourself playing the main protagonist in such an iconic franchise and blockbuster do you see Snake Eyes as further progress for diversity and greater representation in the film industry?

100 percent. The first thing that I came across when seeing if I wanted to be Snake Eyes was the fact that people were like “This Asian guy can’t be Snake Eyes he’s meant to be white! He’s not meant to talk!” Because they think it has to be a fish out of water story: he goes to Japan and doesn’t understand the culture but learns. But I’m like “You do realize that every single culture is so different.” A Korean coming down to Thailand would not feel at home. Maybe they look similar in one way or another but you do realize that even as an American moving to Germany everybody might look like you but it’s not the same culture. So I wanted to normalize that and create a character which ruffled those feathers and make people question their understanding of culture and race. I think we definitely achieved that and stirred the hornet’s nest but for good reason because we want to normalize that conversation and open the eyes of people who only see color and only see race. The world is so much more complex so to have a character like Snake Eyes portrayed as an Asian American going halfway across the world and not feeling at home in a place that he’s never been was really important for us. It doesn’t detract from that fish out of water story.

With the advent of more representation on screen you know we have Simu [Liu] being Shang-Chi we’ve got the entire cast of Mortal Kombat of Warrior of all of these fantastic projects that are raising the flag and setting the standard it’s only going to go from strength to strength. People are going to realize that it really doesn’t matter where you’re from. Let’s make sure these characters are done justice. Playing Sub-Zero for Joe was a huge huge thing and coming from Indonesia as well as Iko [Uwais] they are carving history as actors from their country. I think Joe really came off as the favorite character in the movie so I hope they do 101 spin-offs of Sub-Zero!

Carol almost made it too. At the last second Thanos threw his sword at the quantum tunnel like a javelin destroying it leading to a series of events that culminated in Tony Stark sacrificing his life to ultimately end Thanos.

Hasbro has been on a hot streak as of late dropping new MCU Marvel Legends figures left and right. Some of these reveals have been a part of their new series of figures commemorating Marvel Studios' Infinity Saga.

RESCUE AND CAPTAIN MARVEL TEAMING UP!

Hasbro has revealed a new Amazon exclusive Avengers: Endgame-inspired action figure box set featuring Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts in her Rescue armor and Brie Larson's Carol Danvers as well as a variety of accessories. Check it out below:

Hasbro

The packaging is nicely designed with that stylish looking Infinity Saga logo that has been ever-present on this wave of figures.

As one can see Hasbro did not skimp on the accessories with this set although perhaps they could have included power effects to attach to Carol's arms?

The Pepper figure comes with an alternate head featuring a pretty solid Gwenyth Paltrow likeness which utilizes Hasbro's proprietary PhotoReal face printing technology.

And the Captain Marvel figure features a screen-accurate hairstyle. Fans can pose their Rocket figure asking Carol if she's going to get another haircut.

MORE MARVEL LEGENDS TO COME!

Hasbro has been on a tear lately announcing a lot of new MCU figures at a pretty decent clip. There were figures shown recently for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier WandaVision Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Tings and Loki. Not to mention their ongoing reveals for the Infinity Saga collection. And they're just getting started.

The toy maker has plans to release figures based on the rest of Marvel Studios' 2021 MCU installments as well including What If...? Eternals and Spider-Man: No Way Home. After a light year for MCU figures in 2020 Hasbro is back in a huge way."

But Saturday morning started off with some good news. Colonial Pipeline which delivers 45% of all the fuel used along the East Coast announced that since its  the system has returned to ""normal operations delivering millions of gallons per hour...""

On Saturday May 8 Colonial Pipeline said it had been the previous day and had halted all pipeline operations to deal with the threat.



The shutdown caused many to flock to gas stations in eastern states especially North Carolina which has been hit harder than other states. The state depends heavily on the Colonial Pipeline whereas states on the East Coast have larger ports they can readily access where gas is shipped in. declaring a state of emergency in North Carolina. The order also temporarily suspends motor vehicle fuel regulations to ensure adequate fuel supply supplies throughout the state.

“The panic is not rational” said Dr. Dara Bushman a clinical psychologist in Asheville told News 13 earlier in the week. “But people feel scared and they feel they don’t have control so at least if they’re in a gas line waiting they’re doing something about it to make it happen.”





The North Carolina Attorney General's Office has been fielding throughout the state all week. Charging excessively high prices is illegal during a state of emergency in North Carolina.



On Friday gas stations in the mountains that received fuel supplies reported being cleared out within just a few hours due to demand.

Gas supply is expected to be back to normal in days but that’s not stopping many from waiting in long lines still this weekend.

The Hershey Bears clinched the AHL’s North Division with a 3-2 win over the Binghamton Devils on Saturday. It is the Bears’ 20th division title and first since 2016.

The AHL will not be awarding a Calder Cup this season and left the playoffs up to each division. The North will not be doing playoffs and the Bears will be awarded the Oke Trophy.

“It’s not the Calder Cup but it’s something” Bears coach Spencer Carberry said.

In an atypical year especially without playoffs the team needed something to play. The division was that something.

“You find something to play for and take pride in” Bears captain Matt Moulson said. “We wanted it [badly].”

Hershey was down 1-0 after the opening period but scored three quick goals from Paul LaDue Aliaksei Protas and Connor McMichael to take a 3-1 lead with 20 minutes to go. The Devils would score early in the third but the Bears held on to claim the title.

“There were a few key moments in the second period where there were a couple of fights it got chippy” Bears goalie Zach Fucale said. “Everybody got dialed in and it was a good time. It was a great game I thought.”

The Bears can also finish with the best record based on points percentage in the league with a win on Sunday against the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins.

“I would be lying if I said no” Carberry said when asked if the team wants to finish with the best record. “We’ve talked about it. … You’re searching as coaches and the players too. You want to find things that you are playing for at this time of year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2NhcGl0YWxzLXJlY2FsbC16YWNoLWZ1Y2FsZS1mcm9tLWFobC1oZXJzaGV5L9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vbm92YWNhcHNmYW5zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2NhcGl0YWxzLXJlY2FsbC16YWNoLWZ1Y2FsZS1mcm9tLWFobC1oZXJzaGV5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitals Recall Zach Fucale From AHL Hershey,"Photo: NHL.com

The Washington Capitals announced on Sunday that they have recalled goaltender Zach Fucale from the AHL’s Hershey Bears after Vitek Vanecek left the team’s 3-2 overtime victory over the Boston Bruins with a lower-body injury and did not return.

In 11 games this season the 25-year-old went 9-2-0 with a .932 save percentage a 1.80 goals-against average and a shutout.

The Montreal Canadiens drafted him 36th overall in 2013 and signed a one-year two-way contract with the Capitals on August 19. He made stops with the Vegas Golden Knights and Tampa Bay Lightning in the past two seasons.

Fucale has yet to play an NHL game in his career. More on Fucale here.

Goaltender Ilya Samsonov came off of COVID-19 protocol on Saturday and skated during the Capitals’ optional practice on Sunday. He will likely need a few practice days before being able to suit up for game action though.

Goaltender Craig Anderson made 21 saves on 22 shots in relief after taking over the net in Game 1.

(Bloomberg) — The Environmental Protection Agency ordered the shutdown of a U.S. Virgin Island refinery that historically was positioned as a key fuel source for the East Coast due to public health concerns.

The 200000-barrel-a-day Limetree Bay refinery in St. Croix is required to pause operations after repeated operational infractions according to the EPA. Since February the facility has experienced major operational issues culminating with an incident earlier this week that forced its owners to shut the plant after it spewed oil droplets on nearby communities and contaminated drinking water.

“These repeated incidents at the refinery have been and remain totally unacceptable” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “This already overburdened community has suffered through at least four recent incidents that have occurred at the facility and each had an immediate and significant health impact on people and their property.”

The shutdown of the refinery comes days after a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline exposed how reliant the U.S. East Coast has become on a single pipeline for gasoline and diesel. The location of Caribbean refinery is ideal to quickly and cheaply move fuel to the Atlantic Coast as shipments from the U.S. Virgin Islands are exempt from the Jones Act meaning foreign ships can transport gasoline and diesel domestically without a waiver.

The EPA had been monitoring the growing list of incidents at the Limetree Bay refinery which is located in a community that is disproportionately affected by environmental burdens. Those mishaps have raised significant environmental justice concerns which are a priority the agency said in its statement Friday.

The agency ordered Limetree Bay to seek an independent audit of operations and then submit a plan for approval that addresses the auditors’ recommendations for corrective measures.

Known formerly as Hovensa the St. Croix refinery was previously owned by Hess Corp. and Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA before it was shuttered in 2012. Its current owners include ArcLight Capital Partners Freepoint Commodities and EIG Global Energy Partners.

In an emailed statement a company spokesperson said Limetree Bay voluntarily shut down the refinery on Wednesday after a flaring incident caused by an upset at a coker unit. The company’s focus is on investigating and cleaning up areas of the community affected by the incident and will cooperate fully with the EPA’s order. “We are committed to operating a safe facility.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hilton Head Island is unique among American vacation destinations in that it has a wide appeal to multiple generations. Spend your days at one of the many wide pristine beaches ride bicycles around the island with the whole family and then indulge in cocktails and coastal cuisine at one of the about 250 restaurants the 12-mile island has to offer.

Whatever you like to do on vacation chances are Hilton Head has it -- let's take a look at how the island offers something for every kind of traveler.

It's easy to get to

Hilton Head Island is located on the southeast coast of South Carolina about 30 miles from Savannah Georgia and 45 minutes from the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV) which is served by most major U.S. carriers from multiple hubs around the country. The island has its own airport too which has seen a surge in service from major carriers throughout the last year.

Hilton Head's geography also makes it an appealing destination to drive to -- especially for those who live in the eastern half of the country. The drive can easily be done in a day from major East Coast cities like New York Philadelphia and Washington D.C. and much less of course if you're based in major cities in the Southeast like Atlanta or Charlotte.

Accommodations are plentiful

If you're traveling with the whole family consider a vacation home rental. Hilton Head Island's website offers special deals and packages on rentals.

If a full-service resort is more your speed Hilton Head Island offers more than 20 hotels inns and resorts.

History is all around you

This island has a fascinating history. For more than 300 years the Gullah ancient culture continues to remain a vibrant thread in the fabric of Hilton Head Island life. Their influence on the area can still be seen today in the Gullah language (a creole similar to Sierra Leone Krio) African names their African folktales and craft items. Much of the Lowcountry's beloved food culture also originated with the Gullah — rice purlo okra gumbo shrimp and gravy cooked with spices and time-honored African cooking methods.

Historic Mitchelville located on Hilton Head's Port Royal Sound was America's first self-governed town of freed slaves. Established in 1862 by General Ormsby Mitchel the commander of the Union forces that occupied Hilton Head Island the town was built by and for those granted their freedom before the Emancipation Proclamation in the Port Royal Experiment. Gullah people direct descendants of Mitchelville continue to tell their story through the Mitchelville Freedom Park and the Mitchelville Preservation Project.

Bottom line

Whatever your idea for a good vacation Hilton Head has it. The island offers easy access and plentiful lodging options for every budget and type of traveler (or group of travelers) coupled with natural beauty and rich cultural heritage.

Whether you want to simply get away to a sunny destination for a few days or spend several weeks with the whole family exploring all the island and surrounding area has to offer you can't go wrong with a vacation on Hilton Head.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2hvdGVscy1yZXNvcnRzL2hvdGVsLWJyYW5kcy1wcml2YXRlLXZhY2F0aW9uLXJlbnRhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotel Brands Offering Private Vacation Rentals This Summer,"Back in 2017 executives at Marriott International realized they had a problem. Hotel guests tended to look elsewhere when it came time to plan family reunions getaways with friends and other group trips. Even die-hard members of Marriott Bonvoy the hotel's popular loyalty program would end up booking on sites like Vrbo which offered bigger places to stay with full kitchens private pools and other family-friendly comforts.

""We knew we could do it better"" recalls Jennifer Hsieh a vice president at Marriott. Over the next two years her team partnered with home-management companies around the world — ACME House Co. Natural Retreats and Paradise in Hawaii among others — to build a portfolio of 25000 homes in dozens of countries called Homes & Villas by Marriott International.

All come with pro-level cleaning and hotel-caliber amenities plus the benefit of allowing guests to earn and redeem points on stays. ""Members have redeemed billions of points since we launched"" Hsieh says on homes like the Palm Springs four-bedroom built for Frank Sinatra (one guest booked it for 2 million points) and a Modernist escape overlooking the slopes in Big Sky Montana (where a traveler dropped 4.8 million points on a multi-week stay).

Even so the hotel-affiliated vacation villa has sailed under the radar until recently when the pandemic made private homes even more desirable. Now the concept is catching on — as evidenced by Accor which unveiled its own Apartments & Villas last December with 50000 places to stay in hundreds of cities. The massive selection includes completely private home and villa rentals through OneFineStay a once-boutique rental firm that Accor acquired in 2016; on-property residences at hotels operated by Banyan Tree Delano Fairmont Raffles and SLS; and oversize suites at extended-stay brands Adagio and Mantra.

The hotel residences are particularly popular according to Jeff Tisdall a senior vice president at Accor. ""We have more than 30 branded private residences already and 80 additional projects under development"" he says.

The booming demand has even spurred non-hotel companies to get into villa rentals. Seattle-based TCS World Travel is best known for its private-jet journeys often run on behalf of clients such as Four Seasons. In October the firm debuted TCS Private Homes Plus which rents residences in the U.S. and Mexico. Each comes with prearranged itineraries of as many (or as few) experiences as guests want whether hot-air ballooning over the ruins of Mexico's Chichén Itzá or riding in a horse-drawn sleigh in Jackson Hole Wyoming.

Not that tried-and-true vacation-rental firms are standing still.

To this day the couple remain underneath the tarmac after their great-grandchildren negotiated with the federal government to have their graves remain in place when a runway expansion project during World War II required construction in an area where Dotson family members had been buried according to the airport's website.

The graves of two other Dotson family relatives Daniel Hueston and John Dotson can be found near the active runway.

According to The State a newspaper in South Carolina the airport was initially built on former farmland containing the Dotson family cemetery which housed approximately 100 graves — including those belonging to enslaved people.

When the airport expanded to accommodate the army Dotson decedents allowed most of the graves to be moved but wished that the family patriarch and matriarch — who died in the 1800s — be left undisturbed the outlet reported.

Eventually the family negotiated to have all but four graves were relocated to Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah according to the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport.

""These grave sites are the only ones in the world embedded in an active 9350 foot runway serving thousands of general and commercial aviation operations yearly"" the airport's website reads.

The marker of Richard's grave — which sits alongside his wife's burial plot on the runway's edge — reads ""At rest"" while Catherine's says ""Gone home to rest"" according to The State.

""Somehow the fact that they are still there resting in peace says something about the people who have been caretakers of this city for a long time"" Stan Deaton a senior historian for the Georgia Historical Society told local news station WTGS in 2018.

""If those people could rise up from that grave they would be bewildered by what they see around them."""

In full transparency the following was submitted to SOURCE via its wire service.

[broadstreet zone=”53820″]

MARLBOROUGH – Hologic announced this week its subsidiary Biotheranostics Inc. has received broader Medicare coverage for its Breast Cancer Index™ test under an expanded Medicare Local Coverage Determination.

Under the new criteria the Breast Cancer Index™ test is now covered for post-menopausal women diagnosed with early-stage node-positive (one to three axillary lymph nodes) non-relapsed estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive HER2 negative breast cancer to help physicians manage treatment of the patient.

Previously Medicare covered the test only for patients with node-negative non-relapsed ER and/or PR positive HER2 negative breast cancer. Therefore the expanded coverage increases the availability of Breast Cancer Index testing with no cost to Medicare beneficiaries who meet the LCD criteria.

[broadstreet zone=”59945″]

“Expansion of Medicare coverage for the Breast Cancer Index test and its recent inclusion in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are major milestones toward making the test standard of care for all early-stage HR+ breast cancer patients” said Kevin Thornal division president Diagnostic Solutions at Hologic.

For hormone receptor positive (HR+) post-menopausal breast cancer patients on extended endocrine therapy the side effects and toxicities of treatment often have significant negative effects on health and quality of life such as osteoporosis bone fractures and joint pain. As a result knowing when extended endocrine therapy will benefit a patient is as important as avoiding it when it will not make a difference. The Breast Cancer Index test can help personalize extended endocrine treatment for all HR+ early-stage patients.

The ratio of breast cancers diagnosed as node-negative or node-positive varies year to year but according to data published by the National Cancer Institute1 in 2021 approximately 85% of early-stage HR+ breast cancers were node-negative and 15% were node-positive that year. This means that approximately 25000 more women every year will be eligible for testing with Breast Cancer Index based on the expanded coverage.

[broadstreet zone=”59948″]

Breast Cancer Index™ is a molecular gene expression-based test uniquely positioned to provide information to help physicians individualize treatment decisions for patients with early-stage HR+ breast cancer. This breakthrough test helps oncologists and patients navigate the difficult trade-offs between taking steps to prevent recurrence of their disease and facing significant side effects and safety challenges related to unnecessary treatment.

Breast Cancer Index has guideline designation from the American Joint Committee on Cancer for cancer staging based on molecular profile. ASCO NCCN the European Group on Tumor Markers (EGTM) and St. Gallen acknowledge Breast Cancer Index as a biomarker to inform the chemotherapy decision; ASCO NCCN and EGTM to inform the extended endocrine treatment decision. It is the only validated commercially available test that predicts benefit from extended endocrine therapy.

Breast Cancer Index is intended for routine clinical use and treatment decisions based on results are the responsibility of the physician. It is a laboratory developed test (LDT) performed in a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited diagnostic laboratory and is not required to be cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug administration.

The average Athens resident might be at a Home Depot and see Vince Dooley the winningest coach in Georgia football history buying some plants. That same resident could then be driving around and see Ray Goff out for his daily seven-mile walk. A bit later they might spot Jim Donnan coming off the golf course. Then in the evening they might be driving near campus and see Mark Richt walking with his family in Five Points and hop out of the car to take a selfie.

That last thing actually happened by the way.

“He left his car running got the selfie then hopped right back in” Richt said.

If somehow this average Athens resident could track down Kirby Smart harder these days because he has the actual job they could say that they spotted every Georgia head football coach since 1964. Because they all through different circumstances still live here. That may say something about the town. Or it may just say something about the men themselves.

They don’t get together for breakfast or anything. Two of them – Richt and Smart – do text and call each other sometimes. Two of them – Donnan and Dooley – have had lunch on occasion. Goff is content to live a more solitary life keeping his distance from the program he loved too much to work anywhere else even after the painful ending.

They didn’t have great endings at UGA honestly. Three were fired. Dooley was forced into early retirement. But all came to peace with it for different reasons and on different timetables. And now they live the second act of their lives in the direct shadow of the first.

Vince Dooley (Georgia head coach from 1964-88)

“There’s everything you need here. If I had to make it most ideal I’d put it 20 miles closer to Atlanta. But no closer to that.”

The legend walks around freely and without entourage or ado. Dooley drops in at Georgia’s football facility enough whether picking up some mail or just visiting that nobody thinks much of it. He still came around in the years after his acrimonious departure. When his nemesis then-president Michael Adams retired in 2013 Dooley seemed to be around the building and the press box even more.

There had always been chances to leave. Dooley born and raised in Alabama came close to leaving for Auburn and Oklahoma but he didn’t and by the time he was done coaching he was the athletic director and by the time he was ousted from that role he was firmly established in Athens as was his family. There was no desire to go live at the beach.

“I just like living in a university town. It’s got so much to offer” said Dooley who turns 89 this September. “And I guess I got kind of used to it.”

Dooley stayed involved in the football business: He advised Kennesaw State when it started a football program driving about 90 minutes each way two or three times a week.

“I was really involved in it and thoroughly enjoyed it” Dooley said. “This was a program that had no history had never been in existence so I enjoyed that challenge and that opportunity.”

But off-field pursuits dominated. Even while he was coaching Dooley had other interests. He audited history courses as a student at Auburn and even as Georgia’s coach and athletic director. Then he retired — earlier than he wanted with that push from Georgia’s administration in 2004 — and Dooley threw himself into courses on military history. One course would lead to another: He would visit cities around the world and the museums made him interested in art history so he and Barbara took a course. He also took a course on horticulture the basics of identifying plants and trees and he became interested in that.

In fact the late Pat Dye — former coach at Auburn — and Dooley were both interested in Japanese maples and Dye had some so Dooley would stop at his house to look at those. And when Dye came to speak in Athens he would stop at Dooley’s house to look at his garden. Two college football legends just admiring some flowers.

Ray Goff (Georgia head coach from 1989-95)

“I know a lot of people would say ‘Why would you hang around Athens? You got fired.’ Well a lot of people get fired. It ain’t just sports. I tell them: ‘This is home.’”

Goff may be known to the outside world as the man who replaced Vince Dooley and got fired a cautionary tale. But he’s also a person a father a grandfather the guy you may see walking in your Athens neighborhood living the next three decades-plus of his life.

“I had given my heart and soul to Georgia. It didn’t work out” Goff said. “But that isn’t anybody’s fault but mine.”

That’s one of many self-deprecating comments you will hear from Goff. Another: “I’ve had nobody walk up to me and say ‘You’re an idiot.’ Even though I probably am.” Another on why he hasn’t attended a Georgia practice since he left: “They don’t need me at practice. They didn’t win (me) games.”

Actually he did win 46 games as the head coach and more as a player when he was the SEC Player of the Year in 1976. But he’ll be remembered most for his head coaching tenure and he knows and has come to peace with that because he’s made so much of his life since then.

There is the partnership with Zaxby’s where Goff got in early as a franchise owner. That’s been as lucrative as it has been enjoyable allowing Goff to travel around the state and get to know people. That’s one reason he never got back into coaching. But the main reason Goff says is he spent so much of his career telling recruits all the great things about Georgia that it would be hypocritical to take a job somewhere else.

“There were a lot of days that I wanted to leave” Goff said. “You don’t have the job that you used to. And the people you were around some of them wouldn’t be around you. They tried to just go somewhere else so to speak if you’re in a room. They wouldn’t come over and speak to you. Now that was some of them not all of them. If you’re at the top everybody wants to be your friend. But when you’re at the bottom you’ll find out who your friends are.”

These days he’s quite happy with his friends including Smart the 18-year-old he recruited to Georgia. Several of his assistants also still live in Athens: John Kasay Sr. Mac McWhorter Pat Hodgson and Dickie Clark.

And while Goff has never been back to a Georgia practice he goes to lettermen’s events and has been to plenty of games quietly purchasing a suite at Sanford Stadium which he shares with two other families. Goff had been to almost every game until 2020 when he stayed away because of COVID-19 He said he’s remained very cautious keeping mostly to himself.

But almost every day he goes on that seven-mile walk. Goff now 65 had a heart attack a few years ago and he makes a point to take care of himself. The daily walk often takes him to different neighborhoods and on the day he talked he happened upon the first house he bought in Athens after he was fired. He’s bought and sold two more since then and now lives alone in nearby Bishop alone and happy on a nice piece of land.

“It worked out” Goff said. “Everything worked out fine.”

Jim Donnan (Georgia head coach from 1996-2000)

“It’s a real proud feeling to me to know that I was the coach at Georgia and I felt like we did a lot of good things. There are some things that we didn’t get accomplished that I would have liked a chance to finish. But it’s still a big part of being involved in a program like Georgia.”

There was no long-term plan. When Donnan was let go by Georgia after the 2000 season he had been coaching since he was 21 years old and had never thought far ahead on where he wanted to settle. So he just stayed in Athens for what he thought may be a year.

It’s ended up being two decades. And counting.

Donnan had few if any connections to the town when he arrived as Georgia’s coach. He had been the head coach at Marshall and had been an assistant at six other schools in some great college towns: Tallahassee Norman Chapel Hill Manhattan Huntington. So he was perfectly at home in Athens and in no hurry to leave even if it meant watching someone else run the program he’d built the past five years.

Donnan didn’t expect to stay in Athens long after he finished coaching. But it’s been two decades and counting. (Photo: Jim Donnan)

“If you move to the beach or the mountains or something like that then have to move again I didn’t want to do that” said Donnan who along with his wife had made a lot of friends outside of football. “In the meantime I did have a couple offers a couple head job offers and some pro offers. But I felt like I’d been at this level of winning I didn’t feel like I wanted to go start over and resurrect somebody.”

Kentucky was interested in Donnan in 2002 after Guy Morris had left but at 10 p.m. one night Donnan decided to pass. Rich Brooks came in and did well with Kentucky but Donnan doesn’t sound like he has any regrets. Donnan stayed in the game by working with ESPN keeping him in the game. He enjoyed traveling out to Oklahoma to watch his grandson play in high school. They saw every game his senior year including the playoffs. So he was getting his football fix while also spending more time around his family.

“I spent more time with my grandchildren than I ever did with my children” he said.

Dooley and Donnan still have a good relationship despite the way it ended because Adams “was the one who pulled the trigger on me” as Donnan put it. He was invited to practices by Richt and then when Smart his former player got the head coaching job Donnan felt even more comfortable stopping by.

Donnan has also become a Georgia man when it comes to all sports. He formed relationships with coaches Jack Bauerle (swimming) Manny Diaz (men’s tennis) and Chris Haack (men’s golf) and was close with other people. So he’s become a follower of all sports including men’s and women’s basketball. Donnan who grew up watching basketball in North Carolina became a fan and ticket-holder to Georgia’s basketball and baseball teams. Few people know more about Georgia sports — football and otherwise — than Donnan.

As time went on Donnan and his family just never left. Athens afforded him a chance to play tennis and golf: He played an entire round with someone who didn’t know until it was over that he used to be Georgia’s head football coach.

“I never did really relish being in the limelight and it’s good being around a lot of people who just take you for who you are” he said.

Mark Richt (Georgia head coach from 2001-15)

“We didn’t lose any friends. We didn’t make many enemies here if any and didn’t burn many bridges if any. We were well-received in town by the Georgia people which is nice.”

Richt has a book coming out. “Make The Call” will be a memoir that covers mostly Richt’s coaching career at Florida State (as offensive coordinator) Georgia and Miami (as head coach) and will detail the hard decisions he had to make both on and off the field some that worked and some that didn’t. It will be released in late August in time for this football season.

I wrote my first book. It’s been on my heart for years now. It comes out late August. You can pre-order on the https://t.co/vztzjWsMQO website. A lot of great stories about football family and faith! My hope is that it will entertain you and bless you! pic.twitter.com/0KKTWvc2hz — Mark Richt (@MarkRicht) March 13 2021

“If you’re a football fan and you like the inside scoop on certain plays or moments you’d enjoy it” Richt said.

Moving back to Athens was not one of the hard decisions. There were no bitter feelings no psychological need to spend a few years away before coming back. He was already there at his departure press conference days before he took the Miami job. Three years later Richt retired from coaching and he and his wife Kathryn bought a condo in Destin Fla. He joined the ACC Network and tweeted about cheese puffs seeming to live the great life.

But the pull of family brought him back to Athens. During Richt’s coaching tenure so much of his family moved to Athens and never left: His mother. His father and his wife. His brother and his wife and three daughters. His sister who is married to former NFL quarterback Brad Johnson and their two children including Max an LSU quarterback. His other sister and her husband Kevin Hynes and their two children. Richt’s daughter Anya and his son Jon his wife and two children.

“It’s hard to leave the grand-babies” Richt said.

That kept pulling Richt and his wife back to Athens staying at least a week every month with Jon and his family. So they finally decided to move back. They had sold their old house back in 2016 so this time they bought a house closer to campus and have gotten in the habit of walking to Five Points maybe getting something to eat and running into plenty of people who recognize them.

It’s good to be back home near family. #AthensGa pic.twitter.com/WkoiZn6sz4 — Mark Richt (@MarkRicht) March 9 2021

They still have the condo in Destin and are splitting time between the two. Lately it’s been more in Athens just getting the new house in order. They’ve also enjoyed the reception they’ve gotten in town where time has made Georgia fans appreciate his tenure. Richt occasionally will be sent the charts showing the comparison between his first five years and Smart’s first five years which is actually more a compliment to Richt than anything.

“Obviously we started out well and didn’t finish as well as we started. But we still had quite a few 10-win seasons and all that good stuff” Richt said. “I get it I understand the business and we all sign up for it. I’m not bent out of shape at anybody. They did what they thought was best for the school and that’s okay with me. …

“We don’t look back and bemoan anything. We celebrate the life that we’ve had and the blessings that we’ve had. We’re thankful for the relationships we’ve gotten and the opportunity to make a difference in a lot of guy’s lives. It’s been good.”

One more

There technically is one former Georgia head coach without a house here: Bryan McClendon is in the program’s official books as a head coach after serving as the interim in between Richt and Smart. McClendon went 1-0 beating Penn State in the Gator Bowl (then known as the TaxSlayer Bowl) before going on to South Carolina and then Oregon where he is the receivers coach.

It’s more than just former Georgia head coaches who now call Athens home. Ricky Bustle who was Louisiana’s head coach from 2003-09 settled in town a few years ago when he married a professor at UGA. McWhorter the former Goff assistant was Georgia Tech’s head coach for a brief period after George O’Leary left. And of course there’s Will Muschamp the former Florida and South Carolina head coach now back at his alma mater where he’s a senior analyst for Smart.

“It’s a testimony to the university and Georgia and to Athens that you’d have all these head coaches that would like to stay here” Dooley said. “It’s a good place to live.”

Someday the five living Georgia coaches may all get together perhaps at a Georgia game. But schedules are hard to line up especially with Richt’s duties at the ACC Network. For now the connective tissue is more verbal such as when Richt explained why he invited his predecessor to practice.

“I wanted them to feel comfortable feel part of it” Richt said. “I mean obviously we benefitted greatly from the recruiting that coach Donnan had done.”

And it was pointed out Smart benefitted greatly from Richt’s recruiting.

“Yeah” he said. “It all works together.”

A day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines saying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in most places some stores dropped their mask requirements for customers. Walmart Costco Sam’s Club Publix and Trader Joe’s are just some of the big-name stores that have already made the change saying fully vaccinated people can go mask-free except where a mask is required by state or local mandates.

The stores still say unvaccinated people should wear masks. “In accordance with CDC guidelines individuals who are not fully vaccinated are required to use face coverings over their noses and mouths while inside any Publix store” the grocery store chain said in a statement for example. But really the change is just a blanket green light for anyone to shop without a mask because there is no way employees could corroborate the vaccination status of their customers. “We will not require proof of vaccination but we ask for members’ responsible and respectful cooperation with this revised policy” Costco said in a statement updating its mask policy. The stores are also allowing most vaccinated employees to go mask-free.

Even as some rushed to changed their policy other stores are taking a slower approach and have made clear they aren’t ready to change yet. Apple for example said that it will be keeping its mask requirements at its retail stores for now. Kroger the largest supermarket chain in the country also said it wasn’t changing its mask requirements for now as did Home Depot and Target. Walgreens also said it is keeping the mask mandate for now in part because its stores are “a destination for COVID vaccine and testing.”

Some have cautioned against being too eager to drop masks. Unions representing grocery store and retail workers said masks should still be required for now. The new CDC guideline “fails to consider how it will impact essential workers who face frequent exposure to individuals who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear masks” Marc Perrone president of United Food and Commercial Workers’ union said. Writing in the New York Times Zeynep Tufekci says that it isn’t clear why the CDC had such a major change of heart on masks so quickly. “The C.D.C. shift does not seem to fully account for the risks to the great number of unvaccinated people or the immunocompromised especially those working indoors” Dr. Tufekci writes."

12-Month Change

Gasoline prices have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The energy index rose 25.1% over the past 12 months boosted by gasoline (+49.6%) and natural gas (+12.1%). High energy prices roused mounting inflation worries throughout the financial markets.

Food-away-from-home recovered significantly since summer 2020 with a 3.8% gain. The limited-service-meals index which includes pickup take-out and delivery restaurants jumped 6.2%.

PPI rose 0.6% in April double market projections.

The pricing pressure in commodities (e.g. lumber steel corn etc.) can have a ripple effect throughout the supply chain. While some companies are passing along higher labor and materials costs to customers other may not have that flexibility. The NFIB small business optimism index shows that many small businesses remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for 2021.

(NYSE: HPQ) will begin shipping computer printers from Los Angeles to Phoenix on supervised autonomous semis from Embark Trucks. HP is the newest addition to a network of Embark is growing to better understand shipper needs.

In the beginning HP will move just one truck a week “with additional opportunities to expand as additional lanes and opportunities are identified” Jessica Kipp HP’s global head of logistics told FreightWaves. “We look forward to working with our logistics partners to develop innovative ways to accelerate the advancement of these types of technology.”

HP does not operate its own trucks but that’s OK with Embark which is trying to learn the needs of shippers and fleets while it focuses on software development.

Embark’s Partnership Development Program is the startup’s attempt to win adoption for its universal interface that works in trucks from the Big Four manufacturers — Daimler Volvo PACCAR and Navistar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGUtbGVhZGVyL25hbWUvbWFyeS10aG9tcHNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD05NjE4MTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Thompson Obituary (2021) - Canisteo NY - The Leader,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/the-leader/name/mary-thompson-obituary?id=9618107 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGUtbGVhZGVyL25hbWUvbWFyeS10aG9tcHNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD05NjE4MTA30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1dG9tb2JpbGktZXN0cmVtYXMtMjA0MC1ocC1mdWxtaW5lYS1oeXBlcmNhci1sb29rcy1ib25rZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automobili Estrema's 2040-HP Fulminea Hypercar Looks Bonkers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1dG9tb2JpbGktZXN0cmVtYXMtMjA0MC1ocC1mdWxtaW5lYS1oeXBlcmNhci1sb29rcy1ib25rZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ2VuZXJhbGF2aWF0aW9ubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNS9hbi1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWVuZ2luZS1mb3IteW91ci1jZXNzbmEtMTcyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An automotive engine for your Cessna 172? — General Aviation News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://generalaviationnews.com/2021/05/15/an-automotive-engine-for-your-cessna-172/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ2VuZXJhbGF2aWF0aW9ubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNS9hbi1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWVuZ2luZS1mb3IteW91ci1jZXNzbmEtMTcyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlsb3VuZ2UuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9yZXZpZXdzL2VudHJ5L2FwcGxlLWlwb2QtZnJvbS1ocC1pcG9kaHAtaXBvZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Apple iPod from HP (iPod+hp),"Pros: Still the best value iPods released to date with Apple’s best control scheme and extended (12 hour or more) battery life.

Cons: Click Wheel works a bit better than it looks new features besides battery and Click Wheel are largely trivial still no user-replaceable battery.

You’ve already seen our New Users’ and Power Users’ reviews of Apple’s fourth-generation iPod (iLounge rating: A-/B+). In order to address frequent questions from our readers we have added this new supplementary review of the Apple iPod from HP (iPod+hp) Hewlett-Packard’s co-branded and repackaged version of the fourth-generation iPod.

Though we won’t completely re-review the product which is virtually identical to the hardware we’ve already reviewed in the articles above we use this review to spotlight the differences between the Apple and HP versions of the fourth-generation iPod. Hopefully this article will put to rest questions such as “what’s the point of a HP-branded iPod?” “why would Apple (or HP) want to do that?” and “is there any real difference between the two pieces of hardware?”

Business Realities

The simple answer to the first two questions is this: Apple gains additional iPod distribution marketing resources and market presence from its iPod partnership with HP. In other words more stores carry iPods more television magazine and web advertisements mention the iPod name and more people wind up with iPods. Additionally as a result of the Apple-HP alliance iTunes now comes pre-installed on HP’s popular Windows PCs and HP got to do the legwork to make iTunes compatible with Microsoft’s Windows XP Media Center – the piece of software called HPTunes.

All of these assets plus additional cashflow and other behind-the-scenes details that are not immediately apparent are Apple’s benefits. From HP’s standpoint the choice to sell iPods has benefits as well. Rather than competing against the iPod and sharing 2-4% market share with the likes of Dell HP gets to share in potentially windfall profits and publicity from the industry’s leading music platform. It can also develop iPod-compatible accessories such as printable stickers and printers and enjoy immediate exposure from Apple if it desires. We’ll look at the first such product HP’s Printable Tattoos for the 4G iPod in a separate review.

The iPod+hp and You

Apple and HP aside consumers win as well – in some ways more than others. As you can see from our photo gallery the iPod+hp has its own packaging and instruction manuals geared exclusively towards the needs of PC users.

Each package now comes with a blue version of the iPod Windows software installer CD plus a few new manuals and inserts developed by HP: there’s a 67-page iPod+hp User’s Guide a 9-page Warranty and Support Guide an ad for HPshopping.com and the iTunes Music Store an insert that discusses manual errors regarding the Shuffle Songs feature and another titled Important Information that discusses what to do when the iPod doesn’t complete its startup process using the PC. The CD also includes a 32-page PDF called Tutorial with five extended lessons on using iTunes and the iPod. Finally there’s a HP-developed Quick Start poster in every box – it’s very simplistic and general with explanations of the iPod’s controls pack-ins and initial use. A multicolored wall poster image appears on its reverse side.

HP now also offers consumers an alternative to Apple’s customer support services. At almost the same time as HP’s release of the iPod+hp Apple changed its own iPod telephone customer support policy to permit only a single free help call per iPod purchased – a draconian decision to say the least. Apple iPod buyers additionally need to pay a $29.95 shipping and handling fee for all repairs handled six months after the iPod’s purchase. By contrast buyers of iPod+hp hardware get HP Total Care – a year of unlimited access to Hewlett Packard’s customer service hotline; while not as well-regarded as Apple’s this is a better option after your second problem than none at all. Better yet no ridiculous shipping and handling fees are applied for repairs during HP’s one-year warranty.

And then there’s the issue of off-the-shelf price. While both companies retail their iPods at around the same price (40 GB $399.00 (Apple) $399.99 (HP); 20GB $299.00 (Apple) $299.99 (HP)) HP’s iPods have been appearing at fairly significant discounts at online retailers since before they were released. With the exception of storewide coupons few retailers diverge from Apple’s own iPod prices and a $5 discount on an Apple iPod is unfortunately considered fairly aggressive. HP’s iPods have frequently appeared at discounts of $30-40 since their release and even as much as $50 off creating a better value for consumers since Apple’s and HP’s pack-ins are (other than manuals) the same.

Hardware Differences

The body of the iPod+hp is virtually identical to that of Apple’s own fourth-generation iPods. In footprint thickness colors controls screens and weight they’re the same. HP’s iPod however has a smaller iPod logo an additional HP Invent logo and a unique serial number (ten digits versus Apple’s eleven starting with a number rather than a letter). HP’s also lacks the iPod’s C-Tick logo which would show that the product complies with Australian standards for low electromagnetic (EMC) radio interference.

The text at the bottom of the two units differs as well. HP’s 40GB iPod reads:

Serial No.: JXXXXXXXXX

Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China MP000

Model: MP103 Product No. PE436A Rated 5-30Vdc 1.0A Max.

TM and (C) 2004 Apple Computer Inc. All rights reserved.

Apple’s 40GB iPod reads:

Serial No.: 2XXXXXXXXXX

Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China

Model No.: A1059 EMC No.: 1995 Rated 5-30Vdc 1.0A Max.

TM and (C) 2004 Apple Computer Inc. All rights reserved.

Other than their rear casings the units are identical down to the legal notices in their firmware: HP gets no billing even in the menus. And the 40GB unit we tested exhibits the same static and hard drive accessing audio defect we’ve heard in Apple’s standard fourth-generation iPods. So save for a slight cosmetic difference the Apple iPod from HP is just the same as Apple’s iPod from a hardware standpoint.

Installation and Software

Though iLounge largely uses Macs with its iPods these days we have previously noted that there are installation issues with the PC versions of iPod software – ones that previously could screw the iPod up a bit but now have been reduced to mere annoyances. Unfortunately those annoyances continue on the HP version of the iPod installation disc which is basically the same as Apple’s save for an occasional hint in small text that the CD was customized for HP and the inclusion of PDF versions of HP’s manuals.

We experienced the same iPod PC USB installation issues with the iPod+hp that we’ve experienced with older iPods – the need to format the iPod when it arrived the odd “your hardware has been detected but may not function properly” messages from Windows XP iTunes’ refusal to recognize the iPod when connected via USB and so on."

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

IBM has made a breakthrough in microchip technology: the world’s first 2-nanometer (nm) microchips.

Why this matters: Microchips are the brains of modern computers. They are used in almost every electronic device from smartphones to spacecraft.

Better microchips mean more powerful devices or ones that use less energy.

IBM predicts its 2-nm microchips will be able to provide devices with a 45% boost in processing performance compared to today’s common 7-nm microchips. Alternatively they could decrease a device’s energy consumption by 75%.

This means that our cell phones may only need to be charged every four days our computers could get faster and large scale data centers could drastically reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions. According to IBM if every data center switched to its new chips the savings would be enough to power 43 million homes.

The microchips could also help autonomous cars process visual information or give AIs the ability to analyze mountains of astronomical data more quickly facilitating space exploration efforts.

Truly anything that involves computers could become more powerful if packed with these next-gen microchips — and what doesn’t involve computers?

“There are not many technologies or technological breakthroughs that end up lifting all boats” Darío Gil senior VP and director of IBM Research told CNN. “This is an example of one.”

How it works: The way to increase a microchip’s performance is to increase the number of transistors packed onto it without increasing the chip’s size.

The iPhone 12’s industry leading 5-nm microchips have 11.8 billion transistors. That averages out to 134 million transistors per square millimeter.

IBM was able to fit 50 billion transistors onto the microchip the size of a fingernail (150 square millimeters). That’s 333 million transistors per square millimeter.

So what exactly are transistors?

Modern computing devices operate in binary code meaning everything they do is dictated by strings of 1s and 0s.

Transistors are like tiny faucets for computing devices only instead of water they control the flow of electricity. A transistor being open (with electricity flowing through it) represents a 1 in binary code while a closed transistor represents a 0.

More transistors means faster processing of 1s and 0s but we can’t just make bigger and bigger microchips to hold more and more transistors — the chips aren’t cheap to manufacture and the cost goes up with size.

If we can pack more transistors onto the same sized microchip though we get chips that are both more powerful and more energy efficient without dramatically increasing costs.

“In the end there’s transistors and everything else (in computing) relies on whether that transistor gets better or not” Gil told Reuters.

The cold water: Manufacturing of the 2-nm microchips isn’t expected to begin until 2024 or 2025 — so these chips won’t be able to help with the current global microchip shortage.

Right now there’s far more demand for chips than there is supply and the pandemic deserves the lion’s share of the blame for that situation.

About 80% of chips are made in Asia and the pandemic forced many of those facilities to temporarily shut down in early 2020. COVID-19 also affected the global supply chain and the silicon used for microchips became more scarce because it’s also used to make vaccine vials.

Everything else in computing relies on whether transistors get better or not.

Darío Gil

Automakers also thought the pandemic would have a bigger impact on sales than it did leading them to order too few of the chips needed for its vehicles. When sales rebounded they ran out.

Consumer tech companies meanwhile needed more microchips as their sales increased. People were buying more laptops to facilitate remote work and school — and more gaming consoles to make social distancing less boring.

As if a global pandemic wasn’t difficult enough to navigate the chip industry was also plagued by disaster in early 2021: a cold snap forced the closure of several Texas factories in February a Japanese factory caught fire in March and a drought in Taiwan affected factories there in April.

The annual chip conference is online only again this year but it seems like there will be quite a few very cool presentations. Here is the advanced schedule of the event.

CPU Section

Since we review a lot of CPUs on STH we are excited for these. Learning about the IBM mainframe parts with the next-generation Z(16) is always fun.

Intel Alder Lake CPU Architectures

AMD Next Generation “Zen 3” Core

The >5GHz next-generation IBM Z processor chip

Next-Gen Intel Xeon CPU – Sapphire Rapids

Two next-generation Intel parts as well as AMD Zen 3 (which we know a bit about already) make for a fun presentation.

Academic Spinout Chips

While the first group is largely the domain of major CPU providers the academic group shows projects that are often a bit further out.

Mozart: Designing for Software Maturity and the Next Paradigm for Chip Architectures – University of Wisconsin- Madison

Morpheus II: A RISC-V Security Extension for Protecting Vulnerable Software and Hardware – University of Michigan

These projects are probably not what you will be buying in the next year or two they are great showcases for the researchers and universities.

Infrastructure and Data Processors

For STH this is always a big area. We have covered the Arm Neoverse N2 and V1 at Arm Tech Day 2021 and have started showing off the NVIDIA DPUs.

Arm Neoverse N2: Arm’s second-generation high performance infrastructure CPUs and system products

NVIDIA DATA Center Processing Unit (DPU) Architecture

Intel’s Hyperscale-Ready SmartNIC for Infrastructure Processing

We have shown some of Intel’s FPGA SmartNIC C5020X combining FPGA and Intel Xeon D. Intel is resisting using the “DPU” terminology that other vendors such as NVIDIA Fungible Broadcom Marvell Pensando and others are using. We hope Intel aligns terminology by this event.

Enabling Technologies

Enabling technologies is an area where sometimes we get some really interesting presentations.

Heterogeneous computing to enable the highest level of safety in automotive systems – Infineon

Architecting an Open RISC-V 5G and AI SoC for Next Generation 5G Open Radio Access Network – EdgeQ

Aquabolt-XL: Samsung HBM2-PIM with in-memory processing for machine learning accelerators – Samsung

That Aquabolt-XL may be the one to watch for STH readers.

ML Inference for the Cloud

ML/ AI inference is a big area that is growing in terms of TAM. We have three pieces here:

Accelerating ML Recommendation with over a Thousand RISC-V/Tensor Processors on Esperanto’s ET-SoC-1 Chip

AI Compute Chip from Enflame

Qualcomm Cloud AI 100: 12 TOPs/W Scalable High Performance and Low Latency Deep Learning Inference Accelerator

This is an area ripe for a company to make a major move in since it seems like we have seen a shake-out in training startups.

ML and Computation Platforms

When we discuss those training platforms we have a number of presentations here as well.

Graphcore Colossus Mk2 IPU

The Multi-Million Core Multi-Wafer AI Cluster – Cerebras Systems

SambaNova SN10 RDU: Accelerating Software 2.0 with Dataflow

The Anton 3 ASIC: a Fire-Breathing Monster for Molecular Dynamics Simulations

It seems like this is where one wants to get a monsterous chip name or just call your presentation of “a Fire-Breathing Monster” to get attention. For STH this is another key area to watch.

Graphics and Video

Of course we review a lot of GPUs and have already covered AMD RDNA2 as well as the Google YouTube VCU for Warehouse-scale Video Acceleration.

Intel’s Ponte Vecchio GPU Architecture

AMD RDNA(TM) 2 Graphics Architecture

Google’s Video Coding Unit (VCU) Accelerator

Xilinx 7nm Edge Processors

There are going to be a lot of folks tuning in for the Ponte Vecchio GPU talk from Intel.

New Technologies

The new technologies segment covers some emerging areas.

Mojo Lens – AR Contact Lenses for Real People

World Largest Mobile Image Sensor with All Directional Phase Detection Auto Focus Function – Samsung Electronics

New Value Creation by Nano-Tactile Sensor Chip Exceeding our Fingertip Discrimination Ability – Kagawa University

The IonQ Trapped Ion Quantum Computer Architecture

Quantum computing and a Mojo Lens AR contact should be fun to just learn about.

Keynotes

There are a number of keynotes planned as well. Here is the basic outline.

Synopsys Keynote

Skydio Autonomy Engine: Enabling the Next Generation of Autonomous Flight

US Department of Energy (mention of AI here)

Hopefully we get more details on these keynotes as we get closer to the event.

Final Words

Expect some major coverage of Hot Chips again from STH. We pushed out a lot of content during the event last year and we will be covering a majority of these talks when the event happens.

As a quick note this is the program as of the time of this writing. Topics have been known to change in the past but we are excited for Hot Chips 33.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXRlY2gvdmFjY2luZS1zaG9ydGFnZS1zdHltaWVzLWl0LWNvcy1pbm9jdWxhdGlvbi1kcml2ZS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjY1OTA4NC5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tdGVjaC92YWNjaW5lLXNob3J0YWdlLXN0eW1pZXMtaXQtY29zLWlub2N1bGF0aW9uLWRyaXZlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjY1OTA4NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vaccine shortage stymies IT cos’ inoculation drive,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit IIT Delhi Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit

Some IT companies that had committed to help employees with immunisation drives are now looking to delay the programme because of vaccine shortage. IBM  which was supposed to start its vaccination programme this month has told its employees that it has been pushed back two people familiar with the matter said. The company has more than 1 lakh employees in the country.“We are in touch with our partners and the hospitals on a regular basis to assess the situation on ground and will open up vaccination for our employees in line with government regulations and basis the availability of vaccination at the earliest possible date.’’ Chaitanya Sreenivas HR head IBM India  toldTCS with close to 5 lakh employees worldwide is looking to procure doses via suppliers to ensure its staff and their family are covered. While the company did run some initial camps on a pilot basis vaccination on the original scale planned is still to commence a person familiar with the matter said.“We are setting up vaccination centres across the country in our offices and with our primary medical partner. To ensure a smooth experience a core team will work with hospitals and suppliers for procuring and administering vaccines across cities in India” TCS said. Wipro said towards the end of April they held the first vaccination camp for employees above the age of 45 in Bengaluru. A similar camp was held in Chennai.Industry body Nasscom in a letter to PM Narendra Modi earlier this week said that while the vaccine regime has been liberalised availability of it for the private sector continues to be challenging and urged the government to authorise emergency use of WHO-approved vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna . It also requested the government to allow Nasscom members to procure vaccines from Indian stocks. The industry employs 45 lakh people.",,,

Request Description How to Complete Reward

A Pup at Heart Stoutland's usually calm but sometimes it gets really excited and zooms all over the place! I hope you get to see it. Found near the Neo-One throw down a trail of at least two Fluffruit in order to entice Stoutland towards the middle of the camp. As you near the table by the stairs that lead inside the laboratory throw a Fluffruit at Trubbish and watch as it enhales the purple gas. As Eevee jumps off the table and starts moving towards the center of the camp create a trail of Fluffruit that will lead both Stoutland and Eevee together. As they become aware of each others presence throw an Illumina Orb at Stoutland and watch as Eevee is entertained by Stoutland's glow. After a moment be ready to snap a photo as Stoutland begins spinning around in circles. Campfire - Profile Icon

Say Hello to Your Neighbors A Starly came and greeted me the other day. I wonder if that means it wants to be my friend. As you near the shacks on the right side of the course throw some Fluffruit down by the patch of flowers. Here you will encounter Starly who will slowly begin eating the Fluffruit. As Starly finishes the first Fluffruit provide it with second. If you are successful Starly will eat the two Fluffruit and will start flapping its wings in excitement. Snap a photo of this moment to complete the request. - - -

A Cheeky Pose Hey I just saw a Cutiefly make the cutest pose! But it's such a tiny Pokemon I can't get a good picture... Not too far from the welcome sign you will spot a flower garden on your right. Throw an Illumina Orb at the Cutiefly hiding amongst the flowers while also playing a Melody. If done correctly snap a photo as Cutiefly holds its cheeks. Ribbon 1 - Sticker

Bunnelby Bursts Out Hey I heard Bunnelby can jump super high! Let's see who can get a photo of it doing one those mega-jumps first. To find Bunnelby look for the three holes that are found on the ground. As Bunnelby sticks his ears out of the hole immediately throw a Fluffruit at them followed by an Illumina Orb. If you're successful quickly snap a photo as Bunnelby leaps into the air. - - -

An Eevee Party Eevee sometimes gets together for some playtime with the other Pokemon! Ever seen it do that. Enter the Laboratory and locate Stoutland and Eevee sleeping by the TV. In order to wake the two Pokemon throw an Illumina Orb at them followed by several scans. Once awake scan the TV several times until two Cutiefly reveal themselves. Once revealed throw an Illumina Orb at them and watch as they begin to follow Eevee. Finally now that all the Pokemon are awake throw an Illumina Orb at Eevee and watch as the Pokemon eventually sits down and begins to sway back and forth while Illuminated - this is your opportunity to snap a photo! - - -

The Empty Room Huh? I just saw the professor outside but I keep hearing noisees from the second floor... I-i-is it haunted? Starting from the entrance side make your way around the course and take the alternate route through the laboratory. As you enter turn right and look towards the dark empty room above. Throw Fluffruit onto this floor until you hear noises coming from the area. This is a sign that you should have your camera ready as you'll capture an angry Meowth. Comic 4 - Frame

At Home in the Dark Hmmm... There's a Pokemon under the floor but it's too dark for me to see. I wonder how I can get it to come out. Wake Meowth - who can be found sleeping by the Neo-One - with some Fluffruit. Once Meowth is awake make a trail of Fluffruit that leads beneath the darkness of the nearby deck. As Meowth heads beneath the deck snap a photo of Rattata as it runs out and away from the camp. Bungalow - Profile Icon

Research Data Rescue Something's been draining the electricity from the lab. Think you can catch the culprit in the act? Starting by the Laboratory side use the alternate route and head inside the Lab. Now that you're inside you will want to look for Audino and Dedenne. Once located lure Dedenne towards the computer with Fluffruit and a snap a photo as they charge up their electrical power and shock the nearby computer. Monitor: Todd - Frame

Audino's Favorite Pastime Audino loves to dance If you want to catch one dancing on camera your best chance is probably when it's outside. On the entrance side of the course look for the small patch of flowers by the wooden deck. In these flowers you will find a Cutiefly. Feed it two Fluffruit - not at once - and then watch as it flies over to Audino. As it nears snap a photo as Audino excitedly begins to to dance and spin around. Speech Bubble 2 - Sticker

Borrowing Bravery You can often find Sudowoodo in that area. I'm not sure why though. Maybe you can take a look and find out! Starting by the entrance make your way through the course until you reach Sudowoodo who can be found not too far from the shacks. As Sudowoodo nears the Crystabloom in the area use an Illumina Orb on it. If you're successful Sudowoodo will catch the Illumina Phenomenon effect. As a result Sudowoodo will begin smiling and dancing which you will want to snap a photo of if you plan on completing the request. - - -",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9uZXctcG9rZW1vbi1zbmFwLWJlc3Qtd29yc3QtY291cnNlcy1yYW5rZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Pokemon Snap: Every Course Ranked,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9uZXctcG9rZW1vbi1zbmFwLWJlc3Qtd29yc3QtY291cnNlcy1yYW5rZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2dhbWVuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzI0MzYvbmV3LXBva2Vtb24tc25hcC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Pokemon Snap Review,"An expedition worth the extended wait

Like many gamers in their 30's I was addicted to Pokémon when it first crashed onto our shores. I couldn't get enough of the franchise. From the classic original entry in the series to the collectible card game I was hooked. One of the first big spin-offs of the series and therefore another title I invested many hours into was Pokémon Snap. The N64 release opened up the world of the series in a brand-new way by letting you take photos of wild Pokémon in a variety of settings. Despite the title's popularity though a direct follow-up surprisingly never arrived. That is until now with New Pokémon Snap.

Like its predecessor there's a reason as to why you have been summoned to take pictures. Instead of Professor Oak you will now be assisting Professor Mirror with his research in the Lental region. As a newcomer to the Laboratory of Ecological and Natural Sciences (L.E.N.S.) it will be up to you to ride out on the fancy new NEO-ONE vehicle in search of the perfect picture. While Professor Mirror wants you to fill out the Photodex with all the creatures in the region he is really interested in the phenomenon known as Illumina. This is a special kind of reaction between Pokémon and plant that produces a beautiful glow. As you gain more experience the team at L.E.N.S. will uncover more and more about this phenomenon.

The Pokémon series has never really been known for strong plotting and this one is no different. The mystery of Illumina is not an engaging one. It's something that is just there to drive the game forward and give you a reason to move to new locations. The team you work with at L.E.N.S. does a little to salvage things at least. Professor Mirror is an affable fellow and Rita his main assistant has a fun personality. It was nice to see Todd return from the original Snap as well even if the apprentice he brings along Phil is a real annoying sort. Regardless I didn't get much out of the plot here but again it serves its purpose of giving you forward direction.

Even considering this is a 22 years later sequel New Pokémon Snap is not much of a deviation from its predecessor. As a budding photographer you travel across the Lental region in search of prime photo opportunities. Instead of letting you walk freely around though you are confined to the NEO-ONE. An on-rails hovercraft the NEO-ONE is durable enough to travel from searing hot deserts to deep into the sea. You may be lacking in freedom to explore but having automatic transportation at least lets you focus on taking pictures. You'll need that concentration as well as there are hundreds of Pokémon in need of fresh portraits.

Your first ride out on the NEO-ONE is a simple one. It's designed for you to get acquainted with the camera as well as the speed of the vehicle itself. It's a bit of a leisurely ride and one that is perfect for snapping pics. After you finish your maiden voyage you'll then be introduced to the scoring rubric used for your pics. Each picture you take is initially placed on a scale of one to four stars. This is not a critique of the photo itself but rather what the Pokémon is doing in the shot. A shot of a Qwilfish puffed up in defense will carry a different star rating than one of it just minding its own business.

Once the picture has been sorted into its respective star class it will then be fully graded by Professor Mirror. There are five categories on which they are rated: Pose Size Direction Placement and Other Pokémon. All of these are self-explanatory so you should have a good idea of what constitutes a good shot when you take it. If you get a shot of a Torchic facing towards the camera and centered that will be graded higher than one of its behind as it runs away from you. The points you score from each photo take also plays an important role in advancing your skill level. At the end of each run all new points scored add to the research level of the area you were in. The higher the research level the more comfortable the Pokémon in that region will feel around you. This will open up better photo opportunities.

There are other ways of coaxing better behavior out of your subjects though. As you assist Professor Mirror with his research you'll gradually unlock new tools for getting stronger shots. You can throw a Fluffruit in the direction of a Pokémon to get a pic of them snacking. Or you can just beam them in the head with it. A Melody Player can be used to get a monster to dance or wake them up from a nap. And since it plays an important role in the plot Illumina Orbs can also be unlocked over time. These balls can be thrown at Crystabloom flowers to trigger a unique reaction. If timed correctly you could have the opportunity to get a four-star shot.

From a mechanics standpoint there's not a whole lot of depth to New Pokémon Snap. Since you rarely need to focus on steering the NEO-ONE the gameplay boils down to pointing and shooting. It's like a light-gun arcade shooter except instead of killing people you're taking pictures. With that said I'm not sure what Bandai Namco Studios could have done to give it more depth while also not ruining the experience. I feel that the title is as enjoyable as it is due to how little is in your control. The point of the title is to take pictures not explore an open-world region. By letting you focus on that specific task the game spotlights its strongest qualities.

At its best the title comes off as a rather unique puzzler. Once you have full access to all your tools you'll need to figure out the best ones to use for each Pokémon. Experimentation is key. You most often will not get great pics on your first run through a level. It's only on subsequent runs where you'll begin to piece together how to take the perfect shot. This of course leads to a good amount of grinding and repetition. Not only for just filling out the Photodex but also for unlocking new regions. The work needs to be put in and if that's not something that will appeal to you you may be turned off by the languid pace of the title.

As someone who has nostalgia for the original release I do think New Pokemon Snap justifies its price tag. Gamers with similar history to mine as well as fanatics of the franchise would likely share that opinion. There's no denying that this is a niche product at the end of the day. If you are a casual fan of the series or someone just looking for something to keep you busy on the Switch I'm not sure it will hold the same appeal. It does what it sets out to do rather well but that type of gameplay is not for everyone.

With plenty of beautiful locations to travel through New Pokémon Snap is splendid to look at. Each of the many Pokémon found on the expedition is animated wonderfully and have plenty of personality in their movements. Maybe it's because I have been stuck inside for the last year but the beaches and oceans of Lental have never looked more appealing. It has to be said though that the on-rails gameplay does help obscure the lack of detail in the levels. Perhaps most importantly the graphics don't hamper the performance of the title in any significant way. There's some minor lag when a Pokémon gets right in your face but nothing that will prevent you from taking a shot if need be.

It may have taken 22 years but New Pokémon Snap is a worthy follow-up the iconic original. The sequel holds onto the simplistic but enjoyable gameplay that delighted fans but adds just enough to keep it from feeling dated. The assortment of tools available for you to use let you experiment with what will generate the best photo opportunity. The fact that you must do a fair amount of grinding to make progress around the Lental region can be frustrating. Having to run through the same area a few times in a row can certainly be a drag. However if you are a big enough fan of the franchise you probably wouldn't mind this anyway. This spin-off may not be enough to get this lapsed fan fully back into the Pokémon fold but it was certainly a nice trip down memory lane.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcG9rZW1vbi1zbmFwLWNvbXBsZXRlLXF1YWtpbmctdm9sY2Fuby1yZXF1ZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to complete A Quaking Volcano request in New Pokémon Snap,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcG9rZW1vbi1zbmFwLWNvbXBsZXRlLXF1YWtpbmctdm9sY2Fuby1yZXF1ZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbmludGVuZG9zb3VwLmNvbS9jb3JvY29yby1ob2xkaW5nLW5ldy1wb2tlbW9uLXNuYXAtcGhvdG8tY29udGVzdC1pbi1qYXBhbi1wcml6ZXMtaW5jbHVkZS10aGVtZWQtc3dpdGNoLWNvbnNvbGUv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9uaW50ZW5kb3NvdXAuY29tL2Nvcm9jb3JvLWhvbGRpbmctbmV3LXBva2Vtb24tc25hcC1waG90by1jb250ZXN0LWluLWphcGFuLXByaXplcy1pbmNsdWRlLXRoZW1lZC1zd2l0Y2gtY29uc29sZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CoroCoro Holding New Pokémon Snap Photo Contest In Japan Prizes Include Themed Switch Console,"Japanese magazine Corocoro has announced a photo contest for New Pokemon Snap with a chance to win a unique Nintendo Switch console.

Surprisingly AMD doesn't have a modern chip to fend off the 11400 so it squares off with AMD's two-year-old $199 Ryzen 5 3600 that isn't competitive with the 11400 in gaming. That makes for a one-sided battle leaving Intel to reign uncontested in the entry-level PC gaming market and earning the Core i5-11400 a spot on our list of Best CPUs.



After several years of heated competition the $150 to $200 price range now delivers incredible value with six-core twelve-thread models from both AMD and Intel in a segment where quad-core chips used to dominate. However AMD has largely abandoned delivering new products for this price bracket instead focusing on building out its premium lineup with a Ryzen-refresh XT series last year that didn't address the sub-$250 market. AMD followed with the Ryzen 5000 series with an incredibly steep $300 price of entry with the beastly Ryzen 5 5600X again not refreshing its sub-$200 lineup.



That leaves the Zen 2-powered Ryzen 5 3600 to soldier on as the premiere AMD competitor in this segment even though it debuted nearly two years ago. Unfortunately for AMD the company has grappled with supply issues due to the pandemic and unprecedented demand. That means the aging Ryzen 5 3600 is also hard to find anywhere near acceptable pricing.



Intel's Rocket Lake launch brought the company's first new architecture in six years to the desktop PC. Still the burden of the aging 14nm process proved to be too much for the highest-end Rocket Lake models leaving them inadequately equipped against AMD's core-heavy Ryzen 5000 flagships. However the new Cypress Cove architecture does grant a 19% IPC increase and the ultra-mature 14nm process also hits high boost clocks (albeit at the expense of power consumption) allowing the Rocket chips to rival AMD's finest in single-threaded work.

As a result Rocket Lake is generally competitive with Ryzen 5000 chips with the same number of cores. Intel's pricing is also aggressive leading to unexpectedly good deals for Intel's mainstream chips. But while the Core i5-11600K is an attractive chip its $262 price point is a bit steep for more value-conscious buyers especially because the ongoing GPU shortage means they'll need to dedicate more of their budget to a graphics solution.



Given what you'll see in our testing below the Core i5-11400 is unquestionably the best entry-level gaming chip on the market particularly when paired with a B-series motherboard. In fact if you aren't interested in overclocking to the extreme the Core i5-11400 is also a far better deal than the Core i5-11600K. You won't be able to overclock the 11400's cores or graphics like you can with the 11600K and you'll lose some of the 11600K's peak frequency headroom due to the 11400's lower 65W TDP rating but you'll gain an extra $80 that you can spend on other additives like a graphics card.



Despite its seemingly-low frequency range the Core i5-11400 still beats all comparably-priced CPUs. It can easily push along most graphics cards on the market especially at heightened resolutions and fidelity settings and Intel also added support for memory overclocking to B-series motherboards for all SKUs. As we'll show below you can also toggle a few power settings in the BIOS to get a sizeable overclock-esque boost for threaded workloads.



AMD desperately needs a Zen 3 chip in this price bracket to be competitive but it's hamstrung with Zen 2 processors for now. AMD won't have an answer to the Core i5-11400 until it releases its non-X version of the 5600X to retail or maybe a souped-up Ryzen 3 model that you can actually buy (unlike the mythical 3300X). Even AMD's Ryzen 5000G 'Cezanne' APUs might make some sense in this price bracket given the crushing graphics card shortages. Those chips aren't even available yet though because AMD has restricted them to the OEM market until later this year.



All of this means that for now AMD has completely ceded the entry-level mainstream gaming segment to Intel. Let's see how the tables have turned.

Intel Core i5-11400 Specifications and Pricing

We've covered the Rocket Lake family in-depth in our launch-day review so head there for finer-grained details of the architecture and broader product family. Intel spreads the Rocket Lake (RKL-S) chips across the familiar Core i9 i7 and i5 families but Comet Lake Refresh (CML-R) chips step in for Core i3 and Pentium. Those chips feature the same architecture as other Comet Lake chips but come with slightly increased clock speeds. You can learn more about them here.



Intel's chip frequencies have become a confusing array of four different flavors of Turbo Boost many with both single- and multi-core ratios that differ based on each family of chips. We've narrowed these listings down to the peak boost frequencies in the table below with each indicating the peak boosting tech used. You can find more information on Rocket Lake's boost tech and a more expansive listing of all the frequencies here.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Intel 11th-Gen Core Rocket Lake-S Specifications and Pricing Row 0 - Cell 0 Suggested Price Cores / Threads Base (GHz) Peak Boost (Dual/All Core) TDP iGPU L3 Ryzen 7 5800X $449 8 / 16 3.8 4.7 105W None 32MB (1x32) RKL-S Core i7-11700K (KF) $399 (K) - $374 (KF) 8 / 16 3.6 5.0 (TB3) / 4.6 125W UHD Graphics 750 Xe 32EU 16MB Ryzen 5 5600X $299 6 / 12 3.7 4.6 65W None 32MB (1x32) RKL-S Core i5-11600K (KF) $262 (K) - $237(KF) 6 / 12 3.9 4.9 (TB2) / 4.6 125W UHD Graphics 750 Xe 32EU 12MB RKL-S Core i5-11400 (F) $182 - $157 6 / 12 2.6 4.4 (TB2) / 4.2 65W UHD Graphics 750 Xe 24EU 12MB CML-S Core i5-10400 $182 6 / 12 2.9 4.3 65W UHD Graphics 630 12MB Ryzen 5 3600 $200 6 / 12 3.6 4.2 65W N/A 3MB CML-R Core i3-10325 $154 4 / 8 3.9 4.7 / 4.5 65W UHD Graphics 630 8MB

Rocket's newest boost tech doesn't apply to the Core i5-11400 — the chip merely tops out at a 4.4 GHz turbo on one core and 4.2 GHz on all cores with Intel's Turbo Boost 2.0 (TB2) technology which is the company's most basic and straightforward boost mechanism. Provided you give the chip adequate cooling (technically the stock cooler is adequate) and power you should be able to hit these boost frequencies.



The Core i5-11400 comes with a 65W PL1 (base frequency-TDP) rating and a 154W PL2 (power during boost) rating which is considerably better than the 11600K's 125W PL1 and 251W PL2. That means the chip will generate far less heat than the pricier overclockable model but that requires stepping down from a 3.9 GHz base frequency with the 11600K to the 11400's 2.6 GHz not to mention losing 500 MHz of peak boost frequency.



All of these same rules apply to the Core i5-11400F except it comes without the integrated UHD Graphics 750 Xe engine with 32EUs that you'll find on the standard 11400 model. Aside from losing QuickSync capabilities or the ability to use the iGPU as a backup solution sacrificing the integrated graphics units won't mean much to the overwhelming majority of gamers shopping in this price range. However you get a $25 discount for forgoing graphics and at $157 the Core i5-11400F is an amazing value.



The Core i5-11400 comes with a stock cooler but as with all Intel coolers it's a flimsy affair that most enthusiasts should plan on replacing. As we'll outline below the cooler is adequate if you run the chip strictly within Intel's recommended power guidelines but the chip runs faster with a more capable cooler. You also shouldn't plan on removing power limits if you're using the stock cooler.



As with the rest of the Rocket Lake lineup the 11400 supports 20 lanes of PCIe 4.0 with four dedicated to one M.2 slot. However the chipset still remains on PCIe 3.0 so you'll only find support for a single M.2 slot on 500-series motherboards. That still a solid step up from the PCIe 3.0 interface with the previous-gen Comet Lake processors. PCIe support can be a bit tricky with the Rocket Lake chips especially given that most of them also drop into 400-series motherboards with varying trade-offs. We have a breakdown in the motherboard section here.



Intel has stepped forward from DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200 but the company also introduced a new paradigm with Rocket Lake: Only the Core i9 chips support DDR4-3200 in an optimal configuration at stock settings. This setting is called 'Gear 1' and signifies that the memory controller and memory operate at the same frequency (1:1) thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work like gaming.

All other Rocket Lake chips including the Core i5-11400 only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates. This can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications — particularly gaming. We have yet to see a situation where Gear 2 makes much sense for enthusiasts. Instead this setting is most useful for those chasing overclocking frequency records that don't equate to real-world performance boosts.

The official top speed for the Gear 1 setting is DDR4-2933 for all Core i7 and i5 chips and running DDR4-3200 in lower-latency Gear 1 mode is considered overclocking. If you plan to run the Core i5-11400 at DDR4-3200 you'll have to use the Gear 2 setting if you want to stay within the strict confines of the warranty. That said Intel isn't known for harsh memory overclocking restrictions when processing returns but running memory beyond the spec does technically void your warranty. We've found that Gear 1 provides the best all-around performance so that's all you'll see in our testing.

We are so far into the digital transformation of our daily lives that we don’t even notice the magic of search anymore. When was the last time you heard someone remark how fast Google is or how relevant the first page of results returned was? Or how quickly your phone’s apps can find you a driver take-out or the right restaurant? Search is now part of everyday life – always available always reliable and always fast.

Unfortunately this is not the experience when law enforcement officers go to work. The seamless fast accessible experience of our home life seems eons ahead of what we experience when logging into our multiple law enforcement systems. When everything is disconnected swiveling from one system to the next or to another machine is the norm. The integration glue is often the Post-it note where we attempt to perform linking and matching gymnastics scratching our suspecting linking data down on paper and retyping into multiple systems.

Beyond the ability to integrate multiple systems there a number of reasons why search is now so important in 2021.

DATA DEMOCRATIZATION

The old saying “knowledge is power” has never been more relevant. In the drive to improve how law enforcement officers serve their communities unlocking institutional knowledge is essential.

Getting a complete search capability onto a secure mobile device will help any number of day-to-day policing interactions. Freeing data from being the sole preserve of the specialist analyst gives beat cops increased insight into the people they interact with on a daily basis improving the quality of interactions for all concerned.

SAFETY

Search can play a large role in law enforcement staff safety. This is accomplished by giving the officer a complete situational read before engaging with a citizen including highlighting the individual’s previously unknown relationship or suspected alliances.

The ability to have a full situational picture may well prompt a different course of action – a call for backup a different approach a change of tactics and language. How many times have people said in hindsight that the information was there we just didn’t join the dots in time?

INVESTIGATIVE EFFICIENCY

In our current fiscal environment efficiency needs to be looked at in all areas of policing and none more so than investigative processes.

Disconnected uncoordinated data creates massive inefficiencies and wastes resources. Having an effective search service across all possible sources is essential. Imagine the capabilities gained by connecting 911 calls complaints arrests CAD and RMS data parole and public records video images and open-source data.

Without an efficient search service the collection process can be onerous and never-ending. If your search can use artificial intelligence tools like entity resolution and natural language processing to highlight non-obvious relationships then you can deliver massive operational efficiencies.

EXPLOITING NEW DATA OPPORTUNITIES

In almost every industry the mantras of “we are a data-driven organization” and “data is an untapped asset for our organization” are ubiquitous. Law enforcement is no exception. And there are unique opportunities to exploit data in law enforcement.

In the past classified data was everything. Now more organizations are looking to exploit open sources such as the internet social media and the dark web. How do you link integrate and exploit these valuable sources for use in day-to-day policing work? Search is how these sources become part of the day-to-day workflow.

The non-search-based technologies of the past make this exploitation just too hard and expensive to contemplate. Any benefit was impossible because the cost of onboarding and linking were prohibitively expensive. Not with search!

STAFF TRAINING & RETENTION

The next generation of law enforcement officers has grown up with search. All the data they want in their lives is easily and quickly available on apps tablets and TVs. They have a very high expectation of how IT works. And when they arrive to work in law enforcement they do not expect the sometimes-archaic way of accessing data.

A common search capability across all data is essential to making onboarding training and retention run smoothly for younger employees. Their expectation levels for IT systems usability and performance are just different from older generations. They have no patience for substandard user experiences and are not afraid to express these opinions.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

Another catchphrase across industries is digital transformation. A widely held definition of digital transformation is “the adoption of digital technology to transform services or businesses through replacing non-digital or manual processes with digital processes or replacing older digital technology with newer digital technology.” Sounds good! And the key to digital transformation in law enforcement is getting the right information to the right person at the right time in a controlled way.

Law enforcement must maintain impeccable standards of security access control audit and justification on data access. Any digital transformation initiative without a search strategy is destined for failure given the importance of data to such transformations and the importance of compliance and control in this domain.

Confidence within most organizations will continue to grow when data is secured at the right level with strong audit and search justification requirements. But digital transformation within law enforcement is different. It requires a high level of understanding of the control and compliance requirements. Without that confidence can evaporate quickly and staff will revert to what they know even if it is suboptimal.

WHY NOW FOR SEARCH?

With the plethora of demands for spending within law enforcement across all sorts of technologies and cost-cutting agendas why is now the time to think about search? From an IT perspective I believe search makes the biggest impact in the shortest amount of time.

It is not the long-running Holy Grail project of a new central database data warehouse or a five-year program. Search respects the data you have today wherever and however it is stored and managed in whatever format. It allows you to use all sources quickly and answer the following: What do I have today? Where is it? Is it useful to the frontline? How do I access it quickly?

Search does not need to be a long drawn-out process to get search operational. In a recent project my company worked with a large law enforcement agency where we loaded linked secured and made available simple search and complex link-analysis search across 12 data sources and 97 million records in four weeks.

With no common person records database or person number we were able to build a virtual person identifier across all 12 sources. This intelligence makes search really sing in a law enforcement environment. We have to assume dirty unrelated data with no common keys and person IDs. It’s a fact of life in organizations that have grown organically over such a long time.

CONCLUSION

Search can be made available to the most advanced and most novice data consumers all within the constraints of audit and compliance laws and regulations pertaining to data. Classified open and commercial sources come together to make today’s law enforcement offices more data-aware and better equipped than ever before. By using search law enforcement can greatly enhance the possibilities for keeping people assets and networks safe.

Multiple international media organizations were reportedly based in the Al-Jalaa tower among them AP and Al Jazeera. Occupants were reportedly notified to evacuate an hour before the building was attacked by Israeli airstrikes in a retaliatory attack against the militant group.

The Israeli Defense Forces in a statement said that the high rise was targeted because it was being used by Hamas military intelligence. AP condemned Israel for the attack and claimed to have ""no indication"" that the U.S. designated terrorist organization operated from the building.

ISRAEL STRIKES TOPPLE BUILDINGS IN GAZA CITY

""We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building"" AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said in a statement. ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.""

Pruitt described the news agency as ""shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP’s bureau and other news organizations in Gaza.

But a 2014 piece from the Atlantic written by a reporter in the region detailed a long and questionable history between the AP and the jihadist group critics observed.

""When Hamas’s leaders surveyed their assets before this summer’s round of fighting they knew that among those assets was the international press. The AP staff in Gaza City would witness a rocket launch right beside their office endangering reporters and other civilians nearby—and the AP wouldn’t report it"" the article reads.

The journalist at the time claimed that Hamas fighters would regularly ""burst into the AP’s Gaza bureau and threaten the staff—and the AP wouldn’t report it.""

""@AP didn’t know about sharing a building w/ Hamas for 15 years?!?"" one Twitter user responded alongside an excerpt from the Atlantic story.

""Doesn't say much for their reporting abilities if they missed a Hamas staging office a floor away"" another tweeted.

Users found it ironic that AP journalists claim to be ""professional news making people but we also don't know that a designated terror organization shares a bathroom with us.""

""Difficult to believe this crew turned out to be renting office space in a Hamas building"" Sen. Ted Cruz's R-Texas national security adviser concurred.

Free Beacon contributor Noah Pollack said he ""Spoke to a well-placed friend in the IDF just now. The bombed AP office building contained multiple Hamas operations & offices including weapons manufacturing and military intelligence. The building also housed an Islamic Jihad office. And AP's local reporters knew about it.""

""This is an odd way of confessing that you're a completely inept news organization"" a Twitter user responded.

The IDF reportedly provided the Biden administration with ""smoking gun"" evidence on Sunday proving that Palestinian terrorists were operating from within the building.

""Israel shared intelligence with the US showing how Hamas operated inside the same building with Associated Press and Al-Jazeera in Gaza"" The Jerusalem Post reported .

""We showed them the smoking gun proving Hamas worked out of that building"" a source close to Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told The Jerusalem Post. ""I understand they found the explanation satisfactory.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvZGlnaXRhbGZvdW5kcnktMjAyMS1pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk5LTExOTAway1pNS0xMTYwMGstcmV2aWV3P3BhZ2U9NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Core i9 11900K and Core i5 11600K: Intel Adaptive Boost analysis,"One of the more interesting features of the Core i9 11900K is a feature that was announced after the chip was shipped to reviewers Intel Adaptive Boost or ABT. The idea is to offer a frequency bump to all of the cores that wouldn't have already been boosted by technologies like Thermal Velocity Boost and Turbo Boost Max 3.0 which target the best-performing cores. That helps in situations where many cores are loaded such as content creation workloads but is less impactful in scenarios like games where the performance of a smaller number of cores are the limiting factor.

We're not talking a massive overclock here - the boost is up to +300MHz on two cores +200MHz on two more and +100MHz on the final two in the illustration that Intel provided - but it does mean that the Core i9 11900K should be able to run at an all-core frequency of 5.1GHz if power and temperature numbers are within a healthy range. We wanted to see if that made a noticeable difference to gaming or content creation performance so we performed a quick trio of game tests and our content creation benchmarks. We also ran our content creation workloads with multi-core enhancement disabled to see how much of a difference staying within Intel's power limits made to our results as well.

So in content creation we see a nearly 19 per cent performance advantage for the 11900K by enabling MCE (which is essentially asking the motherboard to ignore Intel's turbo limit guidelines). There's a further four per cent boost in Cinebench R20 and HEVC by turning on ABT which also results in the highest power usage we've ever seen: 390W. (Meanwhile the 11600K sees nearly no advantage from enabling MCE in Cinebench but does gain 14 per cent in the Handbrake h.264 encode.) If your power supply and cooling solutions are a little bit stronger than you really need then this might be a good way of exchanging some of that headroom for a small performance advantage.

CB R20 1T CB R20 MT HB h.264 HB HEVC HEVC Power Use i9 11900K (MCE disabled) 638 5568 33.42fps 15.96fps 313W i9 11900K (MCE enabled ABT disabled) 642 5947 42.71fps 18.94fps 316W i9 11900K (MCE + ABT enabled) 636 6209 42.92fps 19.60fps 390W i5 11600K (MCE disabled) 590 4325 27.17fps 13.21fps 191W i5 11600K (MCE enabled) 599 4328 31.00fps 13.97fps 233W

Game benchmarks next and here we're reprising the titles from our RAM tests plus my favourite go-to CS:GO. With ABT enabled we see a seven per cent boost to performance and an eight per cent improvement to the worst one per cent frame-times. That's not bad for a simple BIOS switch. Especially if you're trying to keep your frame-rate in the sweet spot for G-Sync or FreeSync on your monitor but even if you just want minimal input lag at frame-rates much higher than your monitor's refresh rate an extra 20fps is always welcome.

CS:GO: DX9 Very High AF off

Next Ashes is entirely CPU-bound even at 4K and uses as many cores as it can so it's a natural candidate for ABT to make a noticeable difference. Indeed we do see a two per cent increase when the switch is flipped even though that's only good for an extra frame per second. For context though that's twice the increase that we saw when swapping from 3066MHz to 3600MHz RAM so we'll count that as a repeatably measurable difference.

Far Cry 5 is basically the opposite of Ashes heavily relying on one core so it's not surprising to see a far smaller impact here of only one per cent or about 3fps. Still we saw similar margins through repeated runs so it's more than run-to-run variance impacting our results here.

Far Cry 5: Ultra TAA

Crysis 3 is last. This game famously doesn't really care about memory speed and so it goes with Adaptive Boost too. The game is just fractionally faster with ABT engaged although the worst one per cent scores do rise by 2.5 per cent. Again not earth-shattering stuff but it is at least measurable - and perhaps this is something that can be optimised over time.

So there we have it - measurable performance uplifts but not particularly impactful ones. I'm curious to see if we've missed a trick here by testing with MCE enabled as perhaps we'd see a more noticeable performance increase when the processor is operating within its stock limits. There was also a BIOS update that hit after we completed our 11900K testing which uses the same microcode as 610 but may still alter how ABT operates. We'll no doubt come back to this feature in future if we do spot more potential for it as the thinking behind it does seem sound and we expected slightly better performance from enabling it.

One final note: given that the slide states that Adaptive Boost isn't considered overclocking this is a nice way to unlock a small amount of extra performance without falling foul of your warranty. Manual overclocking can be a bit nerve-wracking in the early going so a friendly-looking BIOS switch that says ""give me more performance"" is nice to have. It's also a necessary value-add for potential 11900K owners - who are otherwise facing a tough time justifying the Core i9 over a cheaper Core i7 that has the same core count and only slightly slower clock speeds. For their sake I hope other outlets - or future BIOS updates - show bigger improvements as right now I'd be leaning towards the Core i7 if I was shopping myself.

Regardless I hope we see Adaptive Boost available on the full lineup of Intel processors in future; more mainstream processors could certainly benefit from the extra performance.

In a recent study a team of researchers from Intel Labs describe a method for improving the realism of synthetic images and they take scenes from GTA V to get their point across.

The project titled ""Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement"" explains how the AI machine learning tool assists in making computer-generated images more realistic by examining the layers of the game animation and comparing them to actual urban street scenes.In an attempt to close the ""appearance gap"" between artificial and real images the approach they took was to enhance already rendered images. What they did was to extract intermediate rendering buffers called G-buffers produced by the game engine. These buffers provide information on the geometry distance to the camera materials and lighting in the scene.All their methods were applied on the Cityscapes dataset – a large diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities with scenes that look quite similar to those you can find on Google Maps Street View. The modifications tried to stay true to the original images.Their complex work is explained in more detail in a video released by Intel. The researchers do not just show photos to exemplify the difference between the approach they took and other enhancement techniques but also display a little bit of gameplay to help us better visualize the results.The AI machine added realistic details greening the parched grass and hills in GTA's California making it look more voluminous at the same time. Additionally it gave reflections to the building's windows increased the mirroring of the roof of the cars changed the color grading and it also removed distant haze and rebuilt the roads.Putting the pieces together resulted in an enhanced realism of the photos making some video sequences from the game look more like an interactive movie. Of course it doesn't replicate the real world 1:1 but they tried to get pretty close to it by using GTA V"

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.89 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.68 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry Chewy (CHWY) has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.

This online pet store is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of +5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Chewy's revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.

The endowment given by the Phillips family was created to recognize paper science and engineering students who show a strong interest in business and professional success. The recipients of this award are to demonstrate academic achievement strong leadership and service within their community. This leadership incentive allows for paper science and engineering students to pursue a business administration minor from the Poole College of Management at NC State.

Before coming to NC State Dr. Phillips retired as the Senior Vice President – Technology and Manufacturing from International Paper. Dr. Phillips is currently an Adjunct Professor and the Executive in Residence in the Department of Forest Biomaterials at NC State. He teaches and consults with our faculty staff and students to elevate the level of our courses and curricula research teaching and outreach. He is also an expert consultant in our industry.

Making Futures Brighter

Each spring rising juniors and seniors are given the opportunity to apply for this prestigious award. This year the Phillips Family Leadership Incentive was awarded to four outstanding students in the Paper Science and Engineering program. Congratulations to our 2021-2022 recipients Kyra Attridge Tressa Glackin Matthew Klassa & Natalie Laux.

Kyra Attridge

I first learned of the Phillips Family Leadership Incentive my junior year of high school when I toured my local paper mill and was introduced to the PSE program at NC State. Not only did I fall in love with the paper industry that day but I also learned the impact having a strong foundation in business can have on an engineer. In my 12 months of work experiences while what I have learned in my paper classes has made me a good intern my deeper understanding of the ins and outs of the industry from my business classes have made me a good engineer. I am immensely honored to be recognized as a leader in our program and to have received this award and am equally grateful to Dr. Phillips and his family.

As an out-of-state and first-generation college student this award is removing the financial burden of my senior year allowing me to focus on academics and embrace my final stretch of undergrad before emerging into the workforce. Thanks to the Phillips’ generosity I will now also have the economic freedom to further my business education and pursue an MBA later in my career. I am also looking forward to developing as a professional by working closely with Dr. Phillips on a business-related project. Between the skills I develop from the project the knowledge from my engineering and business classes and my work experience I will be able to quickly progress in my career into a managerial position. I could not be more thankful for receiving this scholarship and all the other help from our PSE program along the way and am eager to pay it forward.

Tressa Glackin

One important part of paper science is how well the program prepares its students to enter and excel in industry which includes moving up to management positions within mills. I knew even in my freshman year that my career goals included fulfilling those expectations and becoming a leader in a mill and in industry and that learning about business would help accomplish this. The service aspect of this award is also incredibly important to me because I know how prevalent teamwork is within the pulp and paper industry and I know that I could not have gotten where I am today without the help and support of all the people in my life. This award is an incredible opportunity to continue pursuing that knowledge and to become even more involved with the PSE program.

As an out of state student especially one with siblings that have also gone through college and even continued their education beyond undergrad I cannot even begin to explain how financially helpful this award is. I am so honored to be selected as a recipient and I look forward to continuing to learn more about leadership service and professional success.

Being selected as one of this year’s recipients is a significant honor for me. When I entered college I looked up to the student leaders in our program who received this award. I aspired to serve our campus community and give back to our program like they had done but I never fully believed that I was capable of serving and leading as much as they did. However to be selected as one of this year’s recipients gives me a fresh boost of confidence. It is incredibly gratifying to be recognized by my professors and fellow volunteers. Additionally it also reminds me of my obligation to continue serving and acting as a role model for incoming students. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and honor!

Furthermore one of my professional goals is to be a leader in our industry and this award will help me to achieve this. By enabling me to add a business minor to my dual degree this award gives me the opportunity to gain a basic understanding of the different aspects of businesses. This type of understanding will prove invaluable in earning the trust of my future peers and mentors. I can build on this foundation of trust to lead and serve in my future roles. While this award will significantly help me in the immediate future financially perhaps even more importantly it will set me up for success in reaching my long-term goals.

Coming up on my final year here at NC State I have taken some time to reflect on my journey here and those who have traveled it with me. With that comes the need to thank my family who has supported me in all my endeavors and the PSE program who has become my family and helped me to grow and learn in ways I never could have imagined.

Whenever I tell someone that I am majoring in Paper Science Engineering they generally ask what it is and how I found it. As far as the how part of that question goes well I did not find it but rather it found me. I did not know what I was going to do past the idea of being an engineer but once I was introduced to the world of paper I fell in love. In love with the chemistry the complicated manufacturing process the faculty and all the students that made NC State feel like home. Without PSE I do not know where I would be right now but I cannot imagine anything better than where I am.

The opportunity to apply for scholarships specific to my field has been an immense assistance to me personally. As someone paying for their own education a huge scholarship like this is simply unimaginable and a huge blessing. With the financial assistance of this scholarship I will be able to continue my involvement and leadership with TAPPI and my campus ministry while graduating debt-free. Thank you to everyone who makes this endowment possible. It means more than you can imagine.

A Sincere Thank you…

Our paper science and engineering program is truly made world class by the many individuals and companies who give of their time talents and treasures. A sincere thank you is in order for Dr. Phillips and his family for this generous and creative endowment. This scholarship has increased the awareness and need for engineers with business skills and significantly impacted the number of students pursing business minors and courses.

An analysis of the fossil fuel company’s documents also found it tried to downplay the dangers of climate change

Exxon Mobil Corp. has used language to systematically shift blame for climate change from fossil fuel companies onto consumers according to a new paper by Harvard University researchers.

The paper published yesterday in the journal One Earth could bolster efforts to hold the oil giant accountable in court for its alleged deception about global warming.

""This is the first computational assessment of how Exxon Mobil has used language in subtle yet systematic ways to shape the way the public talks about and thinks about climate change"" Geoffrey Supran a research fellow at Harvard and co-author of the paper said in an interview with E&E News.

""One of our overall findings is that Exxon Mobil has used rhetoric mimicking the tobacco industry to downplay the reality and seriousness of climate change and to shift responsibility for climate change away from itself and onto consumers"" he added.

A spokesperson for Exxon Mobil disputed the paper calling it part of a coordinated legal campaign against the company.

Supran and co-author Naomi Oreskes a professor of the history of science at Harvard (and Scientific American columnist) conducted a computational analysis of 180 Exxon Mobil documents from 1972 to 2019 including peer-reviewed publications advertorials in The New York Times and internal memos.

Using a series of algorithms the Harvard researchers found that Exxon Mobil had privately relied on some terms while publicly avoiding them altogether.

For example Exxon Mobil's internal documents frequently described climate change as a problem caused by ""fossil fuel combustion."" But in public-facing documents the company referred to global warming as a problem caused by the ""energy demand"" of ""consumers.""

The public communications sought to deflect responsibility for climate change away from the oil giant and onto individual consumers who heat their homes and fill their cars with gas the researchers wrote.

Following their merger in 1999 Exxon and Mobil also increasingly presented climate change as a ""risk"" rather than a reality the analysis found.

This language sought to minimize the dangers of global warming while not denying their existence outright the paper says.

Court battles

The researchers drew a direct comparison between Exxon Mobil and major tobacco companies which they said used similar tactics to shape public discourse about smoking cigarettes.

""These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations — which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms — and onto consumers"" they wrote.

In the 1990s attorneys general from all 50 states sued the largest U.S. tobacco companies over their alleged deception about the harmful health effects of smoking cigarettes and the addictive nature of nicotine. The suits culminated in a $206 billion master settlement agreement (Climatewire March 10).

Since 2017 five states and more than a dozen municipalities have filed similar suits alleging that the biggest U.S. oil and gas companies misled the public about the climate risks of burning fossil fuels. The complaints ask the oil industry to help cover the costs of addressing floods wildfires and other disasters fueled by rising global temperatures.

Supran said that although he didn't conduct the study with the climate liability litigation in mind the findings can nonetheless inform the legal fights.

""Obviously we did this completely independently. I've never spoken to any of the lawyers involved"" Supran said. ""But certainly with hindsight our insights may be relevant especially to these more nascent cases alleging deceptive marketing.""

Last month New York City filed a lawsuit asserting that Exxon Mobil BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC violated the city's consumer protection law by engaging in ""green washing"" or the practice of making their fossil fuel products seem more environmentally friendly than they really are.

Exxon pushback

Asked for comment on the paper Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said in an email to E&E News: ""This research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against Exxon Mobil and other energy companies.""

Norton noted that Oreskes is on retainer with Sher Edling LLP a San Francisco-based law firm that represents a slew of the challengers in the climate liability suits. ""Oreskes did not disclose this blatant conflict of interest"" he said.

Norton also pointed to the paper's partial funding from the Rockefeller family which Exxon has accused of supporting a climate conspiracy against the company (Climatewire May 4).

""The research was paid for by the Rockefeller Family Fund which is helping finance climate change litigation against energy companies"" he said. ""This follows a previous study attacking Exxon Mobil that used a similar discredited methodology.""

Norton was referring to a 2017 paper by Supran and Oreskes in the journal Environmental Research Letters that found Exxon's communications from 1977 to 2014 misled the public about climate science.

Vijay Swarup Exxon's vice president of research and development previously blasted the 2017 paper as ""fundamentally flawed"" in a comment in Environmental Research Letters last year.

Norton concluded by stressing that Exxon supports climate action noting that the oil giant recently proposed a massive carbon capture project in Houston (Energywire April 20).

""Exxon Mobil supports the Paris climate agreement and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies"" he said.

In a joint statement to E&E News Supran and Oreskes pushed back on Norton's allegations.

""Sher Edling played no role in the paper we published today nor in any other academic work we have done. They have not funded any of our studies; they have not reviewed our data or interpretations prior to its peer-reviewed publication; and we have never discussed any of our work concerning ExxonMobil with them. Therefore there is no conflict of interest and nothing to disclose"" the researchers said.

""For context we note that over the past four years ExxonMobil have attacked us and our work"" they added. ""It has become a familiar pattern. We publish science ExxonMobil offers spin and character assassination. ExxonMobil is now misleading the public about its history of misleading the public.""

(AFP Photo)

The South China Sea (SCS) dispute is one of the many inter-state issues that challenge the resolve of the Philippines’ foreign policy of upholding peaceful coexistence and mutual respect with other claimant-states especially China.

This is in line with a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the dispute based on the Philippines’ commitment to international law regional stability and peaceful co-existence with its neighbours without compromising the integrity of its national territory sovereignty national interests and security.

Such resolve was challenged during the Scarborough Standoff in 2012 under the watch of President Benigno Aquino’s administration.

The Scarborough Shoal Standoff in 2012 pertains to the tensions between China and the Philippines over the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Tensions began on 8 April 2012 after the attempted apprehension of eight Chinese fishing vessels near the shoal by the Philippine Navy.

The more than two months standoff at the shoal ended when the Philippines pulled out on 15 June 2012. The direct consequence of the standoff and subsequent pull-out of the Philippine Navy resulted in a shift in control of the shoal from the Philippines to China which has constantly maintained a coast guard presence at the shoal since 2012.

The Scarborough Shoal is a rock in the South China Sea approximately 120 nautical miles west of the Philippine island of Luzon which is claimed by the Philippines and China. There are no structures built on Scarborough Shoal thus far.

PCA Ruling

To save face because of the poor handling of the Scarborough Standoff the Aquino administration opted for a legal approach instead of conceding to the insistence of China to resolve the conflict of interest over the Scarborough Shoal through bilateral negotiations and dialogue without the involvement of the United States (US) or other powers not party to the dispute.

In 2013 the Aquino administration filed a case against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague Netherlands which resulted in a promising outcome in favour of the Philippines. However China made it clear from the very beginning that it would neither accept nor participate in the arbitral proceedings because as far as it was concerned the contentions presented by the Philippines were not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

China made a declaration on 25 August 2006 stating that it does not accept any of the procedures provided for in Section 2 of Part XV of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) concerning all the categories of disputes referred to in Paragraph1(a)-(c) of Article 298 of the Convention. The Philippines also submitted a similar “understanding”.

Elucidations

Nevertheless the tribunal award gave the Philippines a moral high ground and resulted in some kind of euphoria among Filipinos in general. Moreover as a proviso the PCA ruling did not denote the victory of sovereignty (ownership) over the territorial and maritime claims of the Philippines in the disputed waters of the SCS.

This means that the arbitral tribunal did not tackle matters related to territorial sovereignty over the disputed maritime features between the parties which further means that the tribunal did not decide who owned the maritime features located in the SCS such as the Spratly Islands that are claimed by China and the Philippines and even Vietnam and Malaysia as well.

Similarly the tribunal did not delimit (demarcate or set limits) of any maritime boundaries between the Philippines and China in the SCS.

The award simply clarified the maritime entitlements of the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) declared the nine-dash line of China as being without basis acknowledging the damage to the marine ecosystem and resources caused by reclamations in the SCS and even ruled that the surrounding waters of the Scarborough Shoal as a traditional fishing ground where Filipinos Chinese and even Vietnamese can fish. It also stated that the shoal is a rock that cannot generate an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) because it cannot sustain life.

Another factual inaccuracy that needs to be clarified for Filipinos to have a deeper understanding of the so-called arbitral ruling is the fact the award is not a PCA ruling. Although the PCA discharged and announced the ruling nonetheless the PCA only served as the registry (record office) or secretariat (a permanent administrative office that carries out substantive and administrative work) of the arbitral tribunal constituted under the UNCLOS.

Tetsuo Kotani in his article “The South China Sea Arbitration: No It’s Not a PCA Ruling” explained that the PCA is not a court in the general sense but an administrative body with the object of having permanent and readily available means for arbitration.

The PCA serves as the registry rather than a tribunal and facilitates arbitration and other dispute resolution proceedings among states intergovernmental organisations and private parties. Kotani also further clarified that unlike the International Criminal Court (ICJ) the PCA is not a UN organisation.

Realities

One of the many issues and dilemmas behind the PCA ruling is the issue of enforcement. In an anarchic international state system where the world lacks any supreme authority or sovereign meaning there is no world police force the PCA ruling can be likened to a paper tiger which appears to be powerful or threatening but is in fact ineffectual. Thus it is somehow challenging and difficult to enforce. This is the glaring reality.

Even if the PCA ruling had the backing of a UN General Assembly resolution it would never have the guarantee of enforcement through UN mechanisms. Consisting of 193 members where one country has one vote; apart from the approval of budgetary measures UN General Assembly (UNGA) decisions in the form of resolutions are at best a “recommendation”.

This means they have no binding power over member states. And in any case if the tribunal award is then brought to the UN Security Council (UNSC) on the pretext of “peace and security” it will also be shot down as China is a permanent member of the UNSC.

To note decision-making at the UNSC is by consensus and permanent members like China can veto any resolution that goes against its sovereign interests.

Take the case of Nicaragua vs. the US in 1986. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the US had violated international law by supporting the Contras in their rebellion against the Sandinistas and by mining Nicaragua’s harbours.

The case was decided in favour of Nicaragua and against the US with the awarding of reparations to Nicaragua.

However the US refused to participate in the proceedings arguing that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The US walked out of the Court after the jurisdictional decision was rendered but before the merits phase got underway. The US also blocked enforcement of the judgment through the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) by exercising its veto power and preventing Nicaragua from obtaining any compensation.

The UNGA adopted four resolutions calling for “full and immediate compliance with the judgment of the ICJ but the US however continued to claim that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction in the case and had exercised its veto in the UNSC. Hence Nicaragua did not succeed in securing full US compliance with the judgment.

The only way to enforce the PCA ruling without the concession of China if the Philippines insist is to go to war. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte begs the question at what cost and at whose expense and who would ultimately benefit from it?

For Duterte war is not an option in resolving its dispute and differences with China because no one would benefit from it. In a war everyone loses in some way or another. That’s a fact of life which has been witnessed throughout the history of the world.

Another reality that Filipinos must contend with is the uneven balance of power the blatant asymmetry of economic and military power between the Philippines and China soft power projections and the increasing influence of China on the international stage among countries.

One should take note that China’s soft power projections and influence in the world have gained so much traction especially in this time of the coronavirus pandemic. This is because China has been helping the developing world by supplying necessary vaccines and other forms of assistance in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Another factor is the launch and continuous traction achieved by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and now the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – a free trade agreement between the Asia-Pacific nations of Australia Brunei Cambodia China Indonesia Japan Lao Malaysia Myanmar New Zealand the Philippines Singapore South Korea Thailand and Vietnam.

Thus when it comes to persuasion and influence between the Philippines and China it is obvious that China will win to its side many developing world countries least developed countries and countries that are part of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) which is a large voting bloc as well in the UNGA.

Source: Various

This is precisely because these countries have economic and trade partnerships and development projects with China and won’t want to sacrifice or jeopardise them for the sake of the Philippines over the PCA ruling.

The rationale of any state is to always prioritise its interests over the interests of other states to survive in the anarchic world order. This is the hard reality that Filipinos must come to terms with because this is realpolitik in inter-state relations.

Hence the Philippines must navigate through these realities prudently and judiciously to protect itself and preserve its national interests and security. It is prudent and wise to choose the path of diplomacy rather than conflict when resolving the country’s differences with China via constructive bilateral relations coupled with multilateralism within the ambit of both international laws and ASEAN by pushing for the China-ASEAN Code of Conduct (COC) for the SCS.

Moving Forward

The Philippines and China are friendly neighbours and this will probably never change through time. And even among friends conflicts of interest and differences exist. But what matters is the maturity and constructive way of resolving these differences.

Thus rather than singling out demonising and ostracising China which may result in further escalation of conflict between the two countries the Philippines should rather prioritise pushing for the conclusion of the COC establish strategic partnership with China and collaborate on practical solutions to the SCS dispute which may include joint exploration and development of fishing oil and gas resources in the SCS coupled with continued shared infrastructure and coordinated investments.

This win-win strategy and solution are akin to turning a dilemma into an opportunity that engenders tangible benefits and fosters a better and progressive future for all Filipinos and Chinese rather than the “zero-sum game” of singling-out targeting and isolating China.

At the end of the day establishing amity and mutual understanding between the two countries is key to sound state-to-state relations.

The sounds of rattling metal and a hammer hitting nails echoed as we entered the congested Freedom Park informal settlement along the R553 Golden Highway south of Johannesburg. When City Press visited this week it had been another busy day for Freddy Mohale. He was erecting his second shack of the day for a client who had recently bought a small plot of land in the rocky area.





“I have been up since 6am busy trying to provide shelter for those in desperate need” said the 53-year-old who was sweating profusely. “I build these shacks it’s my work.”

In his work trousers and jacket topped with a black cap Mohale seemed undeterred.

In stark contrast to the corrugated iron shack he was building under construction a few metres away was a face-brick building that on completion would consist of one- and two-bedroom units.

A fence separates the two disparate construction sites.

Having moved to the area “about a month ago” Mohale who is a welder by trade said he had already been commissioned to build five more shacks when we met him.

“People are desperate for housing and they cannot afford rent because they are unemployed. Even this area is running out of space” he said. “The area is too congested now but what can we do as we need to survive?”

The demand was noticeable as the shiny homes stood shoulder to shoulder around him. A relative who has lived in Freedom Park for two years introduced Mohale to the area.

“It’s too full here. We are running out of space. People are suffering and struggling ... they need some form of shelter. And if there is land available we will use it. We can no longer afford to pay landlords in our townships. Renting has become tougher because of the Covid-19 pandemic” explained Mohale.

Having been a frequent visitor to Freedom Park Mohale knew the neighbourhood and its residents well. He built shacks in the area even before moving there.

“I have seen the number of shacks grow over the years” he said stopping to wipe sweat from his forehead. “I used to rent a back room in Soweto but over time I struggled to come up with the rent money. I finally decided to move here as a result.”

A despondent Mohale explained that he was retrenched last year and expressed his concern about “how those who can afford [homes] view us”.

“No one wakes up one day wishing to be jobless and without shelter. People might get angry that we have built these shacks here but it is not by choice. It’s a means to survive. We are trying as best as we can and building this shack right now is for the survival of both myself and the person who needs the shelter.

“Using the money I had saved up I bought a small plot of land here and built myself a shack.”

Looking over at the face-brick block of flats under construction he said: “These people actually don’t want us here. They want us gone but we have nowhere else to go.”

Meanwhile about 8km away at the Nana’s Farm informal settlement – between Eldorado Park and Lenasia along the N12 highway – Lerato Madiba and two men sat outside her one-room shack. They were discussing how many corrugated iron sheets she needed for her new toilet.

A few metres away a young man was hard at work. The sound of a pickaxe and spade filled the air as he dug a hole where the toilet would be built.

The 47-year-old told City Press she moved to the area last September but could not afford to build the toilet until now.

“I have been unemployed and the cost for digging alone is R350 excluding the R850 I have to pay someone to build the toilet” Madiba said.

Her family has been using the neighbour’s toilet.

In Mapetla in Soweto where she lived with her mother and six family members the conditions became unbearable because of the overcrowded four-bedroom home. Renting was not an option as she was unemployed.

“I heard about this place and I saw the number of shacks increase at an alarming rate every time I went past in a taxi. I then spoke to some community members and I got a stand and built my small shack.”

Madiba said she paid R1 500 for the plot “at the office up the road”. Attempts by City Press to track down the officials who received the payments were unsuccessful.

Last year the Johannesburg Metro Council brought an urgent court application to have more than 300 shacks at Nana’s Farm removed.

THE ENGINEER

The need to be closer to the economic hubs where job opportunities are has seen a large number of people move from various parts of the country in pursuit of a better life for their families

Vusi Baleni a civil engineer and project manager at the Bigen Group an infrastructure development company told City Press that according to available data informal settlements have grown exponentially – from 300 in 1994 to more than 2 750 in 2011.



“According to the Informal Settlement Atlas [2009/10] compiled by the national department of human settlements there were 625 informal settlements in Gauteng alone” Baleni said.





Asked why there was such a huge increase Baleni said this was mostly caused by urbanisation.

“The need to be closer to the economic hubs where job opportunities are has seen a large number of people move from various parts of the country in pursuit of a better life for their families” he said.

“They are then affected by the shortage of affordable housing which leads to people settling informally.”

But he cautioned that the country’s “ageing bulk infrastructure in particular water roads sanitation and electricity have been overburdened by these unplanned settlements making it difficult for municipalities to plan and maintain infrastructure”.

MOUNTAIN CITY

Community members of the Mountain City informal settlement located in Walkerville south of Johannesburg were gathered at one of the two water tanks in G Block when the City Press team arrived.

As residents took turns to fill their bucket Nomakhosi Radebe lamented: “The water situation in the area is dire.”

Radebe patiently waited her turn with her empty 10-litre and 20-litre buckets. She moved to the area from Thokoza a township in Ekurhuleni in December.

The 40-year-old told City Press: “We have not had water for two days and that is why it is busy here today.”

This was evident by the number of residents – some pushing wheelbarrows containing up to five buckets – slowly making their way to the crowded water tank.





Radebe said she was forced to move to the area after both she and her husband lost their jobs and could no longer afford to pay their landlord rent of R500 a month.

“We bought a one-room shack here that had already been erected for R2 700. It is better because we do not have to worry about paying rent every month” she said.

“While people might say we are not meant to be living on this land and therefore cannot be complaining about a lack of water provision at the end of it we are human beings trying to survive. Water is a basic need. And we need it.”

With only two water tanks for her block Radebe said: “Government needs to provide us with our most basic needs water being one of them. It hurts that we are being treated this way yet we are expected to vote when elections come around.”

Development here is not what we hoped it would be by now. The area is obviously occupied by unemployed and disadvantaged people and that makes things worse

Jeffrey Maluleka the chairperson of the G Block development team at the Mountain City informal settlement explained that the settlement was divided into seven blocks – A to G.



Speaking to City Press at his tuck shop Maluleka said: “Our mandate as the development team is to ensure that services such as water and proper sanitation are available in the area. We are responsible for the development of the area and also ensuring that it is kept clean.”

Maluleka moved to the area in October 2019.

“Development here is not what we hoped it would be by now. The area is obviously occupied by unemployed and disadvantaged people and that makes things worse” the 44-year-old admitted.

According to Maluleka his block currently has more than 2 000 shacks. He vowed that they would not leave the area despite attempts by the city to remove them.

WHAT THE DEPARTMENT SAYS

Castro Ngobese Gauteng department of human settlements spokesperson confirmed that there was a “growing culture of land grabs on vacant state and privately owned land”.

“The prevalence of the illegal occupation of land and erection of structures has emerged predominantly in the economic centres of the province including the cities of Johannesburg Tshwane and Ekurhuleni.”

According to Ngobese there was a substantial backlog in housing – estimated to be between 2.3 million and 3.7 million units.

He urged those seeking housing to approach the department or their local municipality to register so they could receive housing support.

“The illegal occupation of public and privately owned land is a criminal act. Where illegal structures are erected the matter shall be referred to the police” he said.

Ngobese added that the housing backlog had worsened since 1994 because of “unscrupulous people who are illegally selling parcels of land and political influence”.

Positive Points

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY Financial) reported a strong quarter with a 6% increase in total revenue and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

The company experienced robust growth in its core business segment with revenue up 7% for the quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) achieved significant sales success including 11 competitive core takeaways and strong interest in new solutions like the Financial Crimes Defender.

The company's Banno Digital banking platform continues to grow now serving over 11.6 million users with approximately 200000 new users added per month.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) maintains a strong sales pipeline keeping it near an all-time high which supports ongoing optimism for future performance.

Negative Points

Despite strong sales the actual revenue recognition from these sales is expected in future years indicating a lag between sales success and financial impact.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) faces increasing competition in the financial technology space with new entrants continuously emerging.

The company noted a decrease in deconversion revenue by approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation among clients.

Increased regulatory scrutiny and changes in the banking sector could pose challenges to client operations and affect their technology spending.

Operational costs have risen including higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees which could impact profit margins if not managed effectively.

Q: Dave could you provide your perspective on the sales pipeline and the lower end of the non-GAAP revenue guidance for fiscal '24?

A: David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO: We had our best third quarter sales ever and replenished our sales pipeline to near record levels. I'm optimistic about future sales opportunities. Mimi can provide more details on the financial guidance.

Q: Greg is there an opportunity for Jack Henry to use AI internally to lower costs?

Q: Mimi can you discuss the factors contributing to the margin performance this year and the outlook for future margin progression?

A: Mimi L. Carsley - Jack Henry & Associates Inc. - CFO & Treasurer: This year's margin performance was driven by strong execution operational focus and product mix.

Q: Greg can you provide an update on the implementation queues and how they are managed in relation to margin expansion?

Major Facilities and Artistic and Community Programs Are Named for Ernest and Evelyn Rady Joan and Irwin Jacobs The Conrad Prebys Foundation and Una Davis

Public Phase Begins Inviting the Community to Join in Securing the Future

THE RADY SHELL AT JACOBS PARK™

The San Diego Symphony Orchestra Association announced that “The Future Is Hear” its $125 million comprehensive campaign has now surpassed the 75 percent milestone having raised $98.7 million to date.

“The Future Is Hear” was developed to support the organization’s wide-ranging artistic and community programs including construction of an extraordinary state-of-the art year-round outdoor waterfront venue and public park along the Embarcadero. The campaign also encompasses improvement of the infrastructure of Copley Symphony Hall at the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Music Center engagement of all of San Diego’s diverse communities with transformative musical experiences and ensuring the future of the Symphony. Thanks to the pillars of San Diego’s philanthropic and cultural community and impressive additional patron support fulfillment of the campaign is now in sight.

Acknowledging its consortium of lead donors for their extraordinary investments the San Diego Symphony has named its permanent new outdoor venue The Rady Shell in honor of Ernest and Evelyn Rady. The venue’s bayside surroundings have been named Jacobs Park in honor of Joan and Irwin Jacobs. The central gathering space for al fresco dining and socializing has been named Prebys Plaza in honor of Conrad Prebys and The Conrad Prebys Foundation. The performance area has been named the Una Davis Family Stage in honor of Una Davis.

Ernest and Evelyn Rady have contributed the lead gift of $15 million to support the construction of the venue. Joan and Irwin Jacobs have given $11 million in support of the outdoor venue in addition to other significant leadership gifts to support various aspects of the comprehensive campaign. The Conrad Prebys Foundation has made a $15 million contribution with $12.5 million in support of the outdoor venue. A $10 million gift made possible by Una Davis ensured the project’s success in the early stages of the campaign.

“When I first stood on the stage early in the construction of what would become The Rady Shell I was surprised at how much I was moved” said Ernest Rady. “Its potential and power are beyond what I could have imagined. We are supporting this project because of the impact we believe it will have on our city and our region – welcoming both our residents and our visitors. This is a venue that will not only feature our amazing orchestra and preeminent artists but also be a public park with programming for families school children and individuals on the beautiful landscape surrounded by San Diego Bay with our city’s skyline in full view. We cannot wait to be a part of the first performances and see the joy it will bring to so many.”

“It was more than 18 years ago that we first thought that the San Diego Symphony should have a permanent outdoor home” said Irwin Jacobs. “The summer season has long been a memorable tradition to so many San Diegans. From Inspiration Point Mission Bay and Navy Pier we were an orchestra looking for the perfect location. Finally with the move to the Embarcadero Marina Park South we found our place. It took many more years to make it our home but with The Shell’s opening that is exactly what it will become. The realization of The Rady Shell at Jacobs Park has exceeded our wildest imagination. Its beauty and proximity to the Bay and the City are unique. What we are truly excited about is the acoustic magnificence of the venue showcasing our marvelous orchestra and its guests with truly excellent sound.” Joan Jacobs added “We are thrilled to support the park that is The Rady Shell’s home which will be open for everyone to enjoy both during concerts and in the time in between.”

Una Davis said of The Rady Shell at Jacobs Park ”I am delighted to see this venue come to life. From the stage where the music is made to the lawn where people will enjoy their family picnics and games to the magnificent views of our bay and our city I know it will be a tremendous asset to our downtown. I am so proud to be part of making this dream possible.”

The Conrad Prebys Foundation previously announced its generous support of The Rady Shell at Jacobs Park and its vision. “The Rady Shell at Jacobs Park is a venue that Conrad would have been very proud to support not only because of his love of music but because of all that it symbolizes as a public space. It will be used for many purposes and will bring our entire community together” said Tony Cortes Board Chair of The Conrad Prebys Foundation. “The Foundation is honored to steward Conrad’s legacy with support for this momentous project.”

Pacific Daily News

Guam High senior Travon Jacobs made up for the lack of a football season his senior year by breaking the high school record for the javelin throw.

Jacobs is best known as the Panthers quarterback. He has a good arm and had two above-average football seasons under his belt before the pandemic took football away.

Jacobs reunited with his former all-island receivers A.J. Johnson and Jalen Thach for the school's track and field team currently favored to win several individual and team events in the Guam Department of Education's Interscholastic Sports Association track and field season.

Johnson is faster than anyone in high school but Jacobs now has a number for the books: 47.11 meters.

Jacobs broke Michael Deleon's record throw of 45.94 meters set in 2017.

Jacobs said that he has been coached to throw the spear at a 45-degree angle but because of the constant headwind and occasional gusts that easily reach 15-20 mph he had to lower his trajectory to about 30 degrees.

And how far would that throw have been if it were a football in his hand?

""Oh a football? Hmm ... prolly 50 60 yards"" said Jacobs. ""And Thach would have caught it too. Thach will catch anything.""

Her eyes are closed and yet everything in that moment is understandable. It is a translation of sensation into emotion. Its grace is in its simplicity but also in its meaning being impossible to fully convey in words. The woman is Irène Jacob and she is performing in Krzysztof Kieślowski’s The Double Life of Véronique.

At this point in the film she is Weronika rather than Véronique a paired performance with subtle bridges and differences that explores the inexpressible communication surrounding us on a daily basis. Highly awarded at the time Jacob’s pair of musical characters is one of the great feats of European screen performance a tactile and dreamy rendition of a fantastical double haunting.

Kieślowski’s ambiguous film opens in Kraków where we see the early career of a classical singer called Weronika (Jacob). She is joyful and boisterous earning her place in an orchestra after a chance audition. She confides in her aunt (Halina Gryglaszewska) about her love life and how she believes she is not alone in the world confirmed when she witnesses herself on a coach of tourists visiting from France. Weronika dies on stage while performing the grief felt across Europe in Paris by her seeming double Véronique (Jacob).

Véronique is also musical but her life has gone down a different path. A teacher in a school she falls in love with a man (Philippe Volter) who performs a marionette show for the children. A game of clues is played across the city between the two until they eventually meet properly. Yet Véronique cannot shake the grief which follows her from the death of another self somewhere afar.

Jacob’s performance varies beautifully between these doppelgängers marionettes of the director that take on a life all of their own. Weronika’s grin feels expressive of a possession smiling with her teeth but not quite with her eyes. The proximity of her death feels strangely foretold and captured quietly in moments when alone. The worlds of the two characters are connected by music belying the transcendent qualities of the emotions on display. Jacob expertly expresses these wordless feelings and moments often through movement and small gestures. It gives the film and its central double performance the quality of a dream.

“Both variations of Véronique engage the world through touch to the point where it is not inconceivable that the characters only fully understand things when engaging them physically.”

Véronique in particular wanders as if in a state of sleep stumbling and running between the shadows of Parisian streets. Mystery surrounds her as the unnameable grief seeps through the cracks of Jacob’s performance gradually becoming torrential as the emotions of the character’s life reach various climaxes. The longing expressed in Jacob’s eyes still weighs on my mind allowing for similarly meandering daydreams about all of our half-forgotten moments of déjà vu; those little glimpses of lives before and after us echoing through the minutes and days.

Jacob’s performance is also a tactile one. Both variations of Véronique engage the world through touch to the point where it is not inconceivable that the characters only fully understand things when engaging them physically whether they are places or people. The way her hands move over objects feels strangely ritualistic. When she wanders the streets I follow the curiosity of her eyes matching it even as the performance pulls the viewer into considerations of everything from burned wrecks of cars to empty cafes in Saint-Lazare station.

An academic could label such an approach to performance as phenomenological but it would undermine the warmth and emotional affect that it results in. Kieślowski’s films are incredibly open to such cold intellectualisation but ultimately the performances and emotional qualities he uniquely draws from his actors are beyond textbook interpretation. “I always sense what I have to do” suggests Véronique. Jacob realises this with a truly wondrous gift.

Kieślowski gave Jacob space to develop each character insisting on her creating a set of gestures and traits for each woman. “I found it a bit strange making a list of gestures” she said “but it made me think a lot and found a concrete understanding about each of these characters.” These were from general aspects of personality to whole movements and quirks rendering each moment on screen unique and utterly of itself.

The Double Life of Véronique is Jacob’s strongest work because of such detail. Her pain and pleasure is believable as the instant of its arrival is so precisely on camera rather than just arising as a considered facsimile. Sensations possess everything of a life for a time. “Daily life is just full of intuition and premonition” Jacob said when discussing her inspiration for the characters “and solitude can sometimes bring intense moments of fullness.”

The film is filled with her grace in such moments as if we share for a time in the presence of something holy; the transcendent of the everyday world that we all understand but which is beyond the naive hope of our language to convey.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

J.B. Pritzker and state lawmakers on Wednesday to make his pitch for more state funding for critical city operations such as the public schools and to discuss the Chicago Bears’ $3.2 billion domed stadium proposal.

Johnson is backing the Bears’ proposal while Pritzker has labeled it a “nonstarter” in large part because of its large public funding component. Meeting with reporters late Wednesday afternoon Johnson said conversations are ongoing but stressed the need to replace Soldier Field.

“You have a 100-year-old building that is millions of dollars in debt. And so you have this asset that is not getting the full benefit for the people of the state of Illinois” he said. “And as the Bears continue to have these conversations with leadership as well as the rank-and-file members that’s the case that they will have to make but understanding that we have a structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.”

Johnson’s budget requests at the Illinois State Capitol came on the same day a state Senate committee approved legislation opposed by the mayor’s key ally the Chicago Teachers Union that would extend a school closure moratorium for all of the city’s public schools by two years. The CTU has labeled the measure initially drawn up to protect selective-enrollment schools as “racist” as the union presses to invest more money in neighborhood schools.

“We want an equitable school district that speaks to the needs of the people of the city of Chicago” Johnson said when asked about the bill. “And as these amendments continue to be assessed we’re going to create more space for these conversations so that we ultimately get to the goal that we want which is an equitable school district.”

Johnson previously has said his Springfield wish list includes $1 billion in state funding that’s “owed” to the “families of Chicago.” That money would include greater state aid under the evidence-based funding formula and additional teacher pension funds.

“We have to continue to make sure that the state of Illinois is doing right by the economic engine of the state of Illinois which is the city of Chicago” Johnson told reporters. “But it’s also to continue to build relationships of the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity and justice.”

Johnson’s request for additional funding for Chicago Public Schools could be a tall order as Pritzker has over the last few years increased state funding for elementary and high schools only by minimum target of $350 million annually set in a 2017 education funding compromise under his predecessor Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.

Advocates have warned that those increases are not enough to meet the state’s goals of adequately funding public schools in Chicago and other parts of the state.

Pritzker also has indicated that belt-tightening is needed to secure his $52.7 billion budget proposal which is now negotiated by state lawmakers ahead of a scheduled May 24 adjournment.

There was no full accounting of specifics disclosed by city or state officials on what the progressive mayor discussed at Wednesday’s meetings. But a meeting with progressive Democratic lawmakers involved some “less high-profile budget needs” such as lead service pipe replacement according to state Rep. Kelly Cassidy a Chicago Democrat.

She said school funding and the Bears’ stadium plan came up. But the meeting was brief and specifics were few Cassidy said.

Johnson arrived at the Capitol early Wednesday afternoon. He met separately with Pritzker the two top leaders of the Democrats’ legislative supermajority House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch of Hillside and Senate President Don Harmon of Oat Park and various lawmakers. At one point a reporter asked Johnson how the sessions were going.

“Well you know it’s Springfield” he said before walking up to the third floor of the Capitol.

Funding for Chicago’s public transportation apparatus could also be on Johnson’s Springfield agenda. Lawmakers are weighing a sweeping set of recommendations about what Chicago-area transit could look like in the future including whether the CTA should be consolidated with Metra and Pace into one agency and how to address a transit fiscal cliff expected when federal pandemic aid runs out.

But Pritzker and Johnson differ on who should be leading the charge. The governor has indicated in recent weeks that the CTA is due for an “evolution of the leadership” comments that were directed toward CTA President Dorval Carter who has come under fire by critics for the transit agency’s shortcomings. Johnson has not said whether Carter should be removed from his post.

Separately Wednesday members of the Chicago City Council’s aldermanic Black Caucus were in Springfield on Wednesday to talk to Welch about ward-level priorities including education and neighborhood improvement issues.

Ald. Jeanette Taylor of the South Side’s 20th Ward said she supports extending the moratorium on school closings and that there is a need to “invest in alternative schools.”

But she also cited the need for nuts and bolts infrastructure improvements.

“I could never in my tenure get all of my streets and sidewalks done and so I need to be able to ask those state (elected officials) senators and my Cook County commissioners because that’s the next stop. … ‘Hey how are we working together to make sure that every community looks good?'” Taylor said.

A story told by basketball author Ben Kaplan this week as the future of the show is up in the air speaks to the impact Johnson has made when the cameras aren’t rolling.

Kaplan took to X and detailed the story of Johnson doing two good deeds that were full-circle between Kaplan’s bar mitzvah and the death of his father.

When Kaplan was turning 13 years old his father surprised him with a video featuring Johnson Kenny Smith and former co-hosts Peter Vecsey and George Karl.

And here’s the second half. I still to this day have no idea how @PeterVecsey1 did this with a straight face. He knows he’s talking about a 13-yr-old on the biggest day of that kid’s life with friends and family watching! Incredible incredible performance. (7/X) pic.twitter.com/OduQqlz5gw — Ben Kaplan (@bkaplan4) May 7 2024

Kaplan’s father was able to get the segment for Kaplan by calling TNT and got a call back from Johnson as the TNT crew produced the segment during the 2000 NBA Playoffs.

Ben Kaplan and Johnson reconnected in 2022 when Kaplan’s father was battling cancer. Ben got in touch via email and Johnson sent his father a personalized video for his 72nd birthday. Johnson shared his number with Kaplan’s father and they kept in touch during his cancer treatments.

A few months later Kaplan and Johnson appeared on Meredith Shiner’s podcast to discuss the story.

So Meredith ended up having Ernie and I both on her pod to discuss the full circle moment together. We talked about faith and fathers and sports how those three things weaved together in our lives. It turned out wonderfully. Here’s the link:https://t.co/MHq2jvY3TF — Ben Kaplan (@bkaplan4) May 7 2024

Shortly after the episode’s release Kaplan’s father passed away.

Kaplan dedicated his upcoming book ‘Pipeline to the Pros: How D3 Small-College Nobodies Rose to Rule the NBA’ to his father and thanks Johnson for the gift.

I think about my dad a lot especially when I’m with my own boys and ESPECIALLY especially when we’re watching hoops. Every time I see Ernie on that TNT desk I think of his generosity about how he allowed me to repay the best gift I ever received. (18/x) — Ben Kaplan (@bkaplan4) May 7 2024

Johnson responded on X to Kaplan’s story thanking Kaplan for sharing it and sending well wishes to him and his family.

Ben my friend. You think you do but you have no idea what this series of events meant to me. My only explanation for the opportunity and the timing is as @petermayermusic writes in his song “Loose in the World” is that this was all “the hand of the Divine.” Blessings on you… https://t.co/kyoUxM6S7T — Ernie Johnson (@TurnerSportsEJ) May 8 2024"

Maybe Entrepreneurs Can.,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Warren Buffett recently described the American healthcare system as a ""tapeworm in the American economy."" Berkshire Hathaway JPMorgan Chase and Amazon formed Haven to disrupt the healthcare industry — which is 17 percent of GDP — and as Buffett put it ""the tapeworm won.""

One might assume that since three of the largest and most successful companies in the country couldn't create a more efficient healthcare system it can't be done. The truth is that Haven made some key missteps which now highlight the path for entrepreneurs who want to create a more affordable and accessible healthcare system.

Staffing snafu

Haven hired a CEO who was a brilliant physician and academic but who had limited experience in how healthcare administration works. It built a team around him of 57 academics clinicians and insurance veterans. It needed streetfighters.

At first things looked good. There was a public fight over a noncompete with UnitedHealthcare. That gave the healthcare market hope that maybe if one of the industry giants was so concerned about its trade secrets Haven would use the knowledge of how the system works to change it. That did not happen.

Partnership problems

Amazon which seemingly dominates any industry it wants was unable to break into the pharmacy business on its own terms because it could not get referrals or data from the major health plans all of which own pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). So Amazon agreed to a relationship that was patently undisruptive: a partnership with a PBM to create a mail-order pharmacy.

Amazon built its new pharmacy business on one of the most broken aspects of the healthcare industry which was guaranteed to undermine Haven. This is only the most overt example of the Haven companies relying on the industry they hoped to change.

Tapeworm tangle

The healthcare industry is so big that all of the Fortune 50 have a stake in the current healthcare system beyond their employee benefits. JPMorgan Chase and other large banks sell profitable growing healthcare companies that are benefiting from the broken system. Berkshire Hathaway has a longstanding reinsurance business that benefits from the prepayment of premiums to leverage its investment strategies.

What would Warren Buffett do?

Look no further than Warren Buffett's own investment strategy for a roadmap to fixing the healthcare system. Buffett has never been the moonshot guy. He's methodical. Loudly creating a venture to disrupt an entire industry isn't really his style. Incremental improvement is.

The changes needed in healthcare are small and many. And like Buffett's fortune their cumulative effect can be massive. A much-needed update to the formulary and rebate system can lower drug costs. Technology can ensure that patients pay the lowest possible price at the pharmacy. Not just auditing for billing errors but preventing them could save billions of dollars.

Dozens of changes like these can return money to employers and individuals without changing the quality of care or health outcomes in any way. Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway did find inefficiencies and lowered its own healthcare costs some. Good for him — he was on the right track but didn't have the proper team or structure to keep going.

Haven certainly had the potential to upend the systems that prevent competition in the current environment but it seems it simply wasn't channeled properly. The giants had their chance. Now it's up to startups and entrepreneurs to not waste this opportunity.

The head of the Wall Street major Jamie Dimon had on April 30 had committed an upfront $2 million financial aid along with an appeal to its over 2.5 lakh employees globally to chip in which would be matched by an equal amount by the company.

In an internal communication on Thursday which PTI has seen Filippo Gori the chief executive of JP Morgan Asia Pacific said the bank has set aside $3.8 million for the care of its over 35000 India employees and an additional $10 million is being earmarked in phases to support the needy in their pandemic recovery phase.

We've committed an additional $3.8 million to support our colleagues in India in their fight against the virus in 2021. This money will be used for medical insurance 24x7 ambulance service partnerships with our clinical service providers and hospitals for hotel and in-home quarantine doctor-on-call service; and vaccination reimbursement support Gori said in the mail.

The bank is also working towards increasing access to vaccines subject to availability and government regulations he added.

This is excluding the already-committed $2 million in immediate India-wide coronavirus relief efforts such as providing support to the public health system to improve the capacity of small hospitals enabling them to provide treatment for greater numbers of affected patients and also providing food and essential items to low-income communities.

Besides this the bank has also committed an additional $10 million to help the larger already-disadvantaged communities tide over the long-term consequences of the pandemic often those. This is part of JP Morgan's annual $32 million philanthropic commitment to building economic resiliencies for these communities Gori said.

This community support and outreach will include support to microbusinesses particularly those owned by women; helping youth pursue promising careers; and help support inclusive fintech solutions for the post-crisis environment ensuring access to financial tools that will help them weather any future crisis he said.

JP Morgan is also a member of the recently-announced global taskforce on the pandemic response a public-private partnership providing 1000 ventilators and a further 25000 oxygen concentrators to India. Gori said so far their employees have contributed $1.5 lakh towards India aid and the company will equally match that number.

In an email to all the employees on April 30 Dimon committed $2 million to Indian non-profits which are in the forefront of the pandemic fight along with an appeal to its employees to donate with an additional commitment to match their contributions with an equal amount by the company.

The total aid including medical supplies and medical equipments from the US is reportedly nearing $500 million.

This is to counter the issue of more subscribers on the telco’s broadband network.









With the arrival of the second round of lockdowns around the country the need for fibre broadband internet has shot up yet again. Because of that BSNL Bharat Fibre the FTTH arm of the state-run telco has been adding plenty of subscribers at a very fast rate. Another reason for the fast addition of broadband users is the quality and competitive plans that BSNL provides to its users.

The telco has upgraded its broadband networks from IPv4 to IPv6 for ensuring that a smooth internet experience can be provided to the users.

IPv4 Addresses Might Have Exhausted

Since BSNL has been adding a ton of new subscribers the telco might have exhausted the IPv4 addresses soon. To ensure that it doesn’t hinder the broadband internet experience of the users the telco has upgraded its networks to IPv6 for the FTTH users who are parented towards BSNL's Juniper BNGs(Broadband Network Gateway).

One thing that’s bound to happen when you configure IPv6 on your FTTH ONT (optical network terminal) is a better browsing experience. Since multiple websites today are compatible with IPv6 configuring the ONT to IPv6 will allow you to get a faster internet experience.

You can change the WAN settings on your ONU/ONT device of the connection. Presently the IP protocol on your ONU device would be configured as IPv4. But you need to change that to IPv4/IPv6.

BSNL Bharat Fibre Plans

BSNL Bharat Fibre offers a total of 6 plans for Rs 449 Rs 599 Rs 799 Rs 999 Rs 1277 and Rs 1499. The base plan of Rs 449 offers users 30 Mbps speed Rs 599 plan offers 60 Mbps speed Rs 799 plan offers 100 Mbps speed Rs 999 and Rs 1277 plan offers 200 Mbps speed and the Rs 1499 plan offers 300 Mbps speed.

All of the plans come with 3.3TB FUP data and none of the prices mentioned above is inclusive of GST. Users can also purchase some of these plans with long-term validities as well. BSNL offers the above plans in select circles of the country.",,,,,,,,,

But the side effects of the problems are lingering in The Lowcountry.

But fuel in The Lowcountry is supplied through another source besides the Colonial pipeline.

The mad dash for gas is what’s slowing the process not the supply of the fuel.

“Well that’s something that really concerns me. I’m an interpreter and I go all over the state of South Carolina and even out of state” said Miriam Berrouet a Lowcountry resident.

Some people are worried about a gas shortage.

“My barometer to decide what’s going on in our country right now is the gas prices. Think about what it was at the end of last year versus what’s happening now. As gas goes so does our country go” said Cheryl Taylor a Lowcountry resident.

Drivers aren’t the only ones dealing with lines. The same goes for gas station owners.

A man who owns nearly two dozen Lowcountry stations spoke with us.

He says two companies Kinder Morgan and Buckeye have fuel terminals in North Charleston.

Their product is brought in by barge on the Cooper River.

That gas is then supplied to the Lowcountry gas stations.

But the problem was when Colonial Pipeline shut down trucks from all over South Carolina and into North Carolina came to The Lowcountry for gas leading to a backup of trucks at the two terminals. He’s hearing drivers are waiting 4 hours to get gassed up.

“It has grown into a larger disruption because of the panic buying behavior and fear of running out of gas has taken control” said Hee Yoon Kwon an assistant professor of supply chain management at The Citadel.

The way to help ease the pain at the pump is to only get gas when you need it panic buying is causing stations to run dry.

“If no one ran to the gas station to top off their gas tanks to hoard gas in a panic buying behavior then we wouldn’t have any problems whatsoever” said Hee Yoon Kwon.

One of the reasons why gas is more expensive in The Lowcountry is because it’s more expensive to bring fuel in by the barge while in the upstate they rely more directly on the pipeline and terminals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvMjAyMS8wNS8xNi90ZXhhcy1tdXN0LWZpeC10aGUtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtcG93ZXItZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1zdXBwbHktbG9vcC10by1wcmV2ZW50LWFub3RoZXItYmxhY2tvdXQv0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29tbWVudGFyeS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L3RleGFzLW11c3QtZml4LXRoZS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1wb3dlci1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXN1cHBseS1sb29wLXRvLXByZXZlbnQtYW5vdGhlci1ibGFja291dC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas must fix the natural-gas-power-generation supply loop to prevent another blackout,"This op-ed is part of a series published by The Dallas Morning News Opinion section to explore ideas and policies for strengthening electric reliability. Find the full series here: Keeping the Lights On.

As Texans move past the damages of February’s winter storm we must not move on without making meaningful changes that guarantee increased reliability. No Texan should have to endure deadly conditions again because the electricity supply chain failed to sufficiently reform.

The immediate action that would ensure natural gas facilities can operate during emergencies is to map the supply chain to determine which natural gas production distribution and storage facilities feed into the natural gas electricity generation and local distribution companies. Then facilities can be designated as critical load. Maintaining power to the most critical assets will help keep the system operating.

In Texas 80% of the natural gas produced daily is not used for the production of electricity so it is imperative we focus on the most directly impacted assets to ensure those products and services are accessible and available to generators.

We also agree that proper weatherization of both power-generation and natural gas facilities directly connected to power generation are key elements of reform. Proper steps must be taken to ensure compliance. We also support tools to ensure generators have access and availability to the fuel they need in extreme emergency conditions.

Some have suggested that all natural gas infrastructure – including 86000 natural gas wells and another 164000 oil wells that produce associated natural gas – should weatherize. In fact many operators already weatherize at various levels. Yet without power no amount of weatherization matters. To truly increase reliability the research all points to focusing on the necessary infrastructure contracts weatherization and storage that will help ensure power generation continues through the next storm.

To fix any problem a proper evaluation of the cause must first be undertaken. The oil and natural gas industry called for a forensic analysis from the beginning and made a commitment to do its part in reform. Fact-finding is fundamental to focus on solutions that work.

A preliminary report from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas confirmed that power-generation units from just about all sources faced outages and the report named weather-related issues as the primary cause. Fuel limitation caused only 17% of the challenges. An independent analysis commissioned by the Texas Oil and Gas Association through the research firm Enverus makes clear that the issues with natural gas production and transportation began with outages originating at power-generation units.

Once power outages began natural gas production was impacted because facilities and infrastructure rely on electricity. The outages in turn impaired the ability to deliver natural gas supplies to power generators.

Even with these challenges Texas natural gas production exceeded the state’s demand during the storm yet matching supply with demand proved challenging.

Advertisement

Texas has almost 550 billion cubic feet of working natural gas storage capacity – more than 40 times the state’s typical total daily usage. Beyond storage capacity Texas produces more than twice the amount the state needs for daily natural gas usage of all types and five times the amount needed for natural gas-powered electric generation. Texas is awash in natural gas.

Not all natural gas facilities provide natural gas for electricity generation because natural gas is also used for direct home heating LNG exports and raw materials in manufacturing.

Improved communications supply chain mapping designation of critical load storage and weatherization of power generation and those natural gas facilities directly connected to generation are all keys to ensuring natural gas does its part to keep Texans warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It is imperative that lawmakers focus on reforms that will actually improve the reliability of our power grid.

The oil and natural gas industry remains committed to working with legislators to pass these dependable solutions. With an issue of this magnitude Texans deserve a serious evaluation of what really went wrong and reforms that will increase reliability in future emergency situations.

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1500-2000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals BoA reported.

The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus the impact of the ongoing chip shortage is not limited to semiconductor stocks since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle BoA noted.

Similar to industrial stocks semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus in 5G broadband and domestic chip manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist in semiconductor stocks they are offset by “solid visibility” that is driven by non-cancellable orders product customization and broad-based demand BoA concluded.

Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in gross margins signaling that semiconductor companies are “very effective” in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a positive driver for the sector BoA noted. As a result the SOX index has benefitted from rising rates historically.

“Over the past five years chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X” said Hilary Kramer who hosts the nationally aired “Millionaire Maker” radio program and heads the GameChangers and Value Authority advisory services.

Value investments had been trouncing growth stocks heading into trading on May 11 with the Russell 3000 Value Index up 19.1% in 2021 compared to a gain of 4.3% for the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested “a rest” would be overdue and healthy for the market.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates suggesting the market growth will last beyond 2022 Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage semiconductor stocks have not performed well since early April.

Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is “not great” but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

The top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) a Santa Clara California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA’s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS) above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers.

Potential catalysts for AMAT’s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity upgrades market share loss in key segments merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds BoA noted.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Include U.S.-based KLA Corp.

KLA Corp. gained a $400 price objective from BoA based on 22x 2022E P/E within KLAC’s historical range of 10x-26x. The investment firm envisions KLAC as a key enabler of semiconductor manufacturing technology offering a less cyclical topline industry leading profit margins and best-in-class shareholder returns.

Risks to BoA’s price objective for KLAC are the cyclical nature of semiconductor capital spending and its impact on earnings as well as competitive price and market share issues particularly against Applied Materials. Another vulnerability would occur if trouble arose in bringing new products and technologies to market BoA cautioned.

Nova Measuring Instruments Gets Berth as One of Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI) a Rehovot Israel-based provider of metrology devices for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing received a $108 price objective from BoA based on 34x a 2022 estimated non-GAAP EPS that includes stock compensation and adjustments for net cash. The valuation is within its peer range of 20x-40x and is justified BoA noted due to Nova’s superior gross margin profile and its potential to outgrow the market in the next three years.

Downside risks for the stock could include an inability to earn share in new X-Ray metrology market stiff competition from large rivals such as KLA Corp. and historically cyclical semiconductor capital spending. Nonetheless BoA lists NVMI among the six best semiconductor stocks.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Feature Teradyne

Another of the six best semiconductor stocks to buy now is Teradyne Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) a North Reading Massachusetts-based maker of automatic test equipment. BoA’s $155 price objective on TER is based on 25x P/E applied to a fiscal year 2022 estimated Non-GAAP EPS.

The expected P/E is at the high end of Teradyne’s long-term trading range of 12x-26x given TER’s recent and unique exposure to 5G/automation cyclical recovery in auto and industrial markets and market share gains in core semiconductor testing. Downside risks to the investment firm’s price objective are cyclicality and potential loss of market share in the core semiconductor test market along with increasing competition in the robotics segment BoA cautioned.

NVDA Gains Place Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

A BoA buy recommendation NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%.

In addition BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU) as well as its software and development ecosystem BoA added.

Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E excluding cash at the higher-end of NVDA’s historical 20x-54x P/E range showing NVIDIA’s superior long-term growth profile in large underpenetrated markets according to BoA.

Risks to achieving BoA’s price objective include NVDA’s exposure to the personal computer market competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors “lumpy and unpredictable sales” in new enterprise data center and auto markets potential reduced capital returns possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.

Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman

“The semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology” said Bob Carlson chairman of the Board of Trustees of Virginia’s Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. “Asian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.”

The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage said Carlson who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).

Six Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Dodge Worst of COVID-19 Crisis

COVID-19 vaccination progress in recent weeks offers optimism that new cases and deaths due to the virus will keep slowing. Additional hope comes from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowing a third COVID-19 vaccine to be put in to use.

Worldwide COVID-19 cases have jumped to 159697341 with deaths of 3317685 as of May 12 according to Johns Hopkins University. Also on that date U.S. COVID-19 cases have totaled 32778621 and led to 582845 deaths. America has the dreaded distinction as the country with the most COVID-19 cases and deaths.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now provide investors with ways to pursue profits from a $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package increased COVID-19 vaccine availability and an ongoing economic reopening. Those catalysts seem destined to build momentum for the six semiconductor stocks to buy now.

Meanwhile the last year's lockdown probably saw you ordering more takeout and delivery than ever. Unfortunately these two trends conflict in a way you might want to know about. With pizza as the most-ordered food this past year advocates are calling out America's biggest pizza brand for inhumane treatment of the animals that become our food.

Late Friday animal advocacy group The Humane League contacted Eat This Not That! editors with a report that may warrant awareness. In the report entitled ""The Price of a Slice"" the organization states that 200 food companies have willingly committed to a new chicken welfare policy that eliminates the cruelest factory farming practices from their supply chains. Those companies that have committed to good for chickens include well known brands like Chipotle Burger King Popeyes Papa John's Starbucks Subway Denny's and more.

This Is the Best Supermarket in America New Survey Says

While a lot of fast food brands family restaurants and manufacturers like General Mills and Kraft Heinz appear on the list of companies that have committed to kinder chicken welfare the number of pizza chains leaves plenty to be desired. The Humane League says big pizza brands have failed to commit to the same animal welfare supply chain practices. The list of these chains includes Domino's—which is the top-selling pizza in America—along with Pizza Hut Little Caesar's Sbarro Marco's Pizza and many more.

Shown is the Humane League's list of pizza chains they're calling on for better animal welfare practices:

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The Humane League says these pizza chains allow inhumane practices in the treatment of chickens in particular. Here's what they detail:

Crowded by the tens of thousands into sheds with no room to move around. Standing in their own waste because their sheds are almost never cleaned during their lifetime. Bred to grow so heavy at such a rapid rate that many can't even stand up. Killed using a brutal system called ""live-shackle slaughter"" leaving half a million chickens boiled alive each year. These pizza restaurants allow this to go on every day. They have refused to ban these practices from their supply chains and they have never released a public statement about their standards for chicken welfare.

We all know that making the healthier more conscious transition to eating less meat products takes sacrifice intention and commitment. But the insights we gain from reports like this might better inform where we want to order from next time the house has a craving for barbecue chicken pizza wings or chicken tenders.

The CEO of Kroger America’s largest grocery store chain has been criticised for receiving a record $22.4million in compensation after slashing key workers’ $2-an-hour Covid-19 hazard pay last year according to reports.

At the start of the pandemic Kroger chief executive Rodney McMullen announced a “Hero Bonus” for staff who were applauded for being key workers and keeping shelves stocked during the outbreak.

Kroger which employs around 465000 staff across 2640 stores saw profits rise last year from $122.29billion in 2019 to $132.5bn as widespread Covid lockdowns prevented people from eating out.

In May 2020 Kroger announced that hazard pay was being cut for employees in warehouses and stores where states allowed them to do so. In states where hazard pay is still required Kroger have opted to close stores.

But according to a Bloomberg report this week on a Kroger regulatory filing Mr McMullen was awarded $22.4m in compensation in 2020 by the company a 6 per cent jump on the previous year.

Last year median pay for Kroger’s workers fell 8 per cent to an annual $24600. Full-time workers were awarded a bonus of $300.

The Independent has contacted Kroger for comment.

Following news of the Kroger CEO’s bumper payout Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal tweeted: “How interesting. Kroger claimed they needed to close 2 Seattle stores because they couldn’t afford hazard pay for essential workers—but they could give their CEO his largest salary ever? Pay your workers. We know you can.”

Maria Hernandez worked for Kroger in Los Angeles before her store was shut down following a dispute over hazard pay rules in California.

She told The Guardian: “Why are they punishing us? If it weren’t for us they couldn’t run the stores. As a person we have value. As workers we have value. They don’t seem to care about you as a human being. They don’t care.”

John Grant president of labor union United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770 in LA said the action punished workers.

“They are as best we can tell the only grocery chain that is acting punitively and trying to punish workers in the community” he said.

Dan Price CEO of Seattle-based online credit card processing company Gravity Payments who famously cut his own pay by millions so all employees could make a minimum of $70000 tweeted a list of criticisms of Kroger.

He wrote on Friday: “Pandemic profits grew 70% to $2.8 billion... Doubled buybacks and dividends to $1.9 billion... Closed stores and laid off 250 workers where cities required $4/hour hazard pay... Cut median worker pay 8% to $24000... Gave CEO 6% raise to $22.4 million.”

A Kroger spokesperson told Bloomberg that workers will receive $100 for getting vaccinated against Covid and added: “Kroger continues to reward and recognize our associates for their incredible work during this historic time.”

According to the Wall Street Journal billionaires increased their wealth by 54 per cent during the pandemic.

Three Kroger-operated supermarkets in Los Angeles were set to permanently shut down in what the company said was the result of the city's ""hero pay""

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Three Kroger-operated supermarkets in Los Angeles were set to permanently shut down in what the company said was the result of the city's ""hero pay""

The store shelves were nearly empty at the Food 4 Less location at 5420 East Sunset Boulevard in East Hollywood where the store's signature sign above the front entrance had already been removed.

Two Ralphs stores were also shutting down located at 9616 West Pico Boulevard and 3300 West Slauson Avenue.

The closures come after the city of Los Angeles voted to require grocery chains to pay workers an additional $5 per hour for approximately four months.

Kroger chose instead to shutter the three stores saying the locations were already struggling. The company will continue to operate 65 other locations in L.A.

'Hero pay': LA City Council votes to finalize $5 an hour emergency ordinance amid pandemic

The Los Angeles City Council finalized an emergency ordinance to require large grocery and pharmacy retailers to offer employees an additional $5 per hour in hazard pay.

Customers at the East Hollywood location on Saturday morning express mixed feelings about the development.

""I mean they're coming in here to work especially dealing with people all the time it's a risk for them and their families"" said Alex Hernandez referring to workplace risks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I think it's fair to get a little bit of extra pay.""

Don Hill said he didn't like ""the idea that the groceries have to pay an additional $5 an hour.""

""I'm a union guy myself always have been"" Hill said. ""But no if the city wants to run the grocery business then they should have publicly owned grocery stores.""

Kroger has also closed two other locations in Long Beach after that city also approved a ""hero pay"" ordinance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3Mvc3VycHJpc2UtY2RjLXJldmVyc2FsLW1hc2tzLWxlYXZlcy1zdGF0ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1zY3JhbWJsaW5nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3NjkxNzY50gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvUG9saXRpY3Mvc3VycHJpc2UtY2RjLXJldmVyc2FsLW1hc2tzLWxlYXZlcy1zdGF0ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1zY3JhbWJsaW5nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3NjkxNzY5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surprise! CDC reversal on masks leaves states businesses scrambling,"If you’re going to CVS or Target bring your mask. But if you swing by Trader Joe’s or Starbucks you can leave it in the car assuming you are fully vaccinated of course. That said if you’re taking public transportation to get there you’ll need to mask up for the ride.

After 405 days of urging every man woman and child to wear a mask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stunned much of the nation this week -- including health experts – with its recommendations that vaccinated Americans can mostly ditch the mask. The decision left businesses governors and schools scrambling to respond and an emerging hodgepodge of rules for masks depending upon which state county or store a person is in.

The new CDC proposal also raises serious questions: Can employers require proof of vaccination before a worker goes mask-free? Should businesses ask patrons to present proof upon entry? Could teens eligible for the vaccine be denied access to a classroom without a mask if they aren’t vaccinated?

Governors said they weren’t briefed in advance on the plan despite 24 states and the District of Columbia having some sort of state-wide mask mandate in place at the time of the announcement.

""We were as surprised as anyone by the CDC’s announcement – learning about it through the press"" said Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire calling CDC messaging in recent months ""inconsistent convoluted and ever changing.""

In Maine Gov. Janet Mills told reporters she was ""anxious"" to hear from the CDC how to distinguish between vaccinated the unvaccinated people. But by Friday Mills announced she was on board and that the state would adopt the CDC guidance as state policy.

Several health experts also said were caught off guard assuming new mask recommendations would come when more Americans were fully vaccinated. Nearly 36% of the U.S. population is vaccinated and the pace of shots has declined.

""I thought it would be prudent to wait until everyone who is willing (ages 12 and up) has had an opportunity to be fully vaccinated around July 1"" said Linsey Marr a virus transmission expert at Virginia Tech.

Dr. Leana Wen an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University's Milken School of Public Health tweeted: ""I’m still stunned at the CDC decision.""

The White House too claimed to be unaware of precisely what the new recommendation would be making the case that the CDC came to its conclusion without political pressure. Press secretary Jen Psaki said only a ""small number"" of people at the White House knew about the proposal Wednesday night.

""The White House was informed of that decision just to give people assurance of that"" Psaski told reporters Friday.

When asked what the CDC guidance means for Biden’s executive order that mandates masks be worn on federal property Psaki said it may take a few days for any possible changes but she expects ""the guidelines will be the guide.""

""We're working to implement those [guidelines] across the government"" she said.

Several big-chain stores also seemed surprised firing off terse statements that mask mandates would remain in place until they had a chance to review the new recommendations and determine which businesses might be subject to local mandates.

""These conflicting positions put retailers and their employees in incredibly difficult situations"" said Lisa LaBruno a senior executive vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

For its part the CDC defended the new guidance as a natural next step based on emerging scientific evidence including fresh studies that the vaccines were holding up against variants of the virus and cutting asymptomatic transmission. The CDC also cited plummeting case numbers and a recent decision by regulators that kids as young as 12 now qualify for vaccination.

""We have had a coalescence of more science that has emerged just in the last week"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky director of the CDC told reporters when asked what had changed in the past 16 days since the agency last released mask guidance.

Under the new recommendations people who are fully immunized should feel safe removing their masks in almost all circumstances even indoors and in a crowd. The guidelines call for masks to still be worn on planes trains and buses as well as homeless shelters hospitals and prisons.

While the CDC insisted its decision was grounded in science it seemed to acknowledge that it was unprepared to answer the questions that would come with it. In an interview with NPR’s ""All Things Considered"" Walensky said the recommendation would trigger a review of other guidance.

""What we really need to do now as an agency is comb all of our guidance not just for travel but for schools and for camps and for child care centers and for all of the guidance that we have out there … And that is going to be the work of the weeks ahead that we have in the agency"" Walensky told NPR on Thursday.

John Brownstein chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor said one primary concern is that the U.S. is still experiencing active disease transmission with more than 35000 COVID cases a day. Also some vulnerable populations including children don't have the option of getting vaccinated.

That puts everyone on the honor system and many people and businesses confused on how exactly to stay safe he said.

""Americans are feeling incredible whiplash"" Brownstein said.

They don’t like that because well they generally don’t come equipped with the hardware that would allow them to safely fly in a shared environment.

Such hardware is generally known as sense and avoid and it is designed to do exactly that: detect what’s happening around the drone and if need be move it out of the way autonomously to avoid collisions.Military drones don’t usually come with sense and avoid simply because up until now they’ve been lone killer wolves raining death and electronic surveillance from above. But as the needs and expectations of the military shift they’ll kind of have to mingle.With that in mind the U.S. Navy Northrop Grumman  and a joint venture between L3Harris and Thales called Aviation Communications & Surveillance Systems (ACSS) have been working for the past five years in coming up with a decent sense and avoid system.The technology is meant for the MQ-4C Triton autonomous drone and if successful it will allow the machine not only to fly alongside other aircraft but also take off and land “out of almost any airfield or airport in the world in full compliance with current and emerging aviation regulations around the globe.”The Triton had its first flight in 2013 and just a small number of them are currently deployed by the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. Derived from the Global Hawk  it was designed with a wide range of missions in mind from maritime ISR patrol signals intelligence search and rescue and communications relay.The main thing going for this drone is the fact that it can stay in the air for 24 hours at a time an altitudes of more than 10 miles (16 km) and can cover distances of up to 9400 miles (15100 km).The companies involved did not say how long it will be before the prototype of the system will be ready for testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1500-2000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals BoA reported.

The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus the impact of the ongoing chip shortage is not limited to semiconductor stocks since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle BoA noted.

Similar to industrial stocks semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus in 5G broadband and domestic chip manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist in semiconductor stocks they are offset by “solid visibility” that is driven by non-cancellable orders product customization and broad-based demand BoA concluded.

Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in gross margins signaling that semiconductor companies are “very effective” in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a positive driver for the sector BoA noted. As a result the SOX index has benefitted from rising rates historically.

“Over the past five years chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X” said Hilary Kramer who hosts the nationally aired “Millionaire Maker” radio program and heads the GameChangers and Value Authority advisory services.

Value investments had been trouncing growth stocks heading into trading on May 11 with the Russell 3000 Value Index up 19.1% in 2021 compared to a gain of 4.3% for the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested “a rest” would be overdue and healthy for the market.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates suggesting the market growth will last beyond 2022 Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage semiconductor stocks have not performed well since early April.

Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is “not great” but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

The top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) a Santa Clara California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA’s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS) above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers.

Potential catalysts for AMAT’s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity upgrades market share loss in key segments merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds BoA noted.

AMAT and two other large U.S.-based semiconductor vendors — Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) a Fremont California-based provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to help chipmakers build smaller and faster electronic devices and KLA Corp. (NASDAQ:KLAC) a semiconductor capital equipment company in Milpitas California trade at 20x average forward P/E. That P/E is two turns below the broad market despite solid multi-year visibility strong balance sheets and potential double-digit-percentage sales and EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next 3-5 years BoA noted.

Lam Research Ranks Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

BoA gave Lam Research a $725 price target based on 20x cash adjusted 2022E P/E within the stock’s historical range of 8x-24x and based on LRCX’s 20%-plus EPS growth rate. Amid a multi-year wafer fabrication equipment growth cycle LRCX is well positioned to benefit the investment firm wrote.

Potential upside catalysts to LRCX’s price objective are stronger-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity increased semiconductor equipment sales and improved market share. Downside risks are a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity additions and a market share loss.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Include U.S.-based KLA Corp.

KLA Corp. gained a $400 price objective from BoA based on 22x 2022E P/E within KLAC’s historical range of 10x-26x. The investment firm envisions KLAC as a key enabler of semiconductor manufacturing technology offering a less cyclical topline industry leading profit margins and best-in-class shareholder returns.

Risks to BoA’s price objective for KLAC are the cyclical nature of semiconductor capital spending and its impact on earnings as well as competitive price and market share issues particularly against Applied Materials. Another vulnerability would occur if trouble arose in bringing new products and technologies to market BoA cautioned.

Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI) a Rehovot Israel-based provider of metrology devices for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing received a $108 price objective from BoA based on 34x a 2022 estimated non-GAAP EPS that includes stock compensation and adjustments for net cash. The valuation is within its peer range of 20x-40x and is justified BoA noted due to Nova’s superior gross margin profile and its potential to outgrow the market in the next three years.

Downside risks for the stock could include an inability to earn share in new X-Ray metrology market stiff competition from large rivals such as KLA Corp. and historically cyclical semiconductor capital spending. Nonetheless BoA lists NVMI among the six best semiconductor stocks.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Feature Teradyne

Another of the six best semiconductor stocks to buy now is Teradyne Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) a North Reading Massachusetts-based maker of automatic test equipment. BoA’s $155 price objective on TER is based on 25x P/E applied to a fiscal year 2022 estimated Non-GAAP EPS.

The expected P/E is at the high end of Teradyne’s long-term trading range of 12x-26x given TER’s recent and unique exposure to 5G/automation cyclical recovery in auto and industrial markets and market share gains in core semiconductor testing. Downside risks to the investment firm’s price objective are cyclicality and potential loss of market share in the core semiconductor test market along with increasing competition in the robotics segment BoA cautioned.

NVDA Gains Place Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

A BoA buy recommendation NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%.

In addition BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU) as well as its software and development ecosystem BoA added.

Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E excluding cash at the higher-end of NVDA’s historical 20x-54x P/E range showing NVIDIA’s superior long-term growth profile in large underpenetrated markets according to BoA.

Risks to achieving BoA’s price objective include NVDA’s exposure to the personal computer market competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors “lumpy and unpredictable sales” in new enterprise data center and auto markets potential reduced capital returns possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.

Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman

“The semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology” said Bob Carlson chairman of the Board of Trustees of Virginia’s Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. “Asian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.”

The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage said Carlson who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).

The top holdings in PSI recently were Applied Materials (AMAT) Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) Texas Instruments (TXN) Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) Carlson said.

According to a study by the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori) more than 51 per cent of Hongkongers identified as Chinese during the Beijing Olympics the highest level since the survey started in 1997.

Local residents took pride in China winning 51 gold medals at the Games that year surpassing America’s 36 and mainland officials could be confident that most Hongkongers were feeling sufficiently patriotic.

It may sound surreal now but tens of thousands of Hongkongers turned out to cheer for the Beijing Olympic torch relay when it came to the city in 2008.

In the third instalment of our Tokyo Trail series on key issues surrounding the Olympics we look at why Hong Kong’s government snapped up broadcast rights to the Games.

Attempts to introduce a national education curriculum in Hong Kong schools backfired in 2012. A perceived lack of democratic progress in the city triggered the 79-day Occupy protests in 2014 and subsequently fuelled separatist sentiments.

By 2019 when an ill-fated extradition bill sparked months of anti-government protests  only 20.9 per cent Hongkongers saw themselves as Chinese a record low.

The number climbed to 29.2 per cent in the latest survey carried out last December despite the introduction in June 2020 of a controversial national security law that critics say is so broad that it could be used to crack down on dissent. Even so sentiment remains far from those halcyon days of 2008.

It was against such a backdrop that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced on Tuesday she would use an undisclosed sum of public money to purchase the broadcasting rights for the Tokyo Olympics  so that residents could watch the Games for free while also “showing support for national and local athletes”.

Lam later described her move as widely welcomed by the community especially the sports sector while veteran pro-Beijing politician Tam Yiu-chung went further suggesting the government purchase the broadcasting rights for all future Games.

Critics and academics took an opposite view. They said the purchase set a precedent of interference in a free economy. They also suspected a hidden agenda warning that any attempt to use the Games to enhance national identity or ease tensions between the government and the public would be doomed to fail.

The deputy executive director of Pori Chung Kim-wah said the government had failed to grasp the current political climate in which people were indifferent and cold towards whatever it did.

“People are just treating [the Games] as another television show while young people might not even feel interested watching it” he said. “Residents were hopeful in 2008 [after the government’s first attempt at a] national security law did not pass in 2003 but that sense of optimism has faded in the last decade.”

Just another show?

With two months to go before the Tokyo Games begin the city’s leader with the home affairs minister by her side took everyone by surprise when she announced that the government had closed a deal with the Japanese media firm Dentsu which holds the broadcast rights for much of Asia.

Explaining the extraordinary move Lam said she had first had the idea after Hong Kong’s success at the 2018 Asian Games and she then instructed the Home Affairs Bureau to look into it in May 2019.

But the time was now ripe for the government to make this “one-off” arrangement because of the state of the coronavirus -hit economy with advertising spending down 20 per cent over the past year and none of the city’s commercial broadcasters able to reach an agreement she said.

Lam said it would be a great pity if the people of Hong Kong were denied the chance to watch the Games and to cheer on all the athletes representing mainland China and Hong Kong.

A government source with direct knowledge of the deal denied the purchase had anything to do with the political climate or national identity but admitted it would cause “no harm if Hongkongers feel happier watching the Games supporting national and local athletes” after the “series of events” the city had experienced.

“It was not an abrupt decision but one which was planned before the movements” the source said.

Speaking anonymously Lam’s advisers in the Executive Council said due to the confidentiality of such commercial deals they were not notified about the decision until the day of Lam’s public announcement.

“Lam just said that the government was spending less than the HK$120 million a local television station spent in bidding for the broadcasting rights of the London 2012 Olympics” the source said. “That’s not a really big amount so I guess the government can make the call and there was no need to do consultations.”

“I would not say the Games could enhance people’s sense of national identity like in 2008 but after all it’s not a bad thing as people can have something to watch and discuss apart from the pandemic” the adviser said.

Tam Yiu-chung said the pro-establishment parties had long urged the government to pay for the shows “for the sake of Hong Kong people”.

“It depends on how people interpret the matter politically. For me it is great that people can watch the Chinese team and the Hong Kong team and cheer for them” he said.

“I think the government should not make it a one-off arrangement. It should do the same in the future as the price is too high when broadcasting companies compete with one another or the government can invite the Jockey Club to make deals for international games as the club’s target is to promote sports.”

International sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup had in the past been effective at boosting national pride academics said. But their effectiveness depended on how people perceived their governments at the time.

GOLDEN MOMENTS

During the 1984 Games in Los Angeles Chinese gymnast Li Ning became a household name in Hong Kong after winning three gold medals.

Over the years Hongkongers have also squeezed together at homes and electronic stores to watch the Chinese women’s volleyball team compete a time when shouts and cheers can be heard in the streets.

But the days when Hongkongers cared about the performance of mainland China’s athletes may be fading said Chung of Pori.

During the Rio Games in 2016 Hongkongers were most supportive of local athletes when they were pitted against mainland China competitors Chung pointed out while enthusiasm faded further following the Occupy movement and the rise of localist sentiment. At times social media was flooded with mean-spirited comments after some of mainland China’s top hopes suffered setbacks.

Chung said that in the past the central government would arrange for gold medallists to visit Hong Kong as a “soft tactic” to boost people’s patriotism but such moves were getting “less and less effective” with only supporters of the government finding such celebrations enjoyable.

“Statistically there has been no improvement in Hong Kong people recognising themselves as Chinese nor did they endorse any government officials in the current administration” he said adding that only 4 per cent of people in the 18-29 age group identified as Chinese.

“The national security law is one thing but people are also unhappy with the [Carrie Lam] administration during which we have suffered from the pandemic and a high unemployment rate while people seem to be unable to complain or reflect their discontent” Chung added.

A study by Chinese University’s Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies also concluded that the public’s feelings of national identity had peaked in 2008. The university has not done the survey in recent years.

Stephen Chiu Wing-kai who used to carry out the CUHK survey before he left to work as chair professor of sociology at Education University in 2017 said international sports events could enhance people’s sense of patriotism and this was particularly so when Hong Kong had a more liberal government in the first 10 years after the handover from British rule in 1997.

“The sense of positive feelings reached a peak level in 2008. That May people sympathised with the victims of the Sichuan earthquake that happened on the mainland while supporting the Olympics in August and such a sense of patriotism went downhill in the last decade gradually and unavoidably after each political crisis happened” he said.

“The city is now quite divided with young people disapproving of the government while some elderly people have actually become more patriotic after the anti-government movement. I do think the government has made a wise move as most television channels will be playing the Games now even though not many people are interested in watching. Somehow it may bring positive effects” Chiu added.

Professor Michael Davis formerly a legal academic at the University of Hong Kong said Hongkongers had long held contradictory feelings – wanting to identify with the mainland while at the same time distrusting the current ruling regime – but they were still hopeful in 2008 that the “one country two systems” principle under which Hong Kong enjoys freedoms and civil liberties not found on the mainland would endure.

“An easing of the recent repressive policies in Hong Kong and on the mainland would have the most positive effect in [helping people] identify with China” he said. “Ultimately a return to the commitments for democratic reform and the rule of law as those commitments stood in 2008 would be more effective than the current policies in generating those sorts of patriotic feelings.”

Lam’s television deal which marks a major policy U-turn as previous administrations have rejected public calls to bid for broadcasting rights for global sporting events also drew criticism from the business sector.

David Webb a long-time city investor and founder of Webb-site which provides reports on the city’s affairs said the deal was “just another example of mainland-style central planning that the government is nowadays engaging in”.

“Having done this once the government will now be expected to intervene in future so the broadcasters will think ‘why should we pay if the government will pay for us?’ The intervention removes competitive market forces and thins out the advertising or subscription revenue across multiple stations” he said.

Webb was “utterly unconvinced” by Lam’s claim to have planned the purchase since 2018 citing how commerce minister Edward Yau Tang-wah had said in the same year that the government should not intervene in the bidding process for such events.

“The move also sets a dangerous precedent – can we expect the government to bid for various European soccer leagues’ TV rights and compete with the commercial stations for those rights? How about World Cup soccer or Formula One racing?” Webb asked.

“Whatever the economic conditions it is up to broadcasters to decide whether there is likely to be enough viewer interest in the event to bid and for the licence-holder to decide what price and other terms they are willing to accept.”",,,,,,

Poker players are starting to look each other in the eye again.

The plexiglass dividers that have been a staple of Las Vegas poker rooms during the coronavirus pandemic have come down this week at several casinos after they were approved to return to 100 percent capacity by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The Orleans on Saturday became the latest poker room to remove its plexiglass.

“It is down as of early this morning!” Orleans poker room manager Garrett Okahara said via email.

Poker rooms that have removed the plexiglass include the Caesars Entertainment properties (Bally’s Caesars Palace Flamingo and Planet Hollywood Resort); MGM Resorts properties (Aria Bellagio and MGM Grand); Station Casinos properties (Boulder Station Red Rock Resort and Santa Fe Station); and Wynn Las Vegas (room located in Encore).

The Golden Nugget South Point and The Venetian still have plexiglass in place.

The removal of plexiglass dividers signals a return to normalcy for poker in Las Vegas after it was upended along with most other pastimes by the pandemic.

Casinos reopened June 5 after the initial shutdown because of the pandemic in March 2020 and the Orleans and South Point immediately brought back their poker rooms. The Venetian followed the next day and more rooms gradually came back over the next few months.

Games started with four players allowed at each table under social distancing guidelines then five-handed games were quickly approved. While many poker players returned to action the games were a far cry from the normal nine- and 10-handed tables.

The Bellagio opened a new phase of pandemic poker when it installed plexiglass dividers that allowed six-handed games starting June 18. The other poker rooms quickly followed suit.

Eventually regulators allowed rooms to offer eight-handed games with dividers and that remained the standard until this week.

So far most of the rooms that have removed the dividers have chosen to stick with eight-handed play instead of reverting to the normal nine or 10. The Wynn is playing nine-handed and the Orleans said it would go to nine-handed for tournaments while sticking with eight-handed for cash games.

“Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year” the Orleans poker room posted on Twitter.

Good morning poker players! With the recent removal of our plexiglass dividers tournaments at the Orleans will be played 9-handed effective immediately. Cash games will still be 8-handed for the time being. Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year. — OrleansPokerRoom (@OrleansPokerRo1) May 15 2021

With face masks now optional at many resorts for fully vaccinated patrons poker this summer could look like what it was before the pandemic.

Henderson poker pro and YouTube personality Jeff Sluzinski who goes by Jeff Boski online hailed the removal of plexiglass Friday.

“A timeless moment in poker history” he said on Twitter.

The world lost one of its greatest musical talents when John was horrifically killed outside his New York home on December 8 1980 aged just 40. But the star also left behind one son who was still a little boy and another he had seemingly abandoned years before and with whom was just starting to rebuild and fragile new relationship. The former Beatle was also on the cusp of relaunching his music career whe everything was so tragically ripped away. Sean and Julian had very different upbringings on either side of the Atlantic but have forged their own bond in recent years and they opened up recently about what binds them together and their memories of their father.

Julian was born while John was still married to Cynthia Lennon. The Beatles were already starting to become a global sensation and John was rarely at home. Julian inspired the songs Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and Hey Jude but was closer to Paul McCartney. In fact the latter song (originally called Hey Jules for Julian) was written by Paul to comfort the young boy during his parents divorce in 1968 when he was only five. In 1968 John married Yoko Ono and soon moved permanently to New York. Sean was born in 1975. He too was only five when he lost his father but in an even more devastating way. Julian has spoken angrily in the past about how he was neglected by his father throughout his youth but recently he opened up about their improved relationship in John's final days.

The U.S. Space Force’s fifth Space Based Infrared System or SBIRS satellite was built by Lockheed Martin and cost approximately $1 billion military officials said. The spacecraft carries infrared sensors to detect and track hot plumes from missile launches around the world giving warning to U.S. and allied military forces of an impending attack.

The SBIRS GEO 5 satellite is heading for a perch in a circular geosynchronous orbit more than 22000 miles (nearly 36000 kilometers) over the equator joining a fleet of infrared sentinels spread around the world watching for missile launches.

“SBIRS capability really remains an on-orbit guardian for us against global ballistic missile threats” said Col. Erin Gulden mission director for the SBIRS GEO 5 mission at the Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center which manages procurement of military satellites.

The SBIRS GEO 5 satellite is closed up inside the nose cone of a ULA Atlas 5 rocket for launch from Cape Canaveral during a 40-minute window opening at 1:35 p.m. EDT (1735 GMT) Monday. Forecasters predict a 90% chance of favorable weather for launch Monday.

The 194-foot-tall (59-meter) Atlas 5 rocket emerged from ULA’s Vertical Integration Facility for the third-of-a-mile (550-meter) rollout to pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Saturday. Pushed along rail tracks the Atlas 5 on its mobile launch table arrived at pad 41 Saturday morning to begin final countdown preparations.

ULA ground crews connected the rocket and its mobile launch platform to ground systems at pad 41 mating electrical data and fluid lines to prepare for Monday’s countdown.

Teams loaded 25000 gallons of RP-1 kerosene fuel into the Atlas 5’s first stage Saturday afternoon. The storable room-temperature fuel will remain on the rocket until launch when the first stage’s Russian-made RD-180 engine will consume the kerosene in combination with super-cold liquid oxygen.

The Atlas 5’s supply of cryogenic liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen which fuels the rocket’s Centaur upper stage will be pumped into the rocket during the countdown Monday.

The Atlas 5 launcher that will deliver the SBIRS GEO 5 spacecraft to orbit will fly in the “421” configuration with a 4-meter and two strap-on solid rocket boosters supplied by Aerojet Rocketdyne. A single RL10 engine from Aerojet Rocketdyne will power the Atlas 5’s Centaur upper stage.

The launch will mark the eighth flight of the Atlas 5-421 variant and the 87th launch of an Atlas 5 rocket since its debut in 2002.

The Atlas 5 rocket launching Monday will debut an upgraded Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 engine on the Centaur upper stage. The hydrogen-fueled engine’s newest variant called the RL10C-1-1 comes with a performance improvement and is easier to build according to ULA.

The RL10C-1-1 engine has a larger nozzle than the engines flown on previous Atlas 5 rockets and introduces a new 3D-printed injector which is flying on its first operational mission said Gary Wentz vice president of government and commercial programs at ULA.

According to Aerojet Rocketdyne’s website the RL10C-1-1 engine produces about 1000 pounds of additional thrust over the RL10C-1 engine version used on previous Atlas 5 rockets.

More than 500 RL10 engines have flown on rockets since the 1960s. ULA’s Vulcan Centaur rocket will also use the RL10C-1-1 engine variant as will all future Atlas 5s except missions with Boeing’s Starliner crew capsule which uses a unique dual-engine Centaur upper stage.

The Atlas 5 rocket launching the SBIRS GEO 5 mission will head east from Cape Canaveral after liftoff Monday. The launcher’s two solid rocket boosters providing about half the launcher’s 1.6 million pounds of thrust at liftoff will consume their pre-packed propellant in about a minute-and-a-half then jettison to fall into the Atlantic Ocean at T+plus 2 minutes 9 seconds.

The strap-on boosters were supplied by Aerojet Rocketdyne. ULA is switching to Northrop Grumman-built solid rocket boosters for most future Atlas 5 launches plus all missions using the company’s next-generation Vulcan Centaur rocket.

Aerojet Rocketdyne’s solid-fueled motors will continue launching Atlas 5 rockets carrying crew missions into orbit but Monday’s mission is the last military-procured Atlas 5 flight to use the old booster design. The Aerojet Rocketdyne boosters were certified for astronaut launches.

The first stage’s Russian-made RD-180 main engine will shut down at T+plus 4 minutes 10 seconds followed by stage separation six seconds later. The RL10 engine on the Centaur upper stage will ignite at T+plus 4 minutes 26 seconds for the first of two firings to place the SBIRS GEO 5 spacecraft into an elongated transfer orbit.

After cutoff of the Centaur’s first burn at T+plus 15 minutes 6 seconds the rocket will deploy two suitcase-size secondary payloads named TDO 3 and TDO 4 for the U.S. Air Force Academy.

A second RL10 engine burn will begin at T+plus 31 minutes 6 seconds to maneuver into an orbit closer to the SBIRS GEO 5 spacecraft’s final operating position.

Separation of the Space Force’s new missile warning satellite is expected at T+plus 42 minutes 46 seconds.

The Atlas 5’s guidance computer will aim to release the spacecraft in an orbit ranging in altitude between 575 miles (925 kilometers) and 22216 miles (35753 kilometers) with an inclination angle of 21.14 degrees to the equator.

The SBIRS GEO 5 spacecraft’s on-board propulsion system will steer the satellite to a circular geosynchronous orbit that is continuously at an altitude of nearly 22300 miles over the equator. In that orbit the satellite’s velocity will be fixed with the rate of Earth’s rotation giving the craft’s infrared early warning sensors a constant view of the same part of the planet.

The new satellite differs from the first four SBIRS GEO satellites introducing an upgraded spacecraft design Lockheed Martin calls the “combat bus.” Lockheed Martin built the fifth and sixth SBIRS GEO satellites using its new LM 2100 platform which the company says is the result of an “internally-funded multi-year modernization initiative.”

In a pre-launch press briefing Gulden said the “enhanced resiliency” of the SBIRS GEO 5 and GEO 6 satellites will “expand national intelligence gathering” and improve the military’s situational awareness.

“The need for SBIRS systems has never been more critical” said Tom McCormick SBIRS program manager at Lockheed Martin. “The threat of ballistic missile technology is spreading around the world.”

McCormick said SBIRS satellites detected and tracked more than 1000 missile launches around the world in 2020.

“With early missile warning SBIRS infrared detection capability serve as a tip of the spear or bell ringer that a launch has occurred and something is coming” McCormick said. “SBIRS data informs many of our country’s defense systems which together form a protective missile kill chain to defend our nation and our armed forces.”

According to Lockheed Martin the LM 2100 combat bus is designed with hardening against cyber threats along with additional spacecraft power and enhanced propulsion and electronics. The modular design incorporates common components to streamline manufacturing and can more easily accommodate new types of sensors to respond to innovation and new military requirements.

The LM 2100 combat bus will also be used by the next generation of missile warning satellites Lockheed Martin is building for the Space Force to replace the SBIRS fleet. The next generation of GPS navigation satellite due to begin launching in 2026 will also use the combat bus platform.

The final SBIRS GEO satellite GEO 6 is scheduled of launch on an Atlas 5 rocket in 2022. The first next-gen Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR satellite will launch in 2025 to begin replacing the SBIRS satellites.

Northrop Grumman builds the infrared sensors on the SBIRS satellites.

The SBIRS constellation includes a minimum of four SBIRS craft stationed in geosynchronous orbit and at least two infrared payloads in elliptical orbits aboard top secret National Reconnaissance Office spy satellites providing polar coverage. The final two SBIRS satellites set for launch this year and next year will replenish the fleet.

Each infrared instrument package on the geosynchronous satellites includes staring and scanning sensors designed to provide visibility over an entire hemisphere while allowing ground operators to focus the craft’s gaze on hotspots like North Korea

The military’s first SBIRS satellite launched into geosynchronous orbit in 2011 following a series of Defense Support Program early warning satellites that supplied missile launch data to military commanders beginning in the 1970s.

SBIRS GEO 5 weighs about 10700 pounds (4850 kilograms) fully fueled for launch according to McCormick.

All four SBIRS GEO satellites have launched on Atlas 5 rockets. The rocket assigned to the SBIRS GEO 5 mission uses an extra solid rocket booster — SBIRS GEO 4 launched on an Atlas 5 with a single strap-on motor — providing additional thrust to help put the spacecraft into an orbit slightly closer to the satellite’s final operating perch in geosynchronous orbit.

“SBIRS GEO 5 is the most advanced missile warning satellite built” McCormick said. “With the launch of every SBIRS vehicle we’re increasing our national security posture.”

Here's What You Need to Know: Northrop’s YF-23 may not have been far behind given that the Air Force initially chose both Lockheed and Northrop proposals to build the aircraft. Perhaps both jets could operate at “supercruise” speeds meaning they could achieve prolonged supersonic flight missions without needing its afterburners.

The U.S. Air Force chose to build the F-22 in the 1980s following an extensive and thorough competition a process that appears to have led to the engineering of the most dominant air-to-air platform in the world.

Interestingly there were several other competitors also seeking to build the jet and meet the Air Force’s supercruise thrust stealth and survivability requirements.

In 1986 the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman development deals offering each team 50-months to build and demonstrate a prototype. Lockheed built the YF-22 and Northrop built the YF-23 stealth fighter. Lockheed won a production contract in 1991.

Why was the F-22 chosen given Northrop’s stealth technology expertise with platforms such as the B-2?

There may be many reasons for this most of which are likely not available. Renderings of the YF-23 show a very sleek stealthy-looking airplane. Both the YF-22 and YF-23 had dual-engine exhaust pipes and a blended wing-body configuration. The YF-23 wings looked slightly larger and more diamond-shaped. The exhaust pipe cavities on the YF-23 were slightly more angular. The F-22 fuselage has a greater degree of wing-body blending and a longer more gradual horizontal slope across the top whereas the main fuselage of the YF-23 is slightly more protruded from the wings.

Does this mean that a more angular less-sloped external configuration made the YF-23 less stealthy? After all vertical structures of any kind particularly those which protrude with any kind of angle or larger shape differential might be more susceptible to a radar return signal and therefore possibly be more detectable to enemy air-defense radar. In many respects however images of the two prototypes reveal interesting similarities. Any margin of difference may or may not have been greatly impactful however the F-22 fuselage does look more horizontal and blended.

Whatever the reason the Air Force chose Lockheed YF-22 the experience of engineering the stealth fighter undoubtedly contributed to Northrop’s fighter-jet-construction expertise. It may have informed some elements of Northrop’s design for its B-21 Raider or even contributed to work on a 6th-gen stealth fighter if in fact Northrop has built a prototype for the well-known Next-Generation Air Dominance program. While this is not known as no vendor has officially confirmed the existence of a prototype 6th-Gen plane the Air Force has announced that it has flown one.

The air dominance superiority of the F-22 continues to inspire current Air Force efforts to modernize the stealth fighter and support its plan to fly it quite possibly all the way until 2060. This is being accomplished with software-driven weapons upgrades stealth coating improvements communications enhancements and a new generation of radars and sensors for the fighter. Most of all this is likely the case given the widespread consensus that the F-22 is simply unparalleled in terms of performance speed maneuverability and dogfighting capability.

Northrop’s YF-23 may not have been far behind given that the Air Force initially chose both Lockheed and Northrop proposals to build the aircraft. Perhaps both jets could operate at “supercruise” speeds meaning they could achieve prolonged supersonic flight missions without needing its afterburners. This of course massively extends mission effectiveness overall speed time to target and dwell time enabling greater target acquisition as well.

The official in charge of purchasing military hardware for the US Air Force suggested slashing the total number of Lockheed Martin F-35 jets for the service by more than half late last year according to two former defense officials involved in the discussions who spoke with CNN. The news comes as Congressional criticism of the most expensive weapons program in US history grows.

Will Roper who served as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Technology and Logistics for the last three years of the Trump administration recommended that Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Brown former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord and others reduce the number of jets purchased from 1763 jets to about 800 the officials said. Roper questioned the cost of the jet even after former President Donald Trump touted it as “invisible” and the greatest fighter jet in the world.

Instead Roper threw his support behind the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program a secretive sixth-generation aircraft designed with digital engineering the officials said. He revealed last October at the Air Space & Cyber Conference that a full-scale prototype had flown and “broken a lot of records in the doing.”

Though the plan was not accepted the revelation come as the F-35 program faces growing scrutiny with increased skepticism from members of Congress and suggestions within the Pentagon that all is not well with the military’s prized program.

“There is recognition from everyone involved in this program – from the Air Force and from everyone in Congress – that this is a challenge. This program is not working out the way we wanted it to” said a source with direct knowledge of the F-35 program. According to the source an Air Force official said in a closed door meeting “At this point we paid for ‘outstanding.’ We got ‘very good.’”

In this case “very good” comes with a staggering price tag.

The total cost over the life of the F-35 program is estimated to be $1.7 trillion according to the Defense Department’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. The vast majority of that money – $1.27 trillion – is sustainment costs not the cost of buying the jets but the costs to keep them flying.

Any cuts would have huge ramifications

The military plans to purchase nearly 2500 F-35s in total. A reduction in the Air Force purchase to approximately 800 jets could potentially reduce sustainment costs by some $400 billion. A cut that large would affect not only Lockheed Martin but an industrial base across the country that supports the manufacture of the aircraft. A company executive said at a House Armed Services Committee Hearing in late-April that the US supply chain is more than 1800 companies of which about 1000 are small or disadvantaged businesses.

Ellen Lord the former chief of Pentagon acquisitions under the Trump administration said there is a debate within the Pentagon about how to prioritize the mature F-35 program against the unproven NGAD. Lord was one of those in the department to whom Roper suggested cutting the Air Force’s F-35 purchase.

Speaking with CNN she emphasized the importance of the overall F-35 program especially its interoperability with key allies and partners.

“It’s important to realize the difference between one prototype that has shown potential and the ability to guarantee a product that can generate multiple aircraft per month. We must be very careful not to discard a concept that has been built up over time” she said. “The debate is about the degree to which you can reduce the F-35 to put money into NGAD. Right now [the F-35] is performing very very well for the Air Force Navy and the Marines. The pilots love it when they go downrange.”

But Lord said the sustainment costs of the fighter must come down.

Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the service is still “fully committed” to the F-35. At the same time she said the Air Force is working to find “the fighter force mix that best meets the challenges of the highly contested environment.”

“In addition to the aircraft we are procuring now we are looking at affordable capacity and capability for the future and determining where we should invest our R&D money using a digital approach so we have the right fighter mix 15-20 years from now” Stefanek said in a statement to CNN.

In its latest report on F-35 sustainment released last month the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the program was projected to be $6 billion short in the year 2036 alone. The problem is sharpest for the Air Force where the GAO found that the estimated cost of the F-35s was 47% higher than what the Air Force said it could afford.

“The services have a plane that they cannot afford to fly the way they want to fly at least in the long run” Maurer said at the House Armed Services Committee hearing about the F-35 last month.

F-35 program plagued by problems

The program which will mark its 20th anniversary this October has not yet completed its testing or entered full production despite being operational in the field and it has been plagued by cost overruns and delays for years including a shortage of 800 engines by 2030. Across the Air Force Navy and Marines the F-35 remains well below its target full mission capable rate which is the rate at which it can perform all of its intended missions. The Navy F-35 is fully mission capable only 7% of the time according to the GAO.

“It’s more expensive than we expected it to be. It’s taking longer than we expected it to take. The engine breaks down more quickly than we expected it to and is more expensive and time-consuming to fix than we expected it to be” said Rep. Adam Smith chairman of the House Armed Services Committee speaking with CNN. “We do not yet have the full capability that has been promised in terms of what the F-35 can do.”

Brett Ashworth a spokesman for Lockheed Martin said the company still sees strong support for the F-35. “Recently the Chief of Staff of the Air Force called the F-35 the cornerstone of the U.S. Air Force fighter fleet. The importance of the F-35 to the US Air Force was highlighted by recent deployments to the CENTCOM area of responsibility in which the Air Force flew more than 1300 sorties completing their mission and returning the pilots home safely every time” he said in a statement to CNN.

Dramatically reducing the purchase of the country’s latest fighter aircraft is not without precedent. In 1997 the Air Force planned to purchase more than 400 Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors. At the time the stealth Raptor was being developed as the most advanced fighter jet in the world. But spiraling costs led to the purchase of only 187 aircraft before the production line was shut down.

The Air Force acknowledged similar problems with the cost of the F-35 in response to the GAO report. “Air Force officials told us that as a result the only remaining options for their meeting their affordability constraints are to reduce the total number of F-35A aircraft they plan to purchase or to reduce the aircraft’s planned flying hours” the GAO report stated.

In January acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller called the F-35 a “piece of …” and said “We’ve created a monster” in comments made just days before he left office. A month later Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Brown referenced the F-35’s costs to operate when he likened it to a “Ferrari” and said its use should be moderated. Brown called to develop a “fifth-gen minus” aircraft. In March Rep. Smith was far more blunt in his assessment saying he wants to stop “throwing money down that particular rathole.”

F-35 program has some staunch supporters

Rep. Donald Norcross a member of the House Armed Services committee told CNN that it will be difficult to reduce the cost of a program that has completed much of its design and development even as he called the jet “remarkable.”

“The reality is that the more mature a platform is the unknown areas where you could potentially bring down the cost narrow and we’re facing that right now that “We’re not going to be able to reduce cost on a mature program as much as we potentially will need to” he said. “Unless we see substantial improvement or a pathway forward then you have to look at what we’re able to do – what we can afford – and is there a better platform to do it with.”

The F-35 program still has its staunch supporters in Congress and the Pentagon.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin supports the “critically important program” said chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby Monday while adding that the problems are being worked through. “The department remains committed to the F-35 going forward as do many of our allies and partners.”

His comments echoed those of Brigadier General David Abba director of the Air Force’s F-35 Integration Office. “The United States Air Force is absolutely committed to the F-35” Abba said at the House Armed Services Committee hearing two weeks ago though he acknowledged “difficult decisions” may be ahead if the sustainment costs aren’t reduced.

Meanwhile Rep. Don Bacon called the jet “the most significant and consequential military modernization for the United States our allies and freedom-loving nations around the world” adding that the F-35’s performance is “unmatched.” Rep. Blake Moore a fellow Republican said at the hearing “This plane can simply not be beat.”

Lord the former Pentagon chief of acquisitions said there is a balance between the program’s critics and its advocates. She cautioned “We need to be very thoughtful with what one prototype has demonstrated versus what one proven aircraft can do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvZGVwaW5rLm9yZy8wNTE2MjAyMV9ibGFja3JvY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock Shareholders Protest Planning Meeting - CODEPINK - Women for Peace,"Join CODEPINK as we plan our All Eyes on BlackRock Protest!

While CODEPINK has an ongoing campaign urging BlackRock to divest from all weapon manufacturers this year we also ask that BlackRock support human rights for this shareholder season.

WHEN: Sunday May 16th at 3PM EST

WHERE: Zoom

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager controlling more than $5 trillion in assets globally. BlackRock released a statement indicating that it would like companies to implement and disclose their human rights processes to identify manage and prevent adverse human rights impacts. But yet BlackRock is one of the largest shareholders of Tasers manufacturer Axon enterprise and has $7.25 billion invested in Boeing $3.3 billion in General Dynamics $5.6 billion in Lockheed Martin $3.4 billion in Northrop Grumman and $4 billion in Raytheon. Weapons made by these companies are being used in Palestine Syria Iraq Yemen and other places around the world where the US continues to be involved in active conflicts. As you can see even though BlackRock said it would like companies to implement human rights processes they continue to profit from war. BlackRock even has an iShares fund that exclusively benefits from weapons of war.

At this planning meeting for the upcoming May 25th protest of the BlackRock Shareholders meeting we’ll update everyone on some working plans including introducing our speakers and musicians as well as thinking through run-of-day logistics and roles for the day of the protest.

Inn knocked on 30-year-old Lance Lowe's door and stood off to the side police say. Lowe opened the door and then allegedly shot Officer Inn several times. Police say Lowe then exchanged gunfire with another officer who arrived before running back into his home.

Cellphone video showed the moment Lowe re-emerged from the home - holding his 8-year-old son by the neck.

A mystery hero then ran in and tackled Lowe freeing the boy. Lowe was then shot and killed by police.

On Wednesday the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation released some information about Lowe. Officials said Lowe had been given a five-year sentence in 2018 for a grand theft auto with the use of a firearm case out of Los Angeles County.

Lowe then received 820 pre-sentencing credits CDCR says and 37 post-sentencing credits while awaiting transfer.

In April 2020 CDCR says Lowe was released to parole supervision.

By Francisco Alvarado Floridabulldog.org

The path to Orlando Capote’s front door in Coral Gables is an impassable construction zone that no one can enter not even his neighborhood mail carrier.

On a recent afternoon cement trucks and excavators clogged the unpaved rocky terrain along the small stretch of Coconut Grove Drive where Capote’s two-bedroom home is located. A padlocked chain-link gate and fence separates the construction site and the sidewalk in front of the house forcing Capote to enter and exit his property through an alley behind his backyard.

For more than three years by order of the City of Coral Gables Coconut Grove Drive between Malaga and Palermo avenues has been completely closed to vehicular and pedestrian traffic so that a developer backed by Mexican investors could build the largest commercial development in the City Beautiful’s history.

Agave Holdings whose owners include members of the family behind Tequila brand Jose Cuervo is about a year away from finishing The Plaza Coral Gables a behemoth of a project that has literally swallowed whole Capote’s house.

His property is nearly engulfed by the high exterior walls of The Plaza’s two garages.

Lots of complaints lots of losses

The half-a-billion-dollar mixed-use development marched forward despite Capote’s 24 complaints to the city’s fire marshal and other officials since 2017. In 2018 he also appealed to the Miami-Dade Fire Safety Board that the closure of Coconut Grove Drive violated county and state law because fire rescue personnel do not have adequate access to his Coral Gables home in the event of an emergency. Each time Capote lost.

The street’s closing is just one of the ways Coral Gables officials appear to have run roughshod over Capote’s property rights and landed him in the belly of the beast.

Orlando Capote at home with his mother Lucia.

“As you can see it’s pretty miserable here” Capote told a Florida Bulldog reporter. “But they can’t get me out unless I stop paying property taxes.”

His fears were confirmed last Nov. 18 Capote said. His 94-year-old mother Lucia Capote had a bad fall and he was unable to pick her up. “I heard a huge blow and when I walked into the kitchen there she was lying on the floor.”

Even though every fire rescue unit in the Coral Gables Fire Department has keys to the gate in front of Capote’s house he had to tell the 911 operator that paramedics would need to come through the back alley because a backhoe was blocking the gate Capote said.

“When they got here they could not wheel the gurney into the house via the back door or the side door” he said. “So they sat her on her walker and wheeled her to the door where they then placed her on a stretcher. They had to carry her more than 200 feet to where the fire rescue truck was parked.”

Capote accuses

Capote accuses Coral Gables officials including Fire Marshal Troy Easley and Fire Chief Marcos de la Rosa of shutting down the only road with direct access to his front door even though it only benefitted a private development. “It used to be that fire codes to protect life safety and property were beyond any compromise” he said. “Of everything that has been done to us so far the city approving the closure of the only code compliant fire rescue access road to our property is at the top of the list.”

Attempts to interview Easley de la Rosa and Coral Gables City Manager Peter Iglesias were routed to Coral Gables spokeswoman Martha Pantin who said city officials were “not available” for comment. In fact they chose not to respond to Florida Bulldog.

In an April 20 response to a list of questions emailed to her on April 15 Pantin said Capote put himself in his current predicament by refusing to move out of the home he and his family have lived in for more than three decades.

“Unfortunately by choosing to remain in the property despite the development Mr. Capote should have understood what that would mean and the inconveniences that it could result in” Pantin said. “If Mr. Capote has concerns the city can review compliance with the staging plan.”

Purchased by Capote and his parents in 1989 for $130000 the barrel-tile roof house at 2915 Coconut Grove Drive is the last remaining single-family property on the block. By 2005 when Capote’s father died the surrounding homes across 7.2 acres were bought and razed to make way for Old Spanish Village a 900000-square-foot mostly residential community to be built by Ponce Circle Developers headed by Coral Gables developer Ralph Sanchez. (He died in 2013.)

In 2007 Sanchez broke ground on Old Spanish Village investing $128 million into the first phase which entailed two luxury towers and three-story villas with rooftop terraces. But the 2008 global economic recession stalled the project and it subsequently went into foreclosure.

Offers to sell Coral Gables home rejected

In 2011 Agave Holdings bought a large slice of Spanish Village for $30.6 million from FirstBank Puerto Rico which had seized it from Ponce Circle Developers in a $60.1 million foreclosure judgment. A year later Agave acquired a 7205-square-foot office building at 2901 Ponce de Leon Blvd. the only building on the Old Spanish Village site completed by Ponce Circle Developers. Agave tore down the building and other semi-built portions of the former development.

In 2015 the Coral Gables City Commission approved Agave’s initial concept called Mediterranean Village which entailed redeveloping 6.7 acres at 2801 2901 and 3001 Ponce de Leon Blvd. into a complex of 227 condominiums and townhouses 180 hotel rooms and nearly 600000 square feet of retail. Two years later city commissioners signed off on Agave’s latest iteration The Plaza Coral Gables which consists of two Class A office buildings an luxury apartment tower with 135 units a 242-room Loews Hotel 161000 square feet of retail commercial space and two garages. The buildings will be nearly 200 feet tall.

Between Ponce Circle Developers and Agave Holdings Capote said he’s received more than 40 offers to sell his Coral Gables home since the early 2000s and he’s turned them all down. “I had a woman come by who told me her grandmother built our house” Capote recalled. “She knew a lot of things about the house pointing them out to me. Afterwards I got an email from her about setting up a meeting to do a settlement with the city. That was just one of many instances of people coming by and throwing offers and alternatives. Some suggested setting up a meeting and the developer and the city to sign an agreement.”

In 2017 Agave Holdings built a three-bedroom house at 3002 Coconut Grove Drive on a parcel that was part of its 2011 acquisition of the Old Spanish Village site. The company offered to give him and his mother the new house in exchange for the title to their Coral Gables home but they declined the offer Capote said.

Agave Holdings’ managing directors Jose Antonio Perez Helguera and Carlos Beckmann did not respond to multiple Florida Bulldog phone messages requesting comment. But city spokeswoman Pantin acknowledged the developer attempted to negotiate with Capote.

“Mr. Capote was offered alternatives including the purchase of his property” Pantin said. “When he decided not to sell he was also offered the opportunity to relocate during the construction which he also declined.”

‘House of Lies’

The reason he said was not due to the fact that Agave shaved off roughly 2900 square feet from the entire lot at 3002 Coconut Grove Drive. The company is reserving that patch as an “open space.’’ It has no setbacks from the new house so he would be right up against a small public park Capote said.

“My mother called it the House of Lies because the offer was too good to be true” Capote said. “That was the last time I received a letter from the developer. I stopped counting the number of people who have tried to broker a deal with us. They all see an opportunity to make money.”

For the past six years Capote waged an unsuccessful campaign to stop Coral Gables officials from sidestepping city county and state laws governing property rights for the benefit of Agave Holdings. In 2015 he filed a complaint with the Miami-Dade inspector general about the city considering an application to vacate an alley from Capote’s garage to Galiano Street that Agave Holdings said was necessary to build its mixed-use project.

Capote alleged the city would be violating county and state law that mandates the closing of an alley must serve a public purpose. On March 23 2015 then-Miami-Dade Inspector General Mary Cagle wrote to then-Coral Gables Mayor Jim Cason that her office was referring Capote’s complaint to the city and that she would not be taking any further action.

“We do wish to remind you however that the Miami-Dade Traffic and Engineering Division has exclusive jurisdiction in respect to all matters of traffic engineering within the territorial areas of [the county]” Cagle wrote. “Accordingly this matter should be approved by the county prior to moving forward.”

City blows off county

On May 22 2015 Miami-Dade Public Works Deputy Director Antonio Cotarelo also put Coral Gables officials on notice by objecting to the vacating of the alley. “The county code clearly grants the county exclusive jurisdiction to determine the impact of a road closure or vacation” Cotarelo wrote to his Coral Gables counterpart Glenn Kephart. “The city therefore must seek and obtain the county’s approval prior to vacating any such city road alleyway or right-of-way.”

Former Coral Gables City Attorney Craig Leen

The next day then-Coral Gables City Attorney Craig Leen emailed two assistant county attorneys to notify them that the city did not need Miami-Dade’s blessing to close the alley: “The city does not recognize the right of the county to veto such a determination.” The alley was ordered closed in June 2015 when the Coral Gables city commission approved Agave’s mixed-use project.

Two years later Capote again found himself fighting with the city. This time he objected to the Coral Gables Fire Department signing off on closing the portion of Coconut Grove Drive where his house is located. On Dec. 1 2017 Agave Holdings put up the fencing and the gates to prevent vehicular traffic from going on the road. Twenty-six days later Capote sent an email to Fire Chief de la Rosa claiming that closing off Coconut Grove Drive to his Coral Gables home violated the county’s fire code because there was inadequate access to his house in the event of an emergency.

In a Jan. 10 2018 response de la Rosa informed Capote that the department’s fire prevention division chief and his staff had conducted a field visit to his house and determined that the accessibility and travel distance to his property are “within acceptable ranges.” Furthermore fire engines could access Capote’s home via the alley behind the backyard from either direction de la Rosa explained.

The fire chief also said the fire department consulted with Agave Holdings’ general contractor to improve access to the front of Capote’s Coral Gables home by installing lock boxes that contain keys to the gates and that all fire and police personnel would be able to open the lock boxes. “In summary we have devised a clear path to your property from both ends of the house” de la Rosa wrote.

Capote appeals

Five months later Capote appealed to the Miami-Dade Fire Prevention and Safety Appeals Board by arguing the alley was not a proper fire rescue road because it was partially unpaved and was not wide enough in certain segments to accommodate fire trucks.

During a May 31 2018 hearing Coral Gables Fire Marshal Easley testified that the alley was an acceptable access point even though he admitted he had not measured its width. He also said the gates blocking Coconut Grove Drive were not an obstruction other than a minor inconvenience. “An obstruction is something that we can’t navigate through without extreme effort” Easley said at the time. “A gate would be very minor to us.”

The board denied Capote’s appeal but mandated that all Coral Gables fire rescue vehicles had a master key for the lock boxes at each gate on Coconut Grove Drive and that gates not be obstructed.

“Fire rescue personnel still must open a minimum of two locked gates to reach the front of our home” Capote told Florida Bulldog. “In the event that a person in critical condition needs to be taken to a hospital then the fire rescue personnel would have to spend additional precious time opening locked gates at the either end of the closed road.”

Pantin said Agave Holdings will reopen Coconut Grove Drive once the company has completed construction which is currently slated for late 2022. “Coconut Grove Drive is a city street and will remain open to public use” she said. “Mr. Capote has access to [his] garage as an alternative access was included in the Plaza design. I went by the property and confirmed.”

Vow to remain in Coral Gables home

Capote’s mother Lucia never came home after paramedics took her away in November. “They initially took her to Coral Gables Hospital but was then transferred to another hospital around Nov. 20 where she had surgery” Capote said. “She was then transferred to a rehabilitation facility where she got an infection and had to go back to the hospital.”

She recovered and Capote placed her in the West Gables Rehabilitation Hospital. “She was doing better” Capote said. “She was no longer on oxygen and was eating her food.” But the optimistic diagnosis was short-lived. On Feb. 26 Lucia died Capote said.

Over the next three months Coconut Grove Drive remained an active construction zone until April 19. “When I got home I noticed that all the fences barriers etc. that were blocking the road were gone” Capote said. “It appears the work to reopen the road has started.”

Capote said he found the timing odd given Florida Bulldog had reached out to city officials about his claims. “The fire codes were violated for over three years yet little if anything happened” he said. “You contact the city and suddenly something is happening.”

The clearing of the road was short-lived. On May 10 Capote emailed Easley his most recent complaint about a cherry picker blocking the gate to his front yard. Easley responded by assuring Capote that fire trucks could get to the house and that “There are always individuals around to assist in moving the vehicles if necessary.”

Nevertheless Capote insists he is not giving up his house. “Not selling and not moving does not give the city the right to approve a development that violates numerous city and county codes as well as state law that exist to protect the safety and legal rights of a property owner” Capote said. “Maybe they thought ‘when this guy sees what we are going to do to him he will go away.’ Well I haven’t left and I don’t intend to leave.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RhbXBhLWJheS1yYXlzLW5ldy15b3JrLW1ldHMtYmFzZWJhbGwtbWxiLXNwb3J0cy03NjA3YjlmMDYwZGIwNDQ1ZmUwMTJmODViNGU2MjA1NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Margot Adames Lowe lead Rays over Mets 7-1 for sweep,"ST. PETERSBURG Fla. (AP) — Manuel Margot Willy Adames and Brandon Lowe homered off Marcus Stroman leading the Tampa Bay Rays over the New York Mets 7-1 on Sunday for a three-game sweep.

Two-run homers by Margot in the fourth and by Adames in the fifth built a 4-0 lead and Lowe led off the sixth with his seventh home run this season.

“It’s a good feeling to show some offense especially the way we’ve been going the last week or so” said Adames who is hitting .198. “When your team starts hitting like this it’s contagious. It’s good to know things are going in the right direction.”

Ji-Man Choi had three hits including an eighth-inning RBI double in his first game after recovering from arthroscopic right knee surgery.

Josh Fleming (3-3) allowed up one hit in five scoreless innings an infield single by Jeff McNeil leading off the game. Fleming left after 53 pitches and retiring his last nine batters.

“It was tough but I get it” he said. “I’m not going to sit there there and argue my point. That’s the way it works for us. If we can throw this well and give the ball to the bullpen I get it.”

Diego Castillo Ryan Thompson Collin McHugh and Cody Reed finished a two-hitter.

Patrick Mazeika who replaced McNeil homered off Diego Castillo in the sixth for his first major league hit in his sixth big league at-bat.

Stroman (3-4) dropped to 0-4 in his last five starts. He allowed five runs and six hits in six innings as his ERA rose from 2.01 to 2.72.

The three homers off Stroman matched the total he gave up in his first seven starts.

“I didn’t have it today” he said. “I threw a pitches that maybe flattened out a bit. I made a few mistakes and they made me pay for them.”

New York was swept after arriving with a seven-game winning streak.

Tampa Bay has won four in a row one shy of its season high.

“We’re having fun right now” said Fleming who got 11 swings-and-misses in his second scoreless start this season. “Everyone’s hitting and things are starting to come together.”

METS HAMSTRINGS

Mets right fielder Michael Conforto left in the middle of the first inning after grounding into a double play and McNeil came out for a pinch hitter in the third inning.

The Mets said Conforto had a tight right hamstring.

“Hamstring issues are no joke” Mets manager Luis Rojas said. “We’re going to get some tests MRIs. When you’re talking about hamstrings you get concerned. We are going to wait for the results and then figure out a timeline.”

McNeil has a tight left hamstring.

“It just grabbed on me a little bit” McNeil said. “Nothing bad but something we have to look at. Nothing too major just some tightness. There’s just something there.”

“This is a tough. I kind of a dealt with the same thing in 2019 when I went on the IL twice” he added.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Mets: RHP Jacob deGrom (right side tightness) hopes to throw a bullpen session Tuesday before the Mets determine when he can return to the rotation. ... OF Brandon Nimmo (left index finger bone bruise) will travel with the team to Atlanta but will not play until he can swing pain-free.

Rays: RHP Chris Archer who has not pitched since April 10 due to right forearm tightness has resumed throwing. No rehab plan is in place yet but manager Kevin Cash said Archer is likely to need rehab starts at Triple-A Durham.

UP NEXT

Mets: Taijuan Walker (3-1 2.20) will face the Braves’ Max Fried (1-1 6.55) in the opener of a three-game series in Atlanta on Monday night.

Rays: Luis Patino (1-1 1.54) will open Tuesday night’s game at Baltimore the opener of a six-game trip.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3VzLW5ld3MvdGVlbnMta2lja2VkLW91dC1vZi1sdXhlLWNhdGhvbGljLXNjaG9vbC1mb3ItYmxhY2tmYWNlLWF3YXJkZWQtMW0v0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvdXMtbmV3cy90ZWVucy1raWNrZWQtb3V0LW9mLWx1eGUtY2F0aG9saWMtc2Nob29sLWZvci1ibGFja2ZhY2UtYXdhcmRlZC0xbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teens kicked out of elite Catholic school for 'blackface' are awarded $1M by jury after proving it was just acne mask,"Two teens kicked out of their elite California Catholic school while falsely accused of wearing blackface have been jointly awarded more than $1 million after proving it was just a green acne face mask.

The then-students at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View were just 14 when they took a photo during a sleepover in 2017 of them wearing the treatment in solidarity with a friend suffering from severe acne their lawsuit said.

The treatment bought by one of the boys’ mom was light green when applied and turned dark green once dry.

Their “innocent” selfie then went viral three years later when it was found and widely shared during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

A Santa Clara County jury agreed this week that the school breached an oral contract and did not give them due process before expelling them in 2020 according to the Los Angeles Times.

The students identified only as A.H. and H.H. in the lawsuit were awarded $500000 each and will have their $70000 tuition reimbursed.

“This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them” said Krista Baughman one of the attorneys for the students.

“The jury rightly confirmed that Saint Francis High School’s procedures were unfair to our clients and that the school is not above the law.”

In a statement A.H.’s family said: “We want to sincerely thank the jury and the court system for helping our boys and our families find justice which now paves the way for their names to be cleared for things they never did.”

The lawsuit had initially sought $20 million. The jury rejected some of the boys’ claims including defamation and violation of free speech.

Representatives for the school said they “respectfully disagree” with the jury’s decision and are “exploring legal options” including an appeal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9lc3BuL2JldHRpbmcvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC80MDEwMjE2Ni9taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wYXJsYXktdGlja2V0LWJldHRvci1va2xhaG9tYS1jaXR5LXRodW5kZXItdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket of dreams? One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1vcGVuaW5nLW5ldy1oZWFsdGgtY2xpbmljLTEwLW1pbGxpb24tZG9uYXRpb24tODY0NTM1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Jordan Celebrates Opening of New N.C.

Michael Jordan celebrated the opening of a new health clinic in his hometown of Wilmington North Carolina and PEOPLE has an exclusive photo of the basketball legend at the event.

Jordan 61 and Novant Health teamed up to open a third clinic the Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic on Greenfield St. in Wilmington to bring ""much-needed comprehensive primary care services"" according to a release.

The clinic will include medical opportunities for ""individuals who are uninsured or underinsured"" a cause close to the former NBA star's heart.

""Everyone is worthy of access to quality health care no matter where you live or if you have insurance"" Jordan said in a release adding that he is ""truly inspired by the many powerful stories of people who are now thriving thanks to the support of our Charlotte medical clinics.""

Jordan whose $10 million donation to Novant Health allowed for two additional Jordan Family Medicals Clinics to be built in Charlotte added ""I am confident Novant Health's new clinic will positively impact individuals and families throughout Wilmington"" and said he's ""profoundly grateful to help make this day happen for my hometown.""



In PEOPLE's exclusive photo the former NBA star was seen speaking with Dr. Michael Hoben inside the lobby of the clinic during the opening.

According to the release many of the patients visiting Jordan's clinics have ""never had a primary care provider before"" and have ""praised the clinic teams for helping restore health and a sense of hope"" to families in North Carolina where Jordan currently resides.

In a statement Ernie Bovio president of the Novant Health Coastal Region and Novant Health New Hanover Regional Medical Center said “Each Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic has been thoughtfully planned for the best location within the community. Thanks to our care team’s commitment to lifelong wellness our third Michael Jordan clinic is already delivering on our vision to close health equity gaps by transforming healthcare one patient at a time.”

Senior vice president of Novant Health Ann Caulkins said “We are tremendously grateful to Michael Jordan for his philanthropic support of our efforts to close health equity gaps. The Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medicine Clinics in Charlotte provided more than 9000 patient visits last year and are delivering profound benefits in the community. We’re excited to expand this model in Wilmington where the clinic team will provide life-changing care.”

Jordan was born in Brooklyn New York but his family relocated to Wilmington when he was a toddler. Supporting his North Carolina hometown has always been a priority for the NBA great who owns a stake in Charlotte's NBA team the Hornets.

In August 2023 Jordan transitioned out of his majority stakeholder position to a minor ownership role after selling his stake to an ownership group led by Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin.

In a heartfelt message to Hornets fans at the time Jordan described the opportunity to own an NBA franchise in his home state as ""a dream come true.""



Jordan said he'll ""never forget the excitement"" in the city when the Hornets name returned to ""its rightful home in Charlotte"" in 2013 in his open letter to Charlotte. (The Hornets left Charlotte in 2002 and were replaced by the Bobcats. Under Jordan's leadership the team reclaimed the Hornets name in 2013 SI reported.)

Jordan looked back on the Hornets' return to Charlotte as a ""uniting"" moment for the city's Bobcats and Hornets fanbases. ""Our fans told us how important this was and the amazing level of support and enthusiasm proved their point"" he wrote.

On May 14 7-Eleven announced that it had completed its purchase of Speedway’s approximately 3800 stores in 36 states. The same day FTC Acting Chairwoman Slaughter and Commissioner Chopra issued a statement suggesting that 7-Eleven’s acquisition of Speedway LLC was “illegal” and that it raised “significant competitive concerns in hundreds of local retail gasoline and diesel fuel markets.”

“7-Eleven is disappointed by the statement as it fails to acknowledge the facts that led to 7-Eleven closing the transaction” the Irving Texas based company with more than 9500 U.S. c-stores said. “To be clear 7-Eleven was legally allowed to close on the Speedway transaction today and statements or implications to the contrary are false.”

“The parties closed the transaction after all conditions to close were fully satisfied” Marathon Petroleum said in a separate statement. Marathon Petroleum “is in receipt of the $21 billion sale proceeds and Speedway and its assets are owned by 7-Eleven.”

7-Eleven and the FTC entered into an agreement permitting 7-Eleven to close on May 14 the company said and it entered into a settlement agreement at the end of April that resolved competitive concerns by having 7-Eleven divest 293 fuel outlets.

“We were informed that the FTC staff including leaders in the Bureau of Competition recommended that the FTC commissioners approve that settlement” the company said. “7-Eleven has been operating under the terms of that settlement agreement since it was signed and continues to do so.”

On May 11 Slaughter and Chopra said they wanted more time to review the settlement agreement 7-Eleven said. “7-Eleven took the request very seriously but such a last-minute delay would have created enormous disruption to the lives of our new colleagues at Speedway and to the business. Given that there was no legal basis for such a delay and given that 7-Eleven was abiding by the negotiated settlement agreement we closed today on schedule.”

“The only concern that Acting Chairwoman Slaughter and Commissioner Chopra articulated to 7-Eleven about the negotiated settlement agreement was that it allowed too much time for the required divestitures to take place. Ironically 7-Eleven did not ask for that amount of time. It was proposed by FTC staff to assist the proposed buyers and 7-Eleven has offered several times to change to the originally anticipated shorter time frame” 7-Eleven said.

In its statement Findlay Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum said “Throughout its thorough evaluation of the transaction Marathon Petroleum and 7-Eleven worked very cooperatively over many months with the [FTC] … The relevant conditions to close the transaction were satisfied with the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the expiration of the parties' timing agreement with FTC staff which had been extended multiple times. That timing agreement elapsed overnight with the FTC electing to take no action on the transaction. Upon satisfaction of all conditions to close the parties finalized the transaction this morning.

“In the hours after the closing two sets of FTC commissioners elected to issue separate statements both stating publicly that the FTC had indeed taken no action on the transaction during the HSR Act waiting period. [Marathon Petroleum] supports 7-Eleven's position released earlier today that the companies were legally allowed to close the Speedway transaction today and statements or implications to the contrary are false.”

And in a statement separate from Slaughter and Chopra’s FTC Commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson said “Both companies duly notified the commission and the Department of Justice pursuant to the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. … To the extent that our colleagues insinuate that the parties have acted in bad faith in this process we have been given no information suggesting the parties failed to work constructively with staff to negotiate a timely and effective resolution.”

Japanese retailer Seven & i Holdings Co. said Saturday it has completed its $21 billion acquisition of Speedway LLC a U.S. convenience store chain and gas station network despite U.S. antitrust officials saying the deal may be ""illegal.""

The future of Seven & i's purchase of Speedway could be under scrutiny after the acting chairwoman and a commissioner of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in a statement Friday ""We have reason to believe that this transaction is illegal.""

They said the deal raises ""significant competitive concerns in hundreds of local retail gasoline and diesel fuel markets across the country.""

7-Eleven Inc. a U.S. subsidiary of Seven and i said in its press release the same day that completion of the purchase was ""legally allowed.""

Tokyo-based Seven & i said it has acquired the convenience store and fuel retail businesses of Marathon Petroleum Corp. the U.S. oil refiner that owns Speedway.

The U.S. subsidiary added that to address such competitive concerns it divested 293 fuel outlets and was informed that the FTC staff has recommended that the commissioners approve the deal.

In their statement Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the commission will ""continue to investigate to determine an appropriate path forward to address the anticompetitive harm.""

Seven & i announced in August last year its plan to buy Speedway which has about 3900 stores in the United States in a bid to expand revenue sources overseas due to a saturated domestic market.

Hotel guests tended to look elsewhere when it came time to plan family reunions getaways with friends and other group trips. Even die-hard members of Marriott Bonvoy the hotel's popular loyalty program would end up booking on sites like Vrbo which offered bigger places to stay with full kitchens private pools and other family-friendly comforts.

""We knew we could do it better"" recalls Jennifer Hsieh a vice president at Marriott. Over the next two years her team partnered with home-management companies around the world — ACME House Co. Natural Retreats and Paradise in Hawaii among others — to build a portfolio of 25000 homes in dozens of countries called Homes & Villas by Marriott International.

All come with pro-level cleaning and hotel-caliber amenities plus the benefit of allowing guests to earn and redeem points on stays. ""Members have redeemed billions of points since we launched"" Hsieh says on homes like the Palm Springs four-bedroom built for Frank Sinatra (one guest booked it for 2 million points) and a Modernist escape overlooking the slopes in Big Sky Montana (where a traveler dropped 4.8 million points on a multi-week stay).

Even so the hotel-affiliated vacation villa has sailed under the radar until recently when the pandemic made private homes even more desirable. Now the concept is catching on — as evidenced by Accor which unveiled its own Apartments & Villas last December with 50000 places to stay in hundreds of cities. The massive selection includes completely private home and villa rentals through OneFineStay a once-boutique rental firm that Accor acquired in 2016; on-property residences at hotels operated by Banyan Tree Delano Fairmont Raffles and SLS; and oversize suites at extended-stay brands Adagio and Mantra.

The hotel residences are particularly popular according to Jeff Tisdall a senior vice president at Accor. ""We have more than 30 branded private residences already and 80 additional projects under development"" he says.

The booming demand has even spurred non-hotel companies to get into villa rentals. Seattle-based TCS World Travel is best known for its private-jet journeys often run on behalf of clients such as Four Seasons. In October the firm debuted TCS Private Homes Plus which rents residences in the U.S. and Mexico. Each comes with prearranged itineraries of as many (or as few) experiences as guests want whether hot-air ballooning over the ruins of Mexico's Chichén Itzá or riding in a horse-drawn sleigh in Jackson Hole Wyoming.

Not that tried-and-true vacation-rental firms are standing still. Miami-based Oasis Collections which first went live in 2009 offers 1500 chic apartments in Europe South America and the U.S. The company's latest innovation is a subscription service: guests who sign on for a three- or six-month commitment (from $1550 per month) can hopscotch around the world switching homes every month with housekeeping utilities and concierge service included. Sure beats playing roulette on Airbnb.

Hilton Head Island is unique among American vacation destinations in that it has a wide appeal to multiple generations. Spend your days at one of the many wide pristine beaches ride bicycles around the island with the whole family and then indulge in cocktails and coastal cuisine at one of the about 250 restaurants the 12-mile island has to offer.

As the travel industry rebounds and we look (finally) to an end to the pandemic in the U.S. the island stands ready to welcome guests back thanks to plans enacted last summer designed to protect the health of the community workforce and visitors.

Whatever you like to do on vacation chances are Hilton Head has it -- let's take a look at how the island offers something for every kind of traveler.

It's easy to get to

Hilton Head Island is located on the southeast coast of South Carolina about 30 miles from Savannah Georgia and 45 minutes from the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV) which is served by most major U.S. carriers from multiple hubs around the country. The island has its own airport too which has seen a surge in service from major carriers throughout the last year.

Hilton Head's geography also makes it an appealing destination to drive to -- especially for those who live in the eastern half of the country. The drive can easily be done in a day from major East Coast cities like New York Philadelphia and Washington D.C. and much less of course if you're based in major cities in the Southeast like Atlanta or Charlotte.

Accommodations are plentiful

Once you set your sights on Hilton Head you have many options for accommodations ranging from home and villa rentals to luxury resorts. The island's beautiful shoreline is within reach at every touchpoint.

The Sea Pines Resort on the south end of the island is beside the idyllic Harbour Town Yacht Basin and bordered by the famous Harbour Town Golf Links and Harbour Town Lighthouse.

If you're traveling with the whole family consider a vacation home rental. Hilton Head Island's website offers special deals and packages on rentals.

If a full-service resort is more your speed Hilton Head Island offers more than 20 hotels inns and resorts. Those with Marriott Bonvoy points will be happy to learn that there are two full-service Marriott properties on the island: the Marriott Hilton Head Resort & Spa as well as the Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa.

The Marriott resort is a Category 5 property (30000 35000 or 40000 points per award night depending on the season) while the Westin is a Category 6 (40000 50000 or 60000 points per award night). Both of these properties are eligible -- on nights with off-peak or standard availability -- for the annual up to 35000-point and up to 50000-point award night certificates that come as a perk of the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card and Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card respectively.

For an even more luxurious stay look at the Montage Palmetto Bluff a member of the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program. This property is a short drive from Hilton Head Island and is on the May River.

The island is a paradise for golf and tennis

With 24 courses even the most advanced golfers will find a challenge on Hilton Head Island. To kick off summer each year the island welcomes the RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing tournament.

History is all around you

This island has a fascinating history. For more than 300 years the Gullah ancient culture continues to remain a vibrant thread in the fabric of Hilton Head Island life. Their influence on the area can still be seen today in the Gullah language (a creole similar to Sierra Leone Krio) African names their African folktales and craft items. Much of the Lowcountry's beloved food culture also originated with the Gullah — rice purlo okra gumbo shrimp and gravy cooked with spices and time-honored African cooking methods.

Historic Mitchelville located on Hilton Head's Port Royal Sound was America's first self-governed town of freed slaves. Established in 1862 by General Ormsby Mitchel the commander of the Union forces that occupied Hilton Head Island the town was built by and for those granted their freedom before the Emancipation Proclamation in the Port Royal Experiment. Gullah people direct descendants of Mitchelville continue to tell their story through the Mitchelville Freedom Park and the Mitchelville Preservation Project.

Co-Head Middle East Europe India & Americas at Shangri-La Group

The hotel It will open with four main restaurants including the award – winning Chinese restaurant Shang Palace an international buffet restaurant a Patisserie located in the lobby and a poolside bar and lounge area. An Arabic and Japanese restaurant and a cigar lounge are planned to open later in 2022.

How has the chain handled the effects of the pandemic in the region especially in the UAE?

The Covid-19 pandemic has required us to raise our already demanding hygiene standards with new protocols procedures and training. Throughout our hotels worldwide Shangri-La Group introduced the “Shangri-La Cares” commitment a global safety programme.

Shangri-La has followed recommendations laid out by the World Health Organization or more stringent local directives where appropriate to ensure our operational protocols are comprehensive. Concrete measures have been adopted at all hotels and resorts to combat the risk of COVID Covid -19 so that guests can feel safe when staying at or visiting its properties.

To reinforce the strong culture of health and safety we enhanced training learning and development resources for colleagues on essential preparatory and prevention measures.

Colleagues will also be equipped with personal protective equipment where necessary. Shangri-La will continue to build awareness on sanitation standards as well as developing program for colleagues on stringent personal hygiene practices to ensure a safe work environment.

These measures will be continuously updated based on the local requirements to ensure they meet evolving customer needs and expectations.

As people look to travel in the future health safety and sustainability will remain top of mind particularly as the world continues to react and respond to the COVID Covid -19 pandemic and a ‘new normal’. We will continue to convey our heartfelt care by creating a safe environment where our colleagues work with peace of mind and guests can confidently enjoy the moments that matter most.

Caring for people is the bedrock of Shangri-La’s service value and the health and safety of our colleagues and guests remains of utmost priority.

What are some of your latest F&B innovations?

Most industries across the globe are experiencing a surge of accelerated and new consumer trends and food and beverage is no exception. In addition we have faced a number of continuously changing local restrictions across our markets that have largely affected our food and beverage operations.

But as they say with change comes opportunity and the circumstances have also inspired us to relook at our approach to traditional hotel food and beverage. We’ve reimagined existing experiences found new replacement revenue streams and formed incredibly creative partnerships that differentiate our dining experiences. And naturally we have focused on online channels of communication.

The key factor throughout all this has been to remain close to our customers listen closely to their changing needs and act accordingly.

For example at the start of the pandemic our hotels received a number of requests from regular guests who missed dining out missed our restaurants and missed our cuisine. They were asking for delivery which is not something we had traditionally done in our hotels in the region. In response our teams have worked on putting together extensive menus catering to the domestic palate in order to bring our restaurant experiences to the comfort of people’s homes.

We also tapped onto the online shopping experience trend early on by extending our online retail options to include food and beverage creations. In Shangri-La Hotel Qaryat Al Beri Abu Dhabi for example guests can purchase anything from Ramadan luxury hampers to a to Girls Day Out and more!

For unique relevant and differentiated activations our partnerships have added stand-out offerings to their local markets. We introduced a number of industry-first private dining experiences with Veuve Clicquot for example. In the Shangri-La Toronto our Clicquot in the Snow introduced guests to a private dining experience in a redesigned bedroom themed around a winter ski chalet and including an après ski fine dining menu paired with Veuve champagnes.

For a fascinating evening in Shangri-La Bosphorus Istanbul guests are whisked away to a Suite redesigned with notable stylish décor reminiscent of years past. The suite is decorated with colourful folding screens that line the spacious room while chic mirrors vintage frames with iconic sceneries and inspiring books in travel fashion and style set the sophisticated scene. Guests can relax in pink posh and art deco-style winged chairs while enjoying popular jazz records on the antique gramophone.

The experience continues on the suite’s terrace where a choice of Retro East and Retro West themed menus accompanied with Veuve Clicquot champagne pairings are served as take in spectacular Bosphorus views.

And let’s not forget our partnership at the Shangri-La Dubai with luxury event planner ByTuleen creating whimsical themed events accompanied by the glittering Dubai skyline. Enhanced with direct reach-out-and-touch views of the iconic Burj Khalifa the new unforgettable private experiences are available in two themes – Fly Me to the Moon and the more carefree and relaxed Bohemian Chic – and feature bespoke dining menus prepared by the hotel’s talented culinary team.

We’ve been in a continuous cycle of listening testing learning and optimising so watch this space for more…especially as we embark on our brand’s 50th anniversary journey this year!"

Visa and Mastercard both take security and fraud protection seriously. For that reason their Signature and World Elite cards carry fraud protection emergency card replacement and other features that may go above and beyond cards outside of these programs. Let's compare their offerings:

Visa Signature

Traditional Visa cards offer many protections including:

Zero liability for fraudulent charges

Emergency card replacement (within 24 to 72 hours)

Emergency cash disbursement (within two hours)

Lost or stolen card reporting

Some of the cards (but not all) in the Visa Signature line also provide. These benefits are ultimately up to the issuer:

The World Elite program goes beyond standard Mastercard benefits to offer cell phone protection. It's getting harder to find cards that provide cell phone protection but select Visa Signature cards and all World Elite Mastercards reimburse you for damage or theft to your mobile phone if you pay the monthly bill with the credit card. Some other Mastercard offerings also provide this coveted benefit.

Winner: World Elite Mastercards come slightly ahead thanks to the cell phone protection plan on all cards. However it's important to look at the benefits of the specific Visa Signature card you are considering because some offer more than others.

Travel protections

For frequent travelers both programs shine with the following travel perks:

World Elite

Mastercard recently removed many of the travel protections that consumers previously relied on including travel insurance. It advertises nothing of note that would make the World Elite program stand out in travel coverage.

Winner: Visa Signature travel protections are unmatched. If you're looking to protect your travel arrangements in the uncertainty of a post-pandemic era the Visa Signature card will be your better investment since Mastercard comes with little (if any) coverages.

Travel benefits

Bottom line

When it comes to Visa Signature and World Elite Mastercard there is no clear front-runner for which card is better to have in your wallet. Visa offers more protections but Mastercard outshines Visa in other areas especially if you are looking to celebrate getting out of the house with a one-of-a-kind experience in the summer or fall.

You can find excellent credit cards under both programs so it might be best to have at least one card that belongs to each program. Before you apply understand each card's specific benefits package especially when it comes to Visa Signature cards since the offerings vary. Always check with the issuer for a card's exact benefits package.

Only about 13% to 16% of Belgians prefer to use cash to pay for purchases while 7 out of 10 are familiar with contact-free payments according to this year’s Barometer of Digital Payments published on Saturday.

The annual survey conducted by Bancontact Payconiq Company Febelfin Mastercard Visa and Worldline in collaboration with the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB – Free University of Brussels) focuses on the payment habits and preferences of Belgians.

It shows that no-contact payments have increased in popularity among Belgians of all ages thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. While in 2019 only one-third of respondents said they were familiar with such payments the rate went to 47% last year then jumped to 70% this year.

Foremost among the converted are senior citizens aged 65-74 years 76% of whom have used a no-contact payment method at least once in 2021 up from 36% a year ago.

“Among those who paid at least once without contact the highest age groups prove to be more familiar with this system than youths aged 16 to 24 years” the Federation of Financial Institutions (Febelfin) commented.

No-contact cards are the preferred mode of payment for 36% of respondents compared to 16% a year ago while 37% still prefer to insert their cards into a machine down from 60% in 2020.

Using a smartphone to pay for in-store purchases is also becoming more popular. Some 35% of respondents said they had used their phones at least once for such payments as against 30% last year. Smartphone payment is most popular among young Belgians in the 16-24 age group 25% of whom listed it as their preferred mode of payment.

Overall 4 out of every 10 Belgians said they were comfortable with paying by smartphone while one-third of those who had not yet used theirs to do in-store shopping said they planned to do so in future.

Cash would appear to be on its way out. Only 13% to 16% of respondents still prefer to make cash payments with the drop in the popularity of liquid cash most pronounced in the youngest and oldest age groups.

Just 9% of 65-to-74-year-olds prefer paying by cash. According to Febelfin this could be a result of the health crisis since as senior citizens are more vulnerable to the coronavirus “they have manifestly begun to avoid liquid cash.”

6% of respondents said they never had liquid cash on them while 42% never carry more than €20 around. The average Belgian wallet contained €55.60 in cash in 2021 as against €61.20 before the pandemic.

Generally cash payments dropped by 39% in one year according to the study which was conducted among 1181 Belgians in March 2020 and 1176 in March 2021.

Mastercard Superyacht Regatta - Day 1 February 24 2021 © Jeff Brown Mastercard Superyacht Regatta - Day 1 February 24 2021 © Jeff Brown

by Sail-World/NZ Marine 16 May 2021 19:42 PDT

With a trans-Tasman travel bubble now in place and working between the Australian states and New Zealand NZ Marine Industry Association has clarified the changed entry situation between the two countries for cruising yachts and superyachts.

The new position lies within existing regulations and reflects the more relaxed and changing entry situation for tourists and temporary visitors entering Australia and New Zealand.

“We have been waiting over a year now and are very excited that yachts and their owners plus friends and families leaving from Australia can enjoy sailing in New Zealand” said NZ marine's CEO Peter Busfield.

The revised situation has been clarified in a statement issued by NZ Marine.

The statement says that ""with the newly implemented air travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand combined with an existing sea border exemption for vessels means New Zealand is now open to business for cruising yachts and superyachts coming from Australia.

""The yachts can visit New Zealand under the sea border exemption and yacht owners their families and friends can then join the yacht in New Zealand via the air border.

""With the two destinations and the wider South Pacific amongst the safest places to visit glob-ally the establishment of this new bubble provides a wealth of opportunities for those eager to get back out on the water and exploring.""

The situation currently prevailing is that a single state (and one set of regulations) exists within New Zealand but in Australia there are both state and federal regulations - but usually the state regulations prevail.

The statement makes it clear that $50000 of refit work must still be undertaken in New Zealand - but this can include berthage and other similar services Busfield told Sail-World.

As with the situation that existed for the America's Cup and its associated regattas only professional delivery crew are allowed to travel to New Zealand aboard the vessel. Owners friends and family are still subject to current and changing regulations for airtravel into New Zealand and re-entry back into their countries of domicile.

Potentially there is wriggle room for differences in requirements between the Australian states and the New Zealand entry requirements for those coming into New Zealand via an Australian state.

There is no official advice on the situation with incoming visitors who are fully immunised with the requirement currently being that they have to undertake a 14day quarantine period - if allowed in at all with current restrictions.

Busfield says the situation now is a lot easier for Australian superyachts owned by Australian residents who wish to compete in the regattas planned for New Zealand next summer and have their boats delivered to NZ by a delivery crew provide the NZD50000 spend requirement is met and is backed up by acceptabel documentation before

The situation in Europe is that more extensive restrictions apply between vessels transiting between countries than between Australia and New Zealand and some of the Pacific Islands which are also opening up for air travel and have entry requirements which are applicable to cruising vessels and superyachts.

The full statement issued by NZ Marine reads:

Trans-Tasman travel bubble

Cruising craft and superyachts departing Australia can gain entry to New Zealand under an exemption for vessels with NZ$50000 in service or refit bookings.

With the implementation of a new air border agreement owners’ family and friends who either have an Australian passport or have been allowed into Australia (and have spent an addition-al 14 days in Australia after isolation) can fly to New Zealand through the Australian/New Zealand trans-Tasman bubble and join their vessel.

“We have been waiting over a year now and are very excited that yachts and their owners leaving from Australia can come to New Zealand. It presents the opportunity for cruising and superyachts to enjoy New Zealand’s cruising grounds and superyacht regattas; the New Zealand Millennium Cup and the various regattas planned for 2022 by the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron” says CEO of the NZ Marine Industry Association Peter Busfield.

“Combining this with superyachts now being able to charter in both New Zealand and Austral-ia we see Australians and Kiwis able to get their overseas experience in style by chartering a superyacht in either country for a holiday of a lifetime.”

New Zealand is cruising yacht and superyacht-friendly; it has straightforward entry rules plentiful berths for visiting yachts and marine service centres nationwide. Internationally-recognised for its boatbuilding spar and sailmaking and engineering services many visiting yachts have undertaken major refits in New Zealand.

With Emirates Team New Zealand’s successful defence of the 36th America’s Cup the up-coming SailGP series the New Zealand Millennium Cup superyacht regatta running from 14 to 17th Feb and the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron’s regattas taking place in January and February 2022 New Zealand is a global focal point as a destination for superyachts. In addition a world-first superyacht fishing competition will take place from 11th to 13th February 2022 in Northland’s Bay of Islands immediately prior to the 2022 NZ Millennium Cup; the long-est running superyacht regatta in the Southern Hemisphere.

Key points for superyacht visitors

Destination New Zealand



• 24-months temporary entry of vessels A cruising yacht is entitled to visit New Zealand for up to 24 months without the need for the yacht to be imported to New Zealand. A Temporary Import Entry (TIE) certificate will need to be applied for from New Zealand Customs prior to arrival.



• Superyacht charter allowed Visiting superyachts complying with Maritime NZ requirements are welcome to charter in New Zealand.This is best arranged through a local superyacht agent who will process the necessary paperwork with Government departments.



• Visiting vessels exempt Goods & Services Tax (GST) of 15% A visiting yacht (entered on a ‘Temporary Import Entry’) may purchase goods (equip-ment) and services ‘zero rated’ of GST if the goods or services are to form part of the yacht and exported with the yacht. This also includes berthage costs repairs or refit work completed while in New Zealand. The process is simple with the GST not charged at point of purchase on production of the TIE certificate.



• Operational logistics for crew Crew are not required to pay tax providing they are not present in New Zealand for more than 365 days in any two-year period and are not employed by a New Zealand resi-dent/New Zealand-controlled company.



• NZ Cruising Guide NZ Marine has published a comprehensive information guide and directory for visiting superyachts and smaller cruising craft unlike anything else available in the world. Click here to download a copy.

Source: GNA

The operations of Susu collectors in Ghana are increasingly becoming digitised following a partnership between the Ghana Co-operative Susu Collectors Association (GCSCA) and Savings at the Frontier.



Operators of the financial scheme say with proper data build up and management they can now easily access the information of clients for speedy service and transparency.



Savings at the Frontier (SatF) is a joint programme by Mastercard Foundation and Oxford Policy Management (OPM)Limited aimed at improving the financial inclusion of low-income individuals and communities in Sub-Saharan Africa.



The partnership thus aims at equipping the GCSCA - the apex body of susu operators and unions - with the technical infrastructure required to digitise reporting and operations.



It is also ensuring that the necessary capacity is in place within the Association to manage the processes.



It would also create a framework to link up digital platform providers with Susu operators; organise stakeholder events involving practitioners software developers and local and regional coordinators to promote GCSCA's digitisation agenda and create networking opportunities.



An official statement issued to the Ghana News Agency on Tuesday said this would complement the initial efforts by the German Development Cooperation (GiZ) to help the GCSCA transition from manual to digital record keeping.



It thus supported financial institutions and software developers to build and deploy technologies that enabled GCSCA members to digitise their business operations.



Mr. Edmund Benjamin-Addy General Manager of GCSCA said the digitisation agenda of the Association had resulted in a great transformation within the financial sub-sector according to the statement.



""This has set the tone to make our work relevant to contribute to the digital space to support the national agenda"" it quoted him as saying.



He commended OPM and MasterCard Foundation for their support in ensuring that the Association achieved its digitisation agenda.



""As a result of this partnership Susu operators' bio data and other documentation are now stored and archived in solar-powered secure servers while Susu collectors on the ground are beginning to use Information Communication Technology (ICTs) to record their daily transactions representing a clear step towards creating transparency and improving the customers' trust in the sector"" it said.



It has also increased the capacity of GCSCA to enforce compliance by susu operators as well as quickened the reporting processes between the GCSCA National Secretariat and Regional Offices.



Mr. Ralph Menz proprietor of Naa Sika Susu Enterprise said ""With a good management system all clients' data is accessible anytime; while the reconciliation of a customer's account is instant thereby avoiding trust issues.""



He added that digitisation had helped them to build a history for their customers who could use that data to access credit from partner financial services.



""It has allowed Naa Sika and other susu operators to aid in financial inclusion for the marginalized an enabler in the Sustainable Development Goals"" he said.



Constantin Albot Fund Manager for Savings at the Frontier welcomed GCSCA's commitment to the agenda of digitisation and transparency saying that: ""We were happy to contribute to some of the early steps in this journey.""



""We know that more work needs to be done but we are optimistic that the Association will build on these early steps and achieve the qualitative transformation that Susu operators and customers need and expect.""



Barakissa Tien-Wahser GiZ Development Advisor for her part explained that ""Digitalisation starts with IT infrastructure and this is what GCSCA needs to continue in their digitalisation journey.""



She however appealed for more support to enable the GCSCA to realise its digitisation agenda.



""The project came at the right moment with the right support for GCSCA to help them to achieve a large part of their objectives"" she said.



Edmund Benjamin-Addy the General Manager of GCSCA also said the digitisation agenda had resulted in a significant transformation in the financial sub-sector.



""This has set the tone to make our work relevant to contribute to the digital space to support the national agenda and we are so grateful to MasterCard Foundation and OPM"" he said.



GCSCA was established in 1994 as an umbrella organisation for all regional Susu collectors' societies in Ghana.



The Association has affiliated societies in all the regions of Ghana and has its national headquarters in Accra.



GCSCA was established to self-regulate the activities of Susu collectors and instill best practices which would build customer confidence in their operations.



Savings at the Frontier (SatF) is a six-and-a-half-year programme (2015-2022) that seeks to bridge the gap between the supply of formal financial services and informal savings mechanisms (ISMs) in Ghana Tanzania and Zambia.



It is to ensure that ISM users in these countries have a greater choice and use of financial services that best meet their needs.



SatF is a $17.6 million partnership between OPM and the Mastercard Foundation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZsaWdodGNsdWIuaXQvZW4vMjAyMS8wNS9uZW9zLWFpci1taWxhbi1uZXcteW9yay0yL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZsaWdodGNsdWIuaXQvZW4vMjAyMS8wNS9uZW9zLWFpci1taWxhbi1uZXcteW9yay0yL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,E’ UFFICIALE.

In the past few months we have talked more and more about Neos Air the airline owned by tour operator Alpitour and today comes confirmation of the most delicious news: the Milan Malpensa - New York JFK connection takes off on June 27.

In this article:

Italy opened to non-essential travel for US tourists who will be able to fly to our country without quarantine but with the protocol of covid-tested flights. The company already operates in this field with its connections with China and also applies the IATA travel pass protocol.

The route opened by Neos is very busy. The connection to New York is operational with the American ""three sisters"" (Delta United and American Airlines) and with Emirates. Barring any surprises it will not be operated by Alitalia which currently flies to New York only from Fiumicino.

The flight is currently scheduled twice a week: Thursday and Sunday. Departure from Milan is scheduled for 12:20 p.m. arriving in New York at 2:50 p.m. Departure from the American airport is scheduled at 5:50 p.m.

The fleet

Neos has a total of six Boeing 787-9s: four are new mentre two were flying for Norwegian .

The 787s are configured with economy and premium economy seats for a total of 359 seats.

The rates

Prices start at €269.99 one way for an economy promo fare ticket and go up to €924.99 for a premium freedom fare ticket.

The fares are not very aggressive we have seen in recent months offers to fly to business class also for less than 1000 in which case Neos offers a round-trip ticket in economy for €540. While to fly premium with a semi-flexible ticket the demand is nearly 1000 euros.

In conclusion

The choice of Neos is certainly interesting for the first time it will enter into direct competition with traditional airlines by moving away from the tourist routes it usually operates to feeder passengers to Alpitour facilities around the world and various charters.

The fleet is absolutely up to the task the Dreamliners are among the most modern and efficient aircraft starting from scratch right now is a gamble that can also be won especially if Alitalia is not added to the list."

Zach Lingenfelter of Indian River won medalist honors with a five-over par performance on the par 35 front nine. Cape’s Ethan Mercer and Quinn McCullough tied for best score among the visitors with a pair of 44s. Tom Burn shot a 49 for third best for Cape. Seth Reynolds and Dylan Steinwedel tied for the Vikings’ final scoring spot with their 54s.

On May 6 the Cape team traveled to Heritage Shores Golf Club in Bridgeville to face the Sussex Tech Ravens. The Vikings won 195-209 despite hitting several shots into the ponds.

Caleb Wilson of Sussex Tech won medalist honors with his 43. McCullough scored a 46 to lead Cape’s contingent.

Steinwedel’s 48 continued the improved play he showed with his 45 against Sussex Academy the day before. Burn made a 50 and Mercer finished the team scoring with his 51.

Mercer said he hit one ball into the water but most of his other troubles came on putting greens.

Head coach Rob Harrod said Steinwedel was the “only one that played with the same ball all day.” Other golfers suffered multiple shots into the water on the same holes he said.

Many golfing readers of this column can sympathize having been there and done that.

The Vikings must now wait for their next move. Saturday May 15 is the last day for scholastic golf matches to be completed. A total of 96 golfers will be selected for the state tournament using the modified handicap system adopted for this season by the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association in cooperation with the Delaware State Golf Association.

Allen is retiring from his position as a physical education teacher at Lightfoot Elementary School at the end of this school year. He also has served as the coach of the girls tennis team at Orange County High School and a football coach. On May 5 a group of his former players and students gathered behind the Hornet Sports Center at the high school to throw an unofficial retirement party for Allen.

A spread of cake cookies and other treats were laid out on tables in the shade and some of the old scorebooks from Allen’s previous seasons were stacked close by. Balloons were tied to weighted objects the only thing keeping the napkins from blowing away in the breeze. The girls tennis team was preparing for its match against Fluvanna but Allen found time to greet each individual who had come to celebrate him. He stopped to reminisce about how his journey began.

“I remember Mr. Graham (former assistant superintendent) had a list in front of him” Allen said. “He asked if I could coach football and I said I could be an assistant. So I ended up as ninth grade assistant football coach my first year. Then he said ‘do you know anything about basketball?’ I told him I had played basketball. He said ‘we need a junior varsity coach.’ I said ‘I can do that.’ He threw out wrestling and I said ‘I know nothing about wrestling sir.’ Finally he said we have a tennis opening and I said ‘I played tennis in high school and at Radford.’ He replied that the opening was for the girls tennis coach which surprised me but I said yes anyway.

“After that he told me to go see Mr. Higgins at Lightfoot Elementary School and that I could have the physical education job there” he continued. “Basically before he ever hired me as a teacher he had to check three coaching slots off his list.”

In addition to working at Lightfoot for his entire career Allen has taught at other elementary schools in the county. Everywhere he’s gone he’s made new friends and imparted his personal brand of wisdom.

“School administration has sent me to every elementary school for about one or two days a week to teach gym classes” Allen explained. “Those include Gordon-Barbour Locust Grove and Orange Elementary. Because of all that traveling around I’ve met a lot of students in the county over the years.”

“I’ve enjoyed teaching both the elementary and high school kids” he continued. “I coached football at the high school for 32 years and then became the head football coach and now assistant coach over at Prospect Heights Middle School for the last seven years.”

Allen said that despite running into former students and players of his at school events and throughout the county he was still surprised and flattered to have them show up to one of his last matches.

“I’ve coached so many players from different sports during my career that some of the names have kind of slipped away” he said. “But I certainly love when people come up and catch up with me. They’ll either tell me their first or last name and it usually rings a bell and then I remember it from there. I’m at the point now where I have kids tell me that I taught their grandma and I’m like ‘don’t say that too loud.’”

Molly Gudka one of Allen’s star tennis players that he coached from 2011 to 2016 is close friends with Michaela Allen his daughter. Gudka who attended the May 5 retirement party said that having Allen as a coach was a unique experience since she had always known him as a family friend.

“He was my P.E. teacher growing up and of course Michaela is my best friend” Gudka said. “So I saw him when I would come over to their house and he would also come to my family’s Fourth of July parties. Having him as a coach was seriously a dream come true. Just because he’s like the most fun coach I know. He likes to do silly things like juggle dance and crack jokes. He was always entertaining.”

Before her first practice Gudka was nervous that her classmates might think that Allen was picking favorites with her joining the team. It turned out that was far from the case and Gudka had to work hard to prove herself and earn a high ranking among her fellow players. Nevertheless she said that Allen was the kind of coach that had your back if you were struggling.

“He’s not one of those intense coaches” she said. “Because you sometimes see that where they yell at players. Like if we flop or keep making the same mistake he’ll tell us ‘look you’ve got to do better.’ Overall he was pretty laidback and easygoing. That made him really approachable and I always felt comfortable around him. I can’t say the same thing about a lot of other coaches.”

“It was kind of mind blowing to see all of those score books laid out today and those are just from the 80s and 90s I believe” she continued. “The fact that he saved them all shows he’s a good coach. He cares. It’s kind of sad to see him retire. I know he’s moving on to bigger and better things though.”

Leigh Ann Isenhower another of Allen’s former players was setting up some lawn chairs near the courts to watch the Fluvanna match. She echoed Gudka’s sentiments.

“I think he taught us to depend on each other a lot which people who like to play singles matches don’t really care to do” she said. “You always had that voice of Coach Allen in your ear which is a very pronounced voice.”

Isenhower was on the team in the mid-2000s and works as a nurse practitioner in Culpeper. Since moving back to Virginia from Alaska she has been able to stop by and catch a few of the girls tennis matches which she said she’s enjoyed.

The girls tennis team has a new addition this season with high school volleyball coach Austin Horner joining as an assistant. Horner is an alumnus of OCHS and played tennis growing up.

“I knew he was retiring from teaching” Horner said. “I didn’t know he was going to keep doing tennis. But I told him ‘you know I’m coaching volleyball and I’m already approved in the system.’ So Coach Allen knows that my brothers and I we all played tennis. My family are big tennis people. I offered to help his team out as much as he needed.”

Horner was briefly on the tennis team at his alma mater Bridgewater College but chose to quit in order to pursue other activities. He was also the head tennis coach at Spotswood High School in Rockingham County for two years before moving back to his hometown.

“Jay’s been doing it for 40 years so he definitely has his way of doing things” he said about coaching alongside Allen. “I wasn’t going to come in and try to tell him what to do. I just wanted to provide as much support as possible. I think he’s good about if he wants something done he trusts me enough to take care of it.”

Michaela Allen’s daughter and youngest of his three children with his wife Jody said that she can’t remember a time when she wasn’t coming to matches to watch her dad in action. She eventually joined the team around the same time as Gudka.

“I was happy and proud to be his daughter and on the team” she said. “It worked out. He’s taught me to work hard all my life. Things flowed easily from his lessons as a dad to his lessons as a coach.”

For his part Allen is satisfied with his career leading the girls tennis team despite not winning a state championship.

“The 1988-89 tennis team was my only team that won the district and will always have a special place because of that accomplishment” he said. “Back in the day James Monroe and Culpeper and some of the other high schools in our district had major advantages over us. When we moved to the Jefferson District Albemarle and Western Albemarle had the Boar’s Head girls on their teams. It’s just hard to compete on that level when there’s all of six tennis courts in Orange County.”

“If mom and dad didn’t play tennis then I had to start at the beginning with players” he continued. “But I’ve been successful. I’ve won more than I’ve lost. I’m finishing with 252 wins and a little over 200 losses. We’ve always been competitive. I’ve tried to get across to them that at the end of the day tennis is team sport. If they take care of their part individually then the team will win.”

Now that he is moving into a different chapter of his life Allen is ready to relax with his wife and celebrate his accomplishments.

“We are going to stay in Orange” he said. “My wife is retired too. She taught 35 years of special education. Our retirement plan is we bought a camper. It’s about 33 feet long and is stored at Myrtle Beach right now. So we’re going to go to Myrtle Beach about six or seven times a year and enjoy the life down there.”

But just because Allen is taking a breather doesn’t mean he’s resting on his laurels. Staying busy is a priority.

“My plan for next year is I hope [OCPS] will allow me to drive the bus for the sports teams that have to leave school early” he said. “I have my CDL (commercial driver’s license) from driving my own teams. That way I can drive Prospect Height’s football team to their games stay and watch and then take them back. I would like to kind of stay in the loop.”

“I just want to say I’ve been very proud of the girls I’ve coached” he added. “Most of them have gone to college and been very successful in the years after tennis team. It’s good to be a part of that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsaW5nL2Jlc3QtaW50ZXJnZW5kZXItbWF0Y2hlcy1vdXRzaWRlLXd3ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Great Intergender Matches Outside Of WWE You Didn't Know About,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsaW5nL2Jlc3QtaW50ZXJnZW5kZXItbWF0Y2hlcy1vdXRzaWRlLXd3ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvaW5ld3MtbGlmZXN0eWxlL3NpbmdsZS1saWZlLWJlbmVmaXRzLWxvY2tkb3duLWRhdGluZy1hcHBzLXN1bW1lci1sb2NrZG93bi0xMDAxMjUz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The overlooked benefits of being single for 20 years in world that revolves around couples,"After a year of isolation for so many the news that hugs and “cautious cuddling” (we all know what that means) is allowed from Monday 17 May has meant the internet is awash with jokes and memes about a summer of love. We will finally be legally allowed to date and get as close as we like to each other.

Match Group owner of dating apps including Tinder and Hinge has had a surge in demand as lockdown restrictions have eased. It is also betting on a big bang of summer loving. But what about those of us who don’t want to couple up or haven’t met anyone worth sharing a duvet let alone a life with?

I’ve been an unmarried single woman for two decades now. I’m not just a member of that club I’m a senior one – the kind who’s running the bar and doing a reluctant stint as secretary too. I shouldn’t need to be told it’s okay to be single. Feminism already won that battle. But maybe it’s hard to embrace single life when you’ve always got one eye on the future hope or current absence of a partner in your life. Or maybe it’s not hard but we think it should be. Maybe it’s all of these things.

So what does happy ever after look like if your prince never shows up? This is a question I have never really asked myself before. For me single life was supposed to be a glorious rumspringa a chance to ride every rollercoaster in the park before the Big Settle Down. A limbo life but a happy one – a holding pattern filled with infinitely entertaining distractions.

The pandemic robbed us of those distractions of course which makes the present rush to find post-lockdown love completely understandable. But if I were going to sell singleness trying to pitch it as the dream ending to my story I’d focus on the aspirational stuff. You’ll probably age better I’d say. You’ll wrinkle slower. Think of all those hours of sleep you’ve already got on the rest of humanity all the nights no partner or child has kicked or shaken you awake. Think of all those eight-hour stretches of luxurious slumber still to come and the unending rota of other people’s hassles that you won’t wake up to.

Your holidays will be better. You know they will. No compromise destinations no make-the-best-of-it camping no hours of enforced boredom sitting in the freezing café of a soft-play centre.

You’ll meet lots of people and have the opportunity to get to know them to make as many friends as you want. You won’t be hamstrung by your partner’s reluctance to go out or the complex tapestry of the kids’ extracurricular activities. You won’t have to make do with the slightly unsettling couple you met at the school gates or the people you already see way too much of at work.

You’ll never have to feel guilty about fancying someone. (There may be a few caveats to this.) You’ll have more disposable income. Well you would anyway if you got a real job. All of these benefits have at some time or other made me happy to be single. I do worry though that there’s something disingenuous about them. They sound like compensation not the thing itself. They don’t add up to a life.

The problem with making the case for single living is that we have to define it by the thing it isn’t. And it’s always single people who lose out in that comparison not the other way round. It’s easy to list the experiences we lack but partnering up and parenting involve relinquishment too. I remember – when I was younger and coupled life seemed so much more sophisticated than my own – envying other people’s weekends. Those indolent lie-ins in suggestively rumpled sheets breakfast on a tray choosing something fun to do with the rest of the day. It took me far too long to realise that couples didn’t have a patent on lazy Sundays. And now my friends with children have to barter with each other for the right to stay in bed.

Being with someone else demands sacrifice – not just of your time or your resources or your long-held dreams but of parts of yourself parts that you’ll never notice never become. And the joy of being single isn’t in filling your life with compensatory excitements or gloating over your independence. It’s in being the truest and most complete version of yourself that will ever exist.

I can’t deny that I’d like a little reassurance on the journey. I’m human; I need security stability a sense of home. The things that the prince and the palace and the brood of princelets are supposed to deliver.

Sometimes it’s hard to see where that’s coming from although more often it’s hard to appreciate where it already exists. It’s difficult to create a language for it when all the vocabulary for grown-up contentment belongs to coupledom. How do you “make a home” on your own? Or “build a life” without kids? Can you “settle down” when the people closest to you keep making decisions without you and moving away?

It can sometimes feel like I’m trying to make a garden out of Lego but the pieces I’ve got are for an industrial military base and half of them are missing. There are no instructions and the picture on the lid of the box shows nothing but a miserable-looking gardener holding a cat. There’s an asterisk next to the cat. The accompanying text says: “Cat not included.” I didn’t choose singleness not in the way that other people choose to live with each other or to marry or even to divorce. But I have chosen independence a life without compromise a future of my own making. And a summer that solo I know I’ll love.

‘Self-Contained: Scenes from a Single Life’ by Emma John (£12.99 Cassell) is out now",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc2VyaWVzL2NvdW50eS1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMjAyMS0xMjQ0MTg2L2dsYW1vcmdhbi12cy15b3Jrc2hpcmUtZ3JvdXAtMy0xMjQ0MjYxL21hdGNoLXJlcG9ydC0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Root's clock stops on 99 - just as predicted,"Glamorgan 149 (Brook 3-13 Patterson 3-27) and 108 for 3 (Carlson 44* Lloyd 40*) lead Yorkshire 230 (Root 99 Patterson 47* Neser 5-39) by 28 runs

Joe Root moved inexorably towards his hundred with the precision of a ticking clock. An old-time image for an old-time innings. The world could do much as it pleased nothing would change his tempo. Then on 99 the clock stopped.

Root has 31 first-class hundreds but only eight of them have come for Yorkshire. Even as a feted international player one who bears an onerous responsibility as England's Test captain his desire to succeed for his county remains implanted. He would surely yearn for more.

Medium-pacer Dan Douthwaite  who seamed the ball back sharply between bat and pad was the bowler who stopped time. What's more Douthwaite revealed his teammate Kiran Carlson predicted it.

""It was weird how it happened"" Douthwaite said. "" Kiran Carlson stood at mid-off two balls before and said I was going to get him out trying to dab it down to third man and he would chop it on to the stumps and he did. I was telling him at the time to go away and let me focus on my bowling. That is the first time I have had someone predict a wicket and it has actually happened.""

If Root didn't quite manage the century that had seemed inevitable he looked in good trim ahead of the New Zealand Test series. His superbly controlled innings gave Yorkshire a chance of victory. That's if you don't believe in weather forecasts - Sunday's analysis suggests that these sides will be collecting draw points.

England's IPL contingent have spent much of the past fortnight in quarantine while the likes of Root have benefited from an extensive programme of Championship cricket albeit played in empty stadiums and in largely cheerless conditions. It has not been a cakewalk. Remove his century against Kent at Canterbury and he had made 114 runs in seven innings. That rediscovered rhythm had been hard-won.

That Root's success has been far from automatic illustrates that bowlers have held sway and also points to the difficulties that even the most driven world-class player encounters when the prestige of a fixture diminishes and the pressure relents. Nevertheless it also tells that this season's Conference structure has not been a succession of mismatches that many anticipated. It is a format that is gaining popularity and makes the structure for 2022 a debate still to be won and lost.

Glamorgan down 81 on first innings and seeded fifth out of six in Group One might have capitulated when the Australian Marnus Labuschagne  was bowled for a duck in an awkward 26-over finish to the day but David Lloyd and Carlson played with typical freedom in slightly easing conditions in giving them a lead of 27 runs with seven wickets remaining at the close. Carlson's batting approach does not suffer from modesty and with his 23rd birthday hours away he looked to be a player worth keeping an eye on.

Not that Root defied Glamorgan single-handedly in giving Yorkshire that 81-run lead. At 111 for 8 they were imperilled still 39 behind in seamer-friendly conditions. For a top-order batsman eight-down often demands a rethink. Root observed his captain Steven Patterson  and recognised a mulishness that demanded respect. Between them another 118 were added in 33 overs. The match shifted.

Root was accomplished his innings stripped down to basics and all risks against the moving ball kept to a minimum. Patterson existed on defiance and an occasional square cut that he delivered with a flourish. He was far from rhythmic: if he had been a ticking clock nobody would have had a clue what time it was. He survived a tough chance to backward point before he had scored took several blows to the body and stubbornly insisted on his right to stick around. But his commitment was exemplary and he also deserved - and missed - his own statistical landmark a fifth first-class 50 when he was left stranded on 47.

Glamorgan's tactics were strange. The Australian Michael Neser  who had 3 for 15 overnight soon had a five-for including the frisky debutant wicketkeeper Harry Duke who was treated to a bouncer first ball took it on and spliced a catch to square leg. (First-ball duck or not we will hear more of Duke). But Neser only bowled eight overs all day and must surely have a niggle.

Michael Hogan the other senior strike bowler spent the day bowling into the wind. The next bouncer of note to the ninth-wicket pair was delivered by Labuschagne a part-time legspinner and it disappeared for four byes. Andrew Salter had a spell of off-spin more out of respect than logic. Like Dom Bess an England offspinner in Yorkshire's side he would have been better rendered idle."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why."

The McDonald’s at 2200 Broadway Avenue will officially be closing its doors and shutting down on Sunday May 16.

The Broadway McDonald’s carries with it a bit of fast-food historical significance. A plaque near the counter states that the location is the “World’s First McDonald’s ‘Mini Mac’” with a founding date of June 1981.

As a Mini Mac this smaller-than-normal McDonald’s has never been home to a large children’s play area or fancy modern décor. Instead the Mini Mac lived up to its name and featured a counter for walk-up service a basic dining area enclosed with glass paneling on one side two stone outdoor dining tables and a single-lane drive-thru.

In a statement provided by the McDonald’s Corporation Broadway location owner and operator Larry Peters addressed the closing.

“McDonald’s reviews its restaurant portfolio on a regular basis to make the best decisions for our business moving forward. After more than 40 years our restaurant at 2200 Broadway in Bay City is closing. We have been honored to serve our loyal customers and be part of this community” Peters said.

Peters added in the statement that employees were offered alternative employment opportunities due to the closure.

“All of our employees were offered positions at our other local McDonald’s restaurants” Peters said. “We encourage customers to visit us at our other Bay City locations: 901 S Euclid 6325 W Side Saginaw Road or 314 Washington Avenue.”

Customers were also recently provided with coupons that announced the closing and that also included a statement from Peters.

“I would like to thank you for your support. It has been an honor and privilege to serve you all these years” read the coupon.

Walmart McDonald's and other chains shortened hours in response to COVID-19.

Some retailers are trying to return to 24/7 service but they can't find workers.

One expert thinks overnight shopping will return eventually.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The US is finally reopening after more than a year of COVID-19 restrictions but some things may never be the same.

In the spring of 2020 as people locked down to slow the spead of the coronavirus retailers adjusted schedules to make extra time for cleaning stores. Restaurants and shops with 24 hour operating schedules were most affected. Walmart adjusted hours so stores could close early for nightly cleanings and 7-Eleven recommended owners close at midnight. Not all McDonald's were open 24 hours before the pandemic but many closed dining rooms and shortened hours as safety precautions.

Restrictions are finally lifting as more of the population gets vaccinated but conditions aren't what they were before making it unlikely stores will return to 24/7 hours any time soon. Workers are hesitant to take on the risks of nighttime schedules people have changed their shopping habits during and pandemic and the labor shortage is making staffing stores and restaurants extremely difficult.

Nearly half of all US restaurants say they are ""severely understaffed""and even getting applicants in the door has been a struggle. Some chains are turning to large-scale hiring events to screen swaths of candidates at once with perks like cash just for showing up and drive-thru interviews at some stores.

7-Eleven which has thousands of locations run by franchisees told owner-operators to return to pre-pandemic hours in May.

The National Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees (NCASEF) which represents about 7200 US locations sent a letter to corporate leaders saying the shortage of workers and higher operating costs have led to a ""very dire"" situation.

Staying open for longer hours as the company has instructed owners to do by May 24 isn't feasible they said. Franchisees say finding staff for overnight shifts is ""extremely challenging"" and overnight sales do not necessarily cover the costs of labor.

Low traffic overnight hours can also bring risks of theft violence and intoxicated drivers which may not be worth it to many operators or workers.

McDonald's which just announced plans to raise wages at company-owned restaurants is suffering from many of the same issues. Franchisees who can't find staff to cover hours largely blame enhanced unemployment benefits.

""Why work when you can get more staying home?"" one McDonald's franchisee previously told Insider. ""Stimulus and unemployment are killing the workforce."" At least one location has resorted to offering $50 payments for interviewing and another in Fayetteville North Carolina is reportedly offering a $500 signing bonus. Some locations though are back to 24 hour service.

For retailers with a franchise model operators and corporate have different incentives Mark Kalinowski of Kalinowski Equity Research told Insider. From an operator standpoint franchisees like the 7-Eleven letter signees ""might sell at night but not profitably"" Kalinowski said. Meanwhile corporate is incentivized to push for more royalties that could come from longer hours.







Walmart has extended shopping hours from the original cut last March. US stores closed by 8:30 pm as of March 2020 and in November 2020 Walmart adjusted scheduled again so that stores would stay open until 11 pm but there has been no indication of plans to further expand back to 24 hour operation. Walmart did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

While 24/7 shopping and dining is unlikely to return any time soon experts aren't convinced its' gone forever. In the short term a lack of workers will make it difficult for businesses to expand hours Kalinowski told Insider but ""if there's consumer demand operators will figure out how to make it happen.""

While Kalinowski thinks extended hours will make a ""substantial return"" experts are unsure when to expect these changes.

However while lattes frappes and cappuccinos may give you a big caffeine jolt in the morning it's worth mentioning that some of these delicious beverages can pack on a lot of sugar fat and calories making it important to order with caution if you are trying to look out for your waistline.

To help you order the right McDonald's items next time you're on a time crunch we spoke to registered dietitian Summer Yule MS RD about all the best and worst beverage options available on the McCafe menu. From coffee and lattes to hot chocolate here are some drink orders she says are worth avoiding next time you visit the drive-thu.

The Worst McCafe Drinks At McDonald's

Mocha Frappe

Per medium : 500 calories 20 g fat (13 g saturated fat 1 g trans fat) 150 mg sodium 73 g carbs (1 g fiber 66 g sugar) 8 g protein

A medium mocha frappe contains the same number of calories as two McDonald's hamburgers. Yikes! It also contains 13 grams of saturated fat and 66 grams of sugar which is one of the highest amounts of sugar on the entire McCafe menu. Even a McDonald's Cookie has less sugar—if you eat three cookies you still won't reach the amount that is in this drink.

Caramel Frappe

Per medium : 510 calories 21 g fat (13 g saturated fat 1 g trans fat) 150 mg sodium 72 g carbs (0 g fiber 67 g sugar) 8 g protein

Yule says that this frappe is also worth passing on as it is similar nutritionally to the Mocha Frappe with 510 calories 13 grams of saturated fat and 67 grams of sugar.

Hot Chocolate

Per medium : 450 calories 16 g fat (10 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 210 mg sodium 63 g carbs (2 g fiber 58 g sugar) 14g protein

""I recommend that people trying to lose weight limit their consumption of sugary drinks because the calories add up very quickly"" Yule says. Because hot chocolate is a favorite of little ones and those looking for a caffeine-free beverage on McCafe's menu it's important to order your hot chocolate in a small size. This one swap will save you 80 calories and 10 grams of sugar making this sip slightly more reasonable—although still a once-in-a-while treat.

Caramel Mocha

Per medium : 380 calories 14 g fat (8 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 280 mg sodium 54 g carbs (0 g fiber 49 g sugar) 11 g protein

""If you want a sugary drink at McDonald's it's best to stick with drinks that have fewer calories than a 250-calorie hamburger"" Yule says. With 380 calories eight grams of saturated fat and 49 grams of sugar the caramel mocha does not fit the bill. However if you can't part with that sweet caramel taste you'll love to know that some caramel-flavored drinks make our ""best"" list of McCafe drinks—keep reading!

Mocha

Per medium : 380 calories 12 g fat (7 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 160 mg sodium 57 g carbs (2 g fiber 52 g sugar) 10 g protein

Surprisingly removing the ""Caramel"" from the ""Caramel Mocha"" to make this Mocha drink results in an additional three grams of sugar and one less gram of protein. Similar to the caramel mocha Yule says you'll want to steer clear of this medium-sized drink.

Iced Mocha

Per medium : 320 calories 11 g fat (7 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 125 mg sodium 48 g carbs (2 g fiber 43 g sugar) 8 g protein

""It may be wise to think of some of these drinks like a dessert rather than part of a meal"" Yule says. Putting your mocha on ice does not improve the nutritional profile she says as it is still loaded with calories saturated fat and sugar.

French Vanilla Latte

Per medium : 290 calories 9 g fat (5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 125 mg sodium 42 g carbs (0 g fiber 41 g sugar) 10 g protein

""You are definitely getting a lot of sugar with the French Vanilla Latte"" Yule says. And at 290 calories this is just another drink choice that is better suited as a dessert. You'd be consuming a similar nutritional profile if you ordered McDonald's Hot Fudge Sundae which is 330 calories and 44 grams of sugar.

Caramel Latte

Per medium : 320 calories 10 g fat (5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 420 mg sodium 48 g carbs (0 g fiber 45 g sugar) 11 g protein

""The caramel latte fares no better in the nutrition department than the French vanilla latte"" Yule says. The two drinks have similar amounts of sugar and calories.

Caramel Macchiato

Per medium : 320 calories 9 g fat (5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 420 mg sodium 50 g carbs (0 g fiber 45 g sugar) 10 g protein

Even though a latte only contains espresso whole milk and water while a macchiato contains whole milk caramel syrup water caramel drizzle and espresso this multiple-ingredient macchiato is just as bad as the simpler latte. ""This beverage is very similar to the caramel latte as far as nutrition is concerned"" Yule says. ""I would expect no less from a drink that is mixed with sweet caramel syrup and topped with ribbons of buttery caramel.""

Iced Caramel Latte

Per medium : 270 calories 8 g fat (4.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 340 mg sodium 40 g carbs (0 g fiber 36 g sugar) 9 g protein

""The iced caramel latte is a slightly lighter version of the hot version of the drink likely because the addition of ice leaves less room for added sugar in the drink"" Yule says. And at 270 calories 4.5 grams of saturated fat and 36 grams of sugar this beverage may not be the worst of the worst but it isn't healthy either.

Caramel Cappuccino

Per medium : 260 calories 6 g fat (3.5 g saturated fat) 380 mg sodium 44 g carbs (0 g fiber 40 g sugar) 8 g protein

The addition of caramel syrup to the plain cappuccino moves this drink from the best to the worst list Yule explains as a regular McCafe Cappuccino contains only 160 calories and 12 grams of sugar.

Iced Caramel Macchiato

Per medium : 310 calories 10 g fat (6 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 370 mg sodium 45 g carbs (0 g fiber 41 g sugar) 11 g protein

""If someone is looking to lose weight I'd ask them to think about whether the burger or this drink would leave them feeling more full"" Yule says noting the high calorie count of this drink. She notes that it's always best to avoid drinking your calories if you are looking to lose weight as a study published in the Journal of The American Dietetic Association revealed that participants given apple juice in a study missed out on the filling fiber that participants eating a whole apple (or applesauce) were getting.

Likewise when you choose certain sugar-sweetened McCafe beverages you end up getting calories without the protein (and or fiber) that can help keep you full Yule explains. If you're trying to maintain a healthy weight she says that regularly choosing sugar-sweetened beverages may sabotage your efforts in the long run.

The Best McCafe Drinks At McDonald's

McCafe Premium Roast Coffee

Per medium : 0 calories 0 g fat 25 mg sodium 2 g carbs (0 g fiber 0 g sugar) 2 g protein

""If you are trying to lose weight keeping things simple by sticking with black coffee gives you a zero-calorie drink"" Yule says. In addition she notes that is one of the few McCafe options with no added sugar making it something to order if you are looking to cut down on consuming too many sweetened drinks.

McCafe Americano Coffee

Per medium : 0 calories 0 g fat 15 mg sodium 0 g carbs (0 g fiber 0 g sugar) 0 g protein

An Americano coffee drink is diluted espresso which gives it a similar strength to coffee but it has a slightly different flavor. ""This drink (made with Rainforest Alliance Certified espresso) is another calorie-free way to get your caffeine fix"" Yule says. And because it contains zero calories that also means it contains no added sugars another plus.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

McCafe Latte

Per medium : 190 calories 10 g fat (6 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 135 mg sodium 15 g carbs (0 g fiber 15 g sugar) 10 g protein

""If you need a hot drink this unsweetened latte contains 190 calories six grams of saturated fat and 15 grams of [sugar only from the added whole milk]"" Yule says. Skip the option to add additional flavors if you don't want added sugars in your drink she advises as added sugar contains nothing but empty calories. In contrast she notes that the sugar in milk (lactose) is packaged with a number of nutrients that can benefit the body such as calcium riboflavin vitamin B12 vitamin A as well as protein. Additionally she mentions that milk contains macronutrients other than carbohydrates that help lessen the blood sugar spike that you get compared to plain table sugar.

McCafe Cappuccino

Per medium : 160 calories 8 g fat (5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 110 mg sodium 13 g carbs (0 g fiber 12 g sugar) 8 g protein

""One cup of plain unsweetened milk gives you 12 grams of milk sugar and about 30% of your daily recommended amount of calcium which is exactly what you get with the medium unsweetened cappuccino"" Yule says. Most of the drinks containing milk offer the option of skim or whole milk she says so be sure to pick skim to cut back on calories and saturated fat even further.

McCafe Iced Caramel Mocha

Per medium : 300 calories 11 g fat (7 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 210 mg sodium 43 g carbs (0 g fiber 38 g sugar) 7 g protein

""If you are looking for a sweetened drink that doesn't completely break the calorie bank consider choosing this iced caramel mocha"" Yule says. It contains 38 grams of sugar but only 4% of your daily recommended amount of calcium meaning you don't get as much milk as you do in the latte or cappuccino she adds. And if you're wondering what the importance is of not getting much milk as the latte or cappuccino Yule says that it is recommended in the Dietary Guidelines that adults aim for three servings of dairy/calcium-fortified dairy alternatives daily so choosing a drink with milk helps you toward that goal.

McCafe Iced French Vanilla Coffee

Per medium : 170 calories 7 g fat (4.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 65 mg sodium 26 g carbs (0 g fiber 23 g sugar) 3 g protein

""The Iced French Vanilla Coffee has 170 calories 23 grams of sugar and 4.5 grams of saturated fat"" Yule says. You also get a little calcium in this drink.

McCafe French Vanilla Cappuccino

Per medium : 230 calories 6 g fat (3.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 85 mg sodium 37 g carbs (0 g fiber 36 g sugar) 7 g protein

""At 230 calories the French Vanilla Cappuccino is not one of the lightest options on the best list but it does give you 20% of your daily recommended amount of calcium and seven grams of protein"" Yule says. It also contains fewer calories than a McDonald's Hamburger she notes and it contains less than half of the calories of the frappe drinks on the menu.

Iced French Vanilla Latte

Per medium : 240 calories 8 g fat (4.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 105 mg sodium 36 g carbs (0 g fiber 34 g sugar) 8 g protein

If you want a latte that has been sweetened she says that this is definitely one of the better beverage options to try as Yule acknowledges that it contains 220 milligrams of calcium and 6% of your daily recommended value of vitamin A.

Vitamin A is essential in maintaining normal vision and the immune system according to the National Institutes of Health. And given the daily recommended range of vitamin A ranges from 700 to 1300 micrograms a day this latte can help give your levels a much-needed boost.

Iced Coffee

Per medium : 180 calories 7 g fat (4.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 65 mg sodium 30 g carbs (0 g fiber 28 g sugar) 2 g protein

""If plain black coffee just won't do this iced coffee order adds a little sugar and light cream for sweetness while staying under 200 calories"" Yule says.

Iced Caramel Coffee

Per medium : 190 calories 7 g fat (4.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 300 mg sodium 31 g carbs (0 g fiber 26 g sugar) 4 g protein

""A medium iced caramel coffee adds caramel syrup and light cream while keeping things under 200 calories"" Yule says. You'll also get 10% of your daily recommended amount of calcium with this drink. If you're trying to stay away from dairy you can also get your calcium from these calcium-rich vegetarian food sources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhldmlsbGFnZXN1bi5jb20vd2hlcmVzLXRoZS1iZWVmLWZvcm1lci13LTNyZC1zdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtc3BhY2Utc2l0cy1lbXB0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where's the beef?

Where’s the beef? Former W. 3rd St. McDonald’s space sits empty

BY THE VILLAGE SUN | Locals are still digesting the closure of the McDonald’s on W. Third St. off of Sixth Ave.

The place which closed in January definitely was not all Happy Meals but the frequent scene of mayhem and police blotter reports.

Time Out called it the city’s “most infamously chaotic McDonald’s.” Bowery Boogie dubbed it the “notorious West 3rd Street McDonald’s.”

Jim Drougas the owner of Unoppressive Non-imperialist Bargain Books nearby on Carmine St. was among those not sad to see the fast-food joint go.

“The most remarkable thing about that McDonald’s was after it closed at night it was a rat trap” he said. “There would be hundreds of rats on 6-foot-high garbage bags on the curb.

“There was never a good feeling about that place.”

He recalled how Gerde’s Folk City used to be right next to the spot. Bob Dylan played his first professional show at Gerde’s though at an earlier location on W. Fourth St. before the club moved to W. Third St. in 1970.

“McDonald’s was the downfall of the Village in my view” Drougas said. “It was a whole different kind of nourishment. I hope they stay empty forever” he scoffed of the vacant storefront.

The tawdry sex stores along Sixth Ave. also were part of the “downfall of the Village” he added.

Asked what he actually would like to see open in the former burger space he offered “A bargain bookstore. A folk music venue. …”

After mulling it over a bit more he said “Maybe they’ll make it into a giant CBD/legal marijuana store with food for munchies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIxMDUxNDAwMDU1M9IBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjEwNTE0MDAwNTUz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald’s to introduce uniform with Hangeul characters for BTS meal,"McDonald’s uniform designs (Captured from SAINT’s twitter account) McDonald’s uniform designs (Captured from SAINT’s twitter account)

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItMTA1NjU5NjE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"FILE PHOTO: The Merck logo is seen at a gate to the Merck & Co campus in Rahway New Jersey New Jersey

(Reuters) - Merck said on Thursday its therapy being tested in certain patients with a type of cancer in the uterus lining failed a late-stage trial.

The drugmaker's Keytruda therapy in combination with chemotherapy was being evaluated in about 1095 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery.

The trial did not meet the main goal of disease-free survival which is the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or its symptoms.

The study's other main goal of overall survival was not formally tested since the trial failed in showing significant disease-free survival.

Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium and is the most common type of the disease affecting the organ.

Merck's Keytruda belongs to a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to detect and fight tumor cells.

Keytruda is currently approved in the United States for two indications in endometrial cancer one of which is treated using it as a combination therapy with partner Eisai's drug Lenvima.

Endometrial cancer leads to more than 13000 deaths in a year in the U.S. according to government data.

At a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy did not meet the study’s pre-specified statistical criteria for DFS compared to placebo plus adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since superiority was not reached for DFS. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing. Merck will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community.

""While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of KEYTRUDA in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications while rapidly progressing clinical research evaluating KEYTRUDA-based combinations and other investigational candidates including antibody-drug conjugates in endometrial and other types of gynecologic malignancies"" said Dr. Gursel Aktan vice president global clinical development Merck Research Laboratories. ""We would like to thank all the patients the investigators and our study collaborators for their participation in this trial.""

In the U.S. KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in endometrial cancer. One indication based on KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 is in combination with LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) in collaboration with Eisai for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) as determined by an FDA-approved test or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. The second indication based on KEYNOTE-158 is as a single agent for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) as determined by an FDA-approved test who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.

Story continues

Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program in endometrial carcinoma including the NRG-GY018/KEYNOTE-868 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) followed by KEYTRUDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. As previously announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) based on this study and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) or target action date of June 21 2024.

The program also includes the KEYNOTE-C93 study evaluating KEYTRUDA versus chemotherapy in dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma as well as the MK-2870-005 study evaluating sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT) an investigational trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) being developed in collaboration with Kelun-Biotech compared to a treatment of physicians’ choice in patients with endometrial carcinoma who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

About KEYNOTE-B21/ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053

KEYNOTE-B21 also known as ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053 is a randomized double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04634877) sponsored by Merck and conducted in collaboration with the European Network for Gynecologic Oncology Trial (ENGOT) groups and the GOG Foundation Inc. (GOG) investigating adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy compared to adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery with curative intent. The primary endpoints are DFS and OS and secondary endpoints include safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 1095 patients who were randomized to receive:

KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for six cycles) plus concurrent standard of care chemotherapy (for four or six cycles) followed by KEYTRUDA (400 mg every six weeks for an additional six cycles) with or without radiotherapy or

Placebo (every three weeks for six cycles) plus concurrent standard of care chemotherapy (for four or six cycles) followed by placebo (every six weeks for an additional six cycles) with or without radiotherapy.

About endometrial carcinoma

Endometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus which is known as the endometrium and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. In the U.S. it is estimated there will be approximately 67880 patients diagnosed with uterine body cancer and approximately 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024. Globally endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the 15th most common cancer overall. Following primary treatment patients face a risk of their cancer returning often as distant metastasis which is associated with poorer outcomes.

About Merck’s research in breast and gynecologic cancers

Merck is advancing research aimed at improving outcomes for patients affected by breast and gynecologic (ovarian cervical and endometrial) cancers. Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program across these cancers comprised of more than 20 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 studies evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA currently has two approved indications for triple-negative breast cancer including one for high-risk early-stage disease and five approved indications across certain types of cervical and endometrial cancers (see indications below). Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of these cancers as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.

About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program

Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD- L1 and PD-L2 thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.

Endometrial Carcinoma

KEYTRUDA in combination with LENVIMA is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) as determined by an FDA-approved test or not MSI-H who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.

KEYTRUDA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR as determined by an FDA-approved test who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway thereby removing inhibition of the immune response potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions which may be severe or fatal can occur in any organ system or tissue can affect more than one body system simultaneously and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes creatinine and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting monitor blood cortisol at baseline prior to surgery and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies including infection. Institute medical management promptly including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including fatal (0.1%) Grade 4 (0.3%) Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 77% had resolution.

Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC including fatal (0.2%) Grade 4 (0.3%) and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 71% had resolution.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 4 (<0.1%) Grade 3 (1.1%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 4 (<0.1%) Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

KEYTRUDA With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4 n=116) ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55) recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA 16 patients receiving axitinib and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.

Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis including Stevens-Johnson syndrome drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis pericarditis vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis encephalitis myelitis and demyelination myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation) Guillain-Barré syndrome nerve paresis autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment including blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels gastritis duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae including renal failure) arthritis (1.5%) polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis systemic inflammatory response syndrome histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis) sarcoidosis immune thrombocytopenic purpura solid organ transplant rejection other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) acute and chronic GVHD hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

About LENVIMA® (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules

LENVIMA discovered and developed by Eisai is an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1) VEGFR2 (KDR) and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis tumor growth and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4 the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) KIT and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages increased activated cytotoxic T cells and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone.

Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA

Warnings and Precautions

Hypertension. In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC.

Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC RCC and HCC grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials.

Among patients receiving LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%).

Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.

Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events including hepatic failure acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome occurred in 0.5% of patients. In HCC hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 2% of patients discontinued LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% discontinued due to hepatic failure.

Monitor liver function prior to initiation then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Renal Failure or Impairment. Serious including fatal renal failure or impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment was reported in 14% and 7% of LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC respectively. Grade 3-5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% of patients with DTC and 2% of patients with HCC including 1 fatal event in each study. In RCC renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (10% grade 3).

Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue for renal failure or impairment based on severity.

Proteinuria. In DTC and HCC proteinuria was reported in 34% and 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in DTC and HCC respectively. In RCC proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus (8% grade 3). Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC RCC and HCC fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.

QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%. In RCC QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%.

Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome congestive heart failure bradyarrhythmias or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.

Hypocalcemia. In DTC grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.

Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC RCC and HCC clinical trials hemorrhagic events of any grade occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds including fatal hemorrhagic events occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.

Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.

Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.

Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors such as bisphosphonates denosumab dental disease or invasive dental procedures may increase the risk of ONJ.

Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.

Avoid invasive dental procedures if possible while on LENVIMA treatment particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.

Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.

Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity fetotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.

For years Facebook has grappled with the thorny question of who should be the ultimate “arbiter of truth” when it comes to moderating content on its near ubiquitous social media platform.

Mark Zuckerberg chief executive and ultimate decision maker has agreed that it should not be him — semi-outsourcing the problem to a group of his own making called the Facebook Oversight Board.

Comprising 20 journalists academics and politicians this board is tasked with issuing judgments on the most high-profile content moderation cases. Facebook casts it as an independent almost quasi-judicial body or “supreme court” for speech.

But the effort is laden with complexities as the board’s recent decision to uphold a ban on former US president Donald Trump using Facebook has shown.

Some of the main points of contention have been whether the board is independent enough and its scope broad enough.

It is currently funded — through a $130m trust — by Facebook. And it has binding authority over a very narrow type of case: whether a removed piece of content should be reinstated or an offensive post should come down and whether users should remain banned. It only hears a handful of these a year.

“It’s still looking at that very narrow slice of what content moderation is namely how Facebook treats individual posts” says Evelyn Douek a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “It doesn’t look at things like groups pages down-ranking decisions how the news feed works in terms of prioritisation how Facebook treats entire accounts.”

Facebook’s fiercest critics believe this renders the board a toothless “sham” and that the company is merely trying to prove a self-regulation model works in order to stave off any legislation that could actually hurt its business.

“It’s a made-up corporate PR tool” says Jesse Lehrich co-founder of the campaign group Accountable Tech. “I’m so frustrated by the notion that this thing that was created by Facebook — for Facebook to shirk their own responsibility — is being treated like a ‘supreme court’.”

Some of these fears were borne out in the board’s ruling this month on whether or not former president Donald Trump should remain banned from the platform for violence-inciting speech that helped fuel the Capitol riots in January.

The board upheld the suspension but pushed the decision on Trump’s ultimate fate — whether this should be permanent or not — straight back to Facebook.

In an admission of the limitations of its own clout — and perhaps a snipe at Facebook — the board also noted that the company refused to answer seven requests for more information that it had submitted.

These included for example how Facebook’s news feed had affected how many people saw Trump’s posts. The board said there were numerous vague reasons cited by Facebook to explain their refusals but these were light on detail.

“If this was a court you would have filings to that effect” says Nate Persily a professor at Stanford Law School. He notes that a legal case would be more transparent: the board would have to publish exactly what it was requesting from Facebook which in turn would have to lay out precisely why it was not handing over the information.

Whether the board’s mission is ideologically biased or its principles are clear are other questions to have raised by critics.

In its charter Facebook outlines international human rights law as one of its guiding principles and several experts in the field sit on the board. However some experts argue that this jars: international human rights law is designed to govern states not private companies.

To some this approach lends weight to the argument that Facebook is in effect a public utility or a quasi-world government with ultimate power over free speech. But if a government were to ban nudity for example as Facebook does in its community guidelines that would be at odds with human rights law.

“The problem is it buys into the idea that Facebook is a government and the news feed is a public square” says Persily. “International human rights are not what the Facebook community standards are about. You have to think about what kind of rules can be applied at scale in very rapid decision-making contexts.”

In any case under the First Amendment platforms have almost complete discretion to decide what speech they will host and an individual does not have a right to be able to use their services according to Douek.

This leaves the board hashing out new ground. But should a Facebook-backed entity really be the body to do this? Could a central regulatory body be the better alternative?

Emily Bell

Emily Bell director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University advocates for an agency that can look across the tech platforms and exercise real powers — for example to audit the companies and their secretive algorithms. “That has to be a separate regulator with its power coming from legislation not Zuckerberg’s cheque book” she says. “I don’t want the Federal Aviation Administration overseen by Boeing.”

But this poses the question: should each nation have such a body leaving Facebook with fragmented rules from country to country? And what if a country takes a repressive censoring stance on speech? Facebook has already been forced to accede to requests from authorities in India Thailand and Vietnam to take down comments posted by dissidents.

A supranational body would conceivably work but this too would have to decide whether to come down more on the side of free speech or human rights.

Many experts argue that the board is the least-worst option — a stance that Facebook itself appears to have taken.

“It is not a perfect answer but it’s the best answer that we can come up with in an imperfect world where there isn’t clear government or public regulation [about] how we should deal with issues like this” said Nick Clegg Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs and communications at the FT Global Boardroom conference this month.

He called it the “germ of an idea” that might later be “taken up in statutory regulation” or expanded with other social media companies coming on board.

Casey Mattox senior fellow at the Charles Koch Institute argues that a self-regulatory body such as the board protects Facebook from politicians “trying to impose their own partisan will on the platforms”. It also guards against Facebook becoming too US-centric in its approach to moderation given its global operations.

There are alternative experiments in the offing though that could yet bear fruit. Among the most thought-provoking are proposals from Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey to solve the free speech dilemma with more technology.

Dorsey has suggested offering users more “algorithmic choice”; do I want my feed to run in reverse chronological order show the most popular posts or automatically filter out certain types of content?

This approach was flagged by Dr Stephen Wolfram founder and chief executive officer of Wolfram Research who has suggested that Big Tech could “open up the pipeline and create a market in which users can make choices for themselves” — essentially letting you the user pick your moderation algorithm from a brand you trust.

Dorsey has now set up a project called Bluesky that is looking into the prospect of making content moderation fully decentralised — an open-source model where users have potentially endless choices. “There are opportunities for more user choice to drive less of a need for [an] external board like this” says Mattox.

But these ideas are nascent. And they still do not quite solve the issue of where the line should be drawn for the most egregious content and who exactly should decide on that.

“Algorithmic answers can create difficult edge cases and you’ll always need to resolve things on the basis of context and circumstances” says Bell. At the end of the day — the buck still stops at a human.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd2luLmdnL25ld3MvdHdpdGNoLWJhbnMtdGVybS1ob3QtdHViLXN0cmVhbWVyLWZyb20tY2hhdC1vbi1pdHMtY2hhbm5lbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Twitch bans term ""hot tub streamer"" from chat on its channels","Twitch has banned the term “hot tub streamer” from their official channel’s chat.

One Reddit user shared a screenshot of the ban happening during a Twitch stream. After someone wrote “hot tub streamers” in the chat they received the following automatic reply: “Your message wasn’t posted due to conflicts with the channel’s moderation settings.”

This immediately riled up the Twitch community who have already expressed disdain for how Twitch is responding to ongoing complaints about the “hot tub meta” on the streaming platform.

Twitch bans “hot tub streamer” as controversy continues

The Reddit post led to a series of complaints from the Twitch community who felt they were being silenced. The banning of the term “hot tub streamer” made them feel like Twitch was further avoiding any action in regards to the continued frustrations with the number of hot tub streams. Instead of responding to people’s arguments and concerns Twitch appeared to be completely silencing anyone who spoke up on the channel.

Throughout 2021 some Twitch viewers have expressed disdain for the “hot tub meta” on the streaming platform. This refers to the growing amount of streamers mostly female that strip down to a revealing outfit and chat from an inflatable pool or hot tub while broadcasting.

A lot of people have shared their reasoning behind the frustration. The usual complaints include that the suggestive content is not appropriate for children and that it’s ruining the reputation of Twitch which used to be centered around gaming. Some hot tub streamers have used the live content to advertise their OnlyFans sometimes even sending out links to their accounts in emails to subscribers.

While some hot tub streamers have faced light consequences for actions taken during their hot tub streams most of the women have not faced any repercussions from Twitch. This has led many to feel that the streaming platform is inconsistent and even “simping” for certain female streamers. That’s because many male streamers have been banned sometimes for over a month for far less explicit content.

Last month Twitch’s head of creator development Marcus “djWHEAT” Graham addressed the ongoing complaints. djWHEAT essentially told hot tub meta haters that they can simply click the “I’m not interested” button. His response further angered those who were already disgruntled with many responding that he wasn’t addressing the actual reasons people were growing angry with Twitch.

“Severely disappointed at djWHEAT and Twitch’s response to the ‘hot tub meta'” streamer Major Arlene tweeted. “It’s incredibly clear you have not watched more than two minutes of any of the streams or you don’t know your own TOS. Reporting systems have done nothing.”

As the backlash continues Twitch has apparently attempted to suppress the growing controversy by banning the term from their official channel. Twitch hasn’t publicly addressed the change to their channel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdHdpdGNoLWFwcGFyZW50bHktYmFucy1ob3QtdHViLWZyb20tb2ZmaWNpYWwtY2hhbm5lbHMtY2hhdC0xNTc0MzQ2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitch apparently bans ‘hot tub’ from official channel’s chat,"As the hot tub meta continues to run wild on Twitch a few users have reported that they are unable to use the phrase in chat messages on the platform’s official channel due to moderation settings.

The ‘hot tub’ meta has taken over Twitch in 2021 with Just Chatting streamers pushing the boundaries as to what is and what isn’t acceptable.

These streams have come under constant criticism from content creators who have raised concerns about the direction in which Twitch is headed while others have just out and out mocked the hot tub streamers with parody broadcasts.

The hot tub streams don’t actually break any rules under Twitch guidelines as bathing suits are permissible as long as they are being worn in an appropriate environment (e.g. a beach or pool). However some users reported that you can’t actually talk about it on Twitch’s own channel.

Twitch/Amouranth Streamers like Amouranth have enjoyed massive success with the new meta.

Twitch viewer and Redditor JitterOS flagged that they’d tried to post the phrase ‘hot tub streamers’ on Twitch’s main channel during their May 14 Public Access broadcast.

In the Redditor’s screenshot their post is followed by the message: ‘Your message wasn’t posted due to conflicts with the channel’s moderation settings.’

This message indicates that a phrase or word has been banned from being used in the chat rather than a ban for the specific user who has posted it.

Screenshot via Twitch The chat message typically indicates that a word/phrase has been banned.

Some other users criticized Twitch for seemingly blocking the phrase stating that they “solved that issue the easy way by avoiding people complaining about the subject.”

One other posted joked: “Guess we’ll have to call them warm water container broadcasters now.”

Dexerto has since tested posting the phrase ‘hot tub streamers’ in Twitch’s own chat and there was no message this time around which suggests that either a change has been made since or it was a bug the first time around.

The kid is on top of the world ladies and gents.

Zach Wilson the New York Jets quarterback and next face of the franchise has completed rookie minicamp is finished with the get-to-know-you phase and already seems comfortable in his new Northern New Jersey surroundings.

Recently the BYU product visited MetLife Stadium with love in his emoji-filled eyes per his official Instagram account.

He decided to visit the place next door to where Jimmy Hoffa was supposedly buried all these many years. (It’s an urban legend of course but one that’s fun to reference from time to time.)

In other words not to go too dark and confuse the youngsters Wilson took his new ride out to his new professional Sunday home MetLife Stadium.

Sunday Stadium? Check. New ride? Check. New weapon and off-field friend in Elijah Moore? Check. New Jets attitude that’s already permeating through the building including the front office and coaching staff? Check.

Everything is coming together nicely for the Jets’ new quarterback. He’s even pleased with his new surroundings.

What the Florham Park/Morristown NJ area turned out to be was a breath of fresh air for the Draper UT native.

“It’s a very pretty beautiful place very green so I’m excited to be here” Wilson told reporters during rookie minicamp last weekend. “The biggest thing I learned is that this area is not a city lifestyle I mean it’s great. If you want the city you’re close by. You can hop on the train or drive down but it’s cool that we’re in the suburbs (and) we’re kind of away. It’s an easy place to focus on football and just be able to get what you’re supposed to get done.”

Zach Wilson is on top of the world a feeling and narrative he and the rest of the New York Jets organization hope lasts for a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Poker players are starting to look each other in the eye again.

The plexiglass dividers that have been a staple of Las Vegas poker rooms during the coronavirus pandemic have come down this week at several casinos after they were approved to return to 100 percent capacity by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The Orleans on Saturday became the latest poker room to remove its plexiglass.

“It is down as of early this morning!” Orleans poker room manager Garrett Okahara said via email.

Poker rooms that have removed the plexiglass include the Caesars Entertainment properties (Bally’s Caesars Palace Flamingo and Planet Hollywood Resort); MGM Resorts properties (Aria Bellagio and MGM Grand); Station Casinos properties (Boulder Station Red Rock Resort and Santa Fe Station); and Wynn Las Vegas (room located in Encore).

The Golden Nugget South Point and The Venetian still have plexiglass in place.

The removal of plexiglass dividers signals a return to normalcy for poker in Las Vegas after it was upended along with most other pastimes by the pandemic.

Casinos reopened June 5 after the initial shutdown because of the pandemic in March 2020 and the Orleans and South Point immediately brought back their poker rooms. The Venetian followed the next day and more rooms gradually came back over the next few months.

Games started with four players allowed at each table under social distancing guidelines then five-handed games were quickly approved. While many poker players returned to action the games were a far cry from the normal nine- and 10-handed tables.

The Bellagio opened a new phase of pandemic poker when it installed plexiglass dividers that allowed six-handed games starting June 18. The other poker rooms quickly followed suit.

Eventually regulators allowed rooms to offer eight-handed games with dividers and that remained the standard until this week.

So far most of the rooms that have removed the dividers have chosen to stick with eight-handed play instead of reverting to the normal nine or 10. The Wynn is playing nine-handed and the Orleans said it would go to nine-handed for tournaments while sticking with eight-handed for cash games.

“Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year” the Orleans poker room posted on Twitter.

Good morning poker players! With the recent removal of our plexiglass dividers tournaments at the Orleans will be played 9-handed effective immediately. Cash games will still be 8-handed for the time being. Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year. — OrleansPokerRoom (@OrleansPokerRo1) May 15 2021

With face masks now optional at many resorts for fully vaccinated patrons poker this summer could look like what it was before the pandemic.

Henderson poker pro and YouTube personality Jeff Sluzinski who goes by Jeff Boski online hailed the removal of plexiglass Friday.

“A timeless moment in poker history” he said on Twitter.

Sipple: A dose of reality for Husker fans; Brooks a rare force; and Pac-12’s surprise,"Things I know and things I think I know:

Ernest Hemingway once tossed out this pearl of wisdom.

“Write hard and clear about what hurts” he said.

After early growth as a Husker Isaiah Stalbird takes flight at national title hopeful South Dakota State

What kind of movement did spring ball prompt in the Huskers’ projected defensive depth chart?

This is going to hurt Nebraska football fans. But stay with me. There are certain truths we simply need to stare in the face in order to make sense of life. This particular nugget of truth comes from Bill Bender of The Sporting News who made an appearance Friday on “Early Break” (93.7 FM).

Brace yourselves.

In discussing Ohio State’s unsettled quarterback situation – former five-star prospect CJ Stroud a freshman has the lead in the three-man race entering the summer months – Bender made a good point.

“You know I don’t think it’s going to matter who the quarterback is because if you look at their receiver room … it’s crazy to say this but I think they’ve got at least four or five first-round NFL picks in their receiving room alone” said Bender of Pickerington Ohio in the heart of Buckeye country.

Wonderful news for Nebraska and everyone else in the Big Ten. Just wonderful.

“Well they’ve got two for the next draft in (Chris) Olave and (Garrett) Wilson” Bender said. “With those guys I’d almost guarantee it.”

Sophomores Julian Fleming and Jaxon Smith-Njigba – a pair of former five-star prospects – also have the look of future first-rounders Bender said.

So some perspective: Nebraska hasn’t had an NFL first-round pick at any position since 2011 when cornerback Prince Amukamara went 19th overall to the New York Giants.

“Oh my God” Bender said when told of that fact.

Yes I understand Nebraska needs to set its sights on finishing first in the Big Ten West Division before thinking too much about overtaking perennial power Ohio State. That said Scott Frost and his Husker staff need to always have the Buckeyes in mind. They’re ultimately the standard. They’re what the Huskers want to become.

Along those lines Bender mentioned a name to watch in the Big Ten this season: defensive end Jack Sawyer a freshman from Pickerington. The 6-foot-4 245-pound Sawyer had four sacks in the spring game and people already are comparing him to the Bosa brothers (Nick and Joey) Bender said.

Sawyer was a five-star player in high school and the No. 1 overall player in Ohio in the class of 2021.

This is what Nebraska’s chasing. No sense in hiding from the truth.

“Coach Frost needs to come to Pickerington and grab some of these Ohio kids” Bender said.

If only life were that simple.

* Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos told me that he was never contacted for the Pac-12 commissioner job even though his name surfaced in reports as a possibility for the position.

I completely believe that Moos wasn’t contacted particularly after seeing the Pac-12’s choice for the gig.

If you have never heard of George Kliavkoff before you’re not alone. He comes to the Pac-12 after serving as the president of entertainment and sports for MGM Resorts International a role he has held since 2018. He also served as a member on the WNBA’s Board of Governors BetMGM and Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group during his time at MGM.

President of entertainment and sports? Think about that job description for a second. Not a bad life.

Kliavkoff wasted no time in making clear he’s in favor of playoff expansion in college football.

That’d be one way for the Pac-12 to get a team involved.

* In case you missed it Oklahoma topped ESPN’s post-spring football rankings followed by (in order) Alabama Georgia Clemson Ohio State and Iowa State.

A graduate transfer pops onto the radar for Huskers at defensive back

Life in the Red: Top performers in strength index testing look familiar

The Sooners’ offense is loaded led by a returning starter at quarterback in Spencer Rattler.

Bender though was skeptical about the Sooners being No. 1.

“Some people believe Oklahoma may finally have it on defense at least enough to win a national championship” he said. “We’ll see if that’s the case. I’m always skeptical when it comes to defense in the Big 12.”

* We’ll soon find out if Garth Brooks can sell 90000 tickets for a Memorial Stadium show. He’s a powerful force. In fact he’s a rare force in today’s entertainment world.

He’s part of an extremely small list of performers who could sell out a massive stadium on their own.

Our extremely well-connected entertainment writer L. Kent Wolgamott says Taylor Swift is an example of a performer who might sell 90000 tickets in Lincoln. Kenny Chesney is a gigantic draw as well Wolgamott says.

Could the Foo Fighters sell 90000 tickets in Lincoln?

“I doubt they could sell out the stadium by themselves but on a (tour) package they headline it would be very possible” Wolgamott told “Early Break” listeners.

Any other ideas?

The transaction is expected to be finalized by mid-April and supports Entain’s strategy of expanding into new international markets.

Enlabs has already established itself as a leading gaming organization in the Baltic Countries and is behind some popular online gaming brands including the Nutz Casino and http://ninjacasino.com/fi/vedonlyonti.It’s also the market leader in Latvia the second-largest in Estonia and one of the largest operators in Lithuania.

Chairman of the Board of Enlabs is proud of the company’s achievements as well as the future outlook for its brands. “Enlabs has achieved an enormous amount as an independent business” says he. “But we recognize the trend of industry consolidation and the growing importance of scale.”

The Entain name is just as prominent in the world of sports betting and online gaming. It’s the owner of many established brands such as Ladbrokes Sportingbet and Coral. Their online gaming brands are just as popular including PartyCasino Foxy Bingo and CasinoClub. It’s also in partnership with MGM Resorts to further develop its outreach on sports betting and gaming in the United States. Entain even currently holds licenses in 20 countries across the world.

Entain has been exploring acquisitions in the Baltic region for some time. The company has noted that it’s locally regulated and has a rapidly growing gaming market. Enlabs provides the ideal opportunity due to its high operating standard and customer proposition which is considered market-leading.

Entain explained that the acquisition is a smart move for Enlab as it provides them with a growth opportunity courtesy of Entain’s marketing expertise products and patented technology. “Enlabs is already a strong and rapidly growing business in its own right” said the company. “The acquisition of Enlabs is perfectly aligned with our strategy of expanding across regulated international markets.”

With the deal all but finalized Entain believes the acquisition of Enlabs will also help them expand into adjacent markets such as Belarus and the Ukraine which recently legalized several forms of gambling. The company believes that the combination of scale and diversification will be essential to continue to create shareholder value.

Entain has confirmed the Chairman of the Board of Enlabs will stay with Enlabs to support the transition to a group operation as well providing guidance to the new owners on sustainable growth across the Baltic region. The company has also advised that they have no plans to make any material changes to the operations management or existing employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmRpYW53aXJlLmNvbS9nYW1ibGluZy1jYXNpbm9zL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLW9mLW1nbS1yZXNvcnRzLXRvLW9wZXJhdGUtYXQtZnVsbC1jYXBhY2l0eS1uby1zb2NpYWwtZGlzdGFuY2luZy1yZXF1aXJlZC0zMTI2Mzgv0gGUAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZGlhbndpcmUuY29tL2dhbWJsaW5nLWNhc2lub3MvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtb2YtbWdtLXJlc29ydHMtdG8tb3BlcmF0ZS1hdC1mdWxsLWNhcGFjaXR5LW5vLXNvY2lhbC1kaXN0YW5jaW5nLXJlcXVpcmVkLTMxMjYzOC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas properties of MGM Resorts to operate at full capacity; no social distancing required,"Imagesource:SimpleViews

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

IBM has made a breakthrough in microchip technology: the world’s first 2-nanometer (nm) microchips.

Why this matters: Microchips are the brains of modern computers. They are used in almost every electronic device from smartphones to spacecraft.

Better microchips mean more powerful devices or ones that use less energy.

IBM predicts its 2-nm microchips will be able to provide devices with a 45% boost in processing performance compared to today’s common 7-nm microchips. Alternatively they could decrease a device’s energy consumption by 75%.

This means that our cell phones may only need to be charged every four days our computers could get faster and large scale data centers could drastically reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions. According to IBM if every data center switched to its new chips the savings would be enough to power 43 million homes.

The microchips could also help autonomous cars process visual information or give AIs the ability to analyze mountains of astronomical data more quickly facilitating space exploration efforts.

Truly anything that involves computers could become more powerful if packed with these next-gen microchips — and what doesn’t involve computers?

“There are not many technologies or technological breakthroughs that end up lifting all boats” Darío Gil senior VP and director of IBM Research told CNN. “This is an example of one.”

How it works: The way to increase a microchip’s performance is to increase the number of transistors packed onto it without increasing the chip’s size.

The iPhone 12’s industry leading 5-nm microchips have 11.8 billion transistors. That averages out to 134 million transistors per square millimeter.

IBM was able to fit 50 billion transistors onto the microchip the size of a fingernail (150 square millimeters). That’s 333 million transistors per square millimeter.

So what exactly are transistors?

Modern computing devices operate in binary code meaning everything they do is dictated by strings of 1s and 0s.

Transistors are like tiny faucets for computing devices only instead of water they control the flow of electricity. A transistor being open (with electricity flowing through it) represents a 1 in binary code while a closed transistor represents a 0.

More transistors means faster processing of 1s and 0s but we can’t just make bigger and bigger microchips to hold more and more transistors — the chips aren’t cheap to manufacture and the cost goes up with size.

If we can pack more transistors onto the same sized microchip though we get chips that are both more powerful and more energy efficient without dramatically increasing costs.

“In the end there’s transistors and everything else (in computing) relies on whether that transistor gets better or not” Gil told Reuters.

The cold water: Manufacturing of the 2-nm microchips isn’t expected to begin until 2024 or 2025 — so these chips won’t be able to help with the current global microchip shortage.

Right now there’s far more demand for chips than there is supply and the pandemic deserves the lion’s share of the blame for that situation.

About 80% of chips are made in Asia and the pandemic forced many of those facilities to temporarily shut down in early 2020. COVID-19 also affected the global supply chain and the silicon used for microchips became more scarce because it’s also used to make vaccine vials.

Everything else in computing relies on whether transistors get better or not.

Darío Gil

Automakers also thought the pandemic would have a bigger impact on sales than it did leading them to order too few of the chips needed for its vehicles. When sales rebounded they ran out.

Consumer tech companies meanwhile needed more microchips as their sales increased. People were buying more laptops to facilitate remote work and school — and more gaming consoles to make social distancing less boring.

As if a global pandemic wasn’t difficult enough to navigate the chip industry was also plagued by disaster in early 2021: a cold snap forced the closure of several Texas factories in February a Japanese factory caught fire in March and a drought in Taiwan affected factories there in April.

An Oxford Economics and NTT DATA survey of 1000 business leaders conducted in early 2020 reveals that 96% of companies were at least researching AI solutions and over 70% had either fully implemented or at least piloted the technology.

Nearly half of survey respondents said failure to implement AI would cause them to lose customers with 44% reporting their company’s bottom line would suffer without it.

Simply put AI enables companies to parse vast quantities of business data to make well-informed and critical business decisions fast. And the transportation management industry specifically is using this intelligence and its companion technology machine learning (ML) to gain greater process efficiency and performance visibility driving impactful changes bolstering the bottom line.

Tools reduce costs increase revenue

McKinsey research reveals that 61% of executives report decreased costs and 53% report increased revenues as a direct result of introducing AI into their supply chains. For supply chains lower inventory-carrying costs inventory reductions and lower transportation and labor costs are some of the biggest areas for savings captured by high volume shippers. Further AI boost supply chain management revenue in sales forecasting spend analytics and logistics network optimization.

For the trucking industry and other freight carriers AI is being effectively applied to transportation management practices to help reduce the amount of unprofitable empty miles or “deadhead” trips a carrier makes returning to domicile with an empty trailer after delivering a load. AI also identifies other hidden patterns in historical transportation data to determine the optimal mode selection for freight most efficient labor resource planning truck loading and stop sequences rate rationalization and other process improvement by applying historical usage data to derive better planning and execution outcomes.

The ML portion of this emerging technology helps organizations optimize routing and even plan for weather-driven disruptions. Through pattern recognition for instance ML helps transportation management professionals understand how weather patterns affected the time it took to carry loads in the past then considers current data sets to make predictive recommendations.

Pandemic accelerates adoption of AI and ML

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) put a tremendous amount of pressure on many industries – the transportation industry included – but it also presented a silver lining -- the opportunity for change. Since organizations are increasingly pressed to work smarter to fulfill customers’ expectations and needs there is increased appetite to retire inefficient legacy tools and invest in new processes and tech tools to work more efficiently.

Applying AI and ML to pandemic-posed challenges can be the critical difference between accelerating or slowing growth for transportation management professionals. When applied correctly these technologies improve logistics visibility offer data-driven planning insights and help successfully increase process automation.

Like many emerging technologies promising transformation AI and ML have in many cases been misrepresented or worse overhyped as panaceas for vexing industry challenges. Transportation logistics organizations should be prudent and perform due diligence when considering when and how to introduce AI and ML to their operations. Panicked hiring of data scientists to implement expensive complicated tools and overengineered processes can be a costly boondoggle and can sour the perception of the viability of these truly powerful and useful tech tools. Instead organizations should invest time in learning more about the technology and how it is already driving value for successful adopters in the transportation logistics industry. What are some steps a logistics operation should take as they embark on an AI/ML initiative?

Data quality should come first

Remember that the quality of your data will drive how fast or slow your AI journey will go. The lifeblood of an effective AI program (or any big data project) is proper data hygiene and management. Unfortunately compiling organizing and accessing this data is a major barrier for many. According to a survey conducted by O’Reilly 70% of respondents report that poorly labeled data and unlabeled data are a significant challenge. Other common data quality issues respondents cited include poor data quality from third-party sources (~42%) disorganized data stores and lack of metadata (~50%) and unstructured difficult-to-organize data (~44%).

Historically slow-to-adopt technology the transportation industry has recently begun realizing the imperative and making up ground with 60% of an MHI and Deloitte poll respondents expecting to embrace AI in the next five years. Gartner predicts that by the end of 2024 75% of organizations will move from piloting to operationalizing AI driving a five times increase in streaming data and analytics infrastructures.

For many transportation management companies accessing cleansing and integrating the right data to maximize AI will be the first step. AI requires large volumes of detailed data and varied data sources to effectively identify models and develop learned behavior.

Review capabilities and consider getting help

Before jumping on the AI bandwagon too quickly companies should assess the quality of their data and current tech stacks to determine what intelligence capabilities are already embedded.

And when it comes to investing in newer technologies to pave the path toward digital transformation choose AI-driven solutions that do not require you to become a data scientist.

Everything from pregnancy tests to glucose strips to inkjet printers to genetic tests rely on microfluidics. This technology unbeknownst to many people is everywhere and critical to many of the things that make the modern world go round.

What are microfluidics?

Microfluidic systems are any device that process minuscule amounts of liquids. The fluids travel through channels thinner than a hair and tiny valves can turn the flow on and off. These channels are made of materials such as glass polymers paper or gels.

One way to move fluids is with a mechanical pump; another way is to use the surface charges of certain materials; and yet another is to use the so-called capillary action – more commonly known as wicking. Wicking is the process by which the energy stored within the liquid propels the liquid through narrow spaces.

At small scales fluids behave in unintuitive ways. Picture not the turbulent chaotic flow coming out of a garden hose or your showerhead. Instead in the constricted volumes of a microchannel flows are eerily stable.

Fluids move down the channel in organized parallel streams – called laminar flow. Laminar flow is one of the great wonders of microfluidic systems. The fluids and particles in laminar flow follow paths that are mathematically predictable – a necessity for precision engineering and medical device design.

These processes – inspiring to researchers – have existed in nature for eons. Plants transport nutrients from their roots up to the highest branches using capillarity the inspiration for microfluidic circuits that are autonomously powered.

Mimicking the physical properties of raindrops chemists have designed devices that break a sample into millions of droplets and analyze them at dizzying speeds. Each droplet is essentially a tiny chemical laboratory that allows chemists to study the evolution of biomolecules and perform ultra-fast genetic analysis among other things.

And finally every corner of the human body is microfluidic. We could not be born or function without intricate blood capillaries that bring food oxygen and signaling molecules to every cell.

The benefits of tiny tech

Much like microelectronics size is key in microfluidics.

As the components get smaller devices can rely on the strange properties of liquids at tiny scales can operate faster and more efficiently and are cheaper to manufacture. The microfluidics revolution has been silently piggybacking on its electronic counterpart.

Another major benefit of microfluidic devices is that they require only very small amounts of liquid and therefore can be tiny in size.

NASA has been considering microfluidic analyzers for its Mars rovers for a long time. The analysis of precious fluids – such as human blood – also benefits from the ability to use small samples. For example glucose meters are microfluidic instruments that require only a drop of blood to measure a diabetic's blood sugar.

Microfluidics in tech biology and medicine

Chances are that you use microfluidics quite often in your life. Inkjet printers shoot tiny ink droplets. 3D printers squeeze out molten polymer through a microfluidic nozzle. The ink in fountain pens and ballpoint pens flows via microfluidic principles. Nebulizers for asthma patients spray a mist of microscopic drug droplets. A pregnancy test relies on urine flow within a microfluidic paper strip.

In scientific research microfluidics can direct drugs nutrients or any fluid to very specific parts of organisms to more precisely simulate biological processes.

For example researchers have trapped worms in channels and stimulated them with odors to learn about neural circuits. Another team directed nutrients toward specific areas of a plant root to observe different reactions to growth chemicals.

Other groups have devised microfluidic traps that physically capture rare tumor cells from blood.

Multitudes of microfluidic genetic chips provide the power to rapidly sequence the human genome and make personalized DNA tests such as 23andMe a reality. None of this would have been possible without microfluidics.

The future of microfluidics

Microfluidics will be critical for ushering medicine into a new fast-paced affordable era. Wearable devices that measure substances in sweat for exercise monitoring and implantable devices that locally deliver cancer drugs to a patient's tumor are some of the next frontiers of biomedical microfluidics.

Researchers are developing complex fascinating microfluidic systems called organs-on-a-chip that aim to simulate various aspects of human physiology.

In my own lab and other labs across the world teams are developing tumor-on-a-chip platforms to test cancer drugs more efficiently. These patient avatars will enable scientists to test new treatments in a way that does not entail the cost suffering and ethical issues associated with testing in animals or in humans.

In my lab we first dissect a tumor biopsy from a cancer patient into thousands of microscopic regular pieces that we keep alive. By virtue of their small size we can use microfluidics to trap the tiny tumor pieces in multiple wells one well per drug.

These samples retain the appropriate cellular environment of the tumor which will allow us to more accurately predict how a drug will work for a specific person.

Imagine going to the doctor getting a biopsy extracted and in less than a week by using our microfluidic device the doctor can figure out which drug cocktail works best to remove your tumor. That is still in the future but what we do know is that the future will be microfluidic.

The DDR5 memory technology is landing in Q3 2021 for next-generation gaming and mainstream PC platforms.

Corsair's DDR5 Memory Kits & Memory Modules Up To 6400 MHz Teased

Corsair states that the company has had a great run with its existing Dominator and Vengeance line of DDR4 memory kits and now they are moving ahead in offering the same quality in DDR5 series. According to the company DDR5-6400 memory will offer up to 51 GB/s of bandwidth which is double the bandwidth of DDR4 memory and also at far better efficiency. It is also stated that the memory capacities will hit a whopping 128 GB on a single memory module.

2 of 9

Corsair doesn't state explicitly which memory kits it would launch under the next generation but we can definitely expect a brand new Dominator line. As for the launch of DDR5 memory Corsair states that the memory is launching soon and that they will be sharing more information on the memory technology & its respective products in the coming months.

There will also be faster memory modules in the future with other manufacturers reporting speeds of over 10000 MHz in the research phase. We are expected to get 32 64 and up to 128 GB memory capacities this year with speeds between 4800 MHz and 5600 MHz. TeamGroup previously reported that the voltages on DDR5 memory can be pushed up to 2.6V with LN2 cooling.

DDR5 memory is expected to bring over twice the performance increase over DDR4 as seen in the previously leaked benchmarks. We have already seen DDR4 hitting speeds of over 7 GHz with OC so 10 GHz doesn't sound like a big deal for the next-gen memory as SK Hynix & Micron deliver faster DRAM chips to vendors which are currently supplying to memory makers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A law firm hired by the board began an investigation in 2019 after a Microsoft engineer alleged in a letter she had a years-long sexual relationship with Gates people described as familiar with the matter told the Journal. During the process some board members concluded that it was inappropriate for Gates to remain on the board of the company he co-founded and led for decades and Gates resigned before the board's investigation was completed the Journal reported.

Microsoft confirmed an investigation into the matter was conducted.

""Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000"" a Microsoft representative said in a statement. ""A committee of the Board reviewed the concern aided by an outside law firm to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.""

Gates couldn't immediately be reached for comment but a spokeswoman for the Microsoft co-founder confirmed to the Journal the existence of ""an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably."" She went on to say that the ""decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.""

Gates resigned from the Microsoft board on March 13 2020 according to a press release at the time to ""dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities including global health development education and his increasing engagement in tackling climate change.""

Gates and his wife Melinda Gates announced earlier this month that they were ending their marriage after 27 years. In a joint statement posted on Twitter the couple said ""We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives."" In a divorce petition Melinda Gates described their marriage as ""irretrievably broken.""

The Wall Street Journal reported May 9 that Melinda Gates had been meeting with lawyers since 2019 as she planned for the divorce. The paper reported that earlier revelations that Bill Gates had spent time with Jeffrey Epstein the convicted sex trafficker were at least partly behind her decision. Apparently Melinda Gates had worried about Epstein's relationship with her husband. The New York Times reported in October 2019 that Bill Gates had met with Epstein ""many times"" since 2011. Bill Gates has denied any business relationship or friendship with Epstein.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZGVsbC14cHMtMTMtdnMtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGFwdG9wLTQtd2hpY2gtMTMtaW5jaC1sYXB0b3AtaXMtYmVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dell XPS 13 vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 4: Which 13-inch laptop is best?,"The Dell XPS 13 has proven to be a top-notch portable laptop with every iteration and the current model is no exception. Thanks to the power of Intel’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake processor the XPS 13 offers excellent performance over 11 hours of battery life and the ability to run some AAA titles on low settings.

The Surface Laptop 4 we reviewed was of a similar but cooler hue with an arctic tint that Microsoft calls Ice Blue. Lift the lid and bask in the smooth and stain-resistant Alcantara fabric that makes up the keyboard deck. And if you don’t like this feature buyers can opt in for an all-aluminum chassis by selecting the Sandstone or Matte Black colors. Unfortunately the Surface Laptop 4’s thick bezels are ugly and distracting.

Both the XPS 13 (11.6 x 7.8 x 0.6-inch) and Surface Laptop 4 (12.1 x 8.8 x 0.6 inches) come in at 2.8 pounds although the latter laptop is wider and taller.

Winner: XPS 13

Ports

The XPS 13 has a Thunderbolt 4 port on both the left and right side. Beyond this it’s lacking in ports  as it boasts only an audio jack on the right and microSD card slot on the left. The lack of a USB-A port will prove to be inconvenient for many users although Dell included a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter with the laptop.

The Surface Laptop 4 is similarly lacking in ports as its left side has a USB 3.1 Type-A port a USB 3.1 Type-C port without Thunderbolt support and an audio jack. On the right there’s a magnetic charging and docking Surface Connect port.

Winner: XPS 13

Display

The first thing you’ll notice when you lift the XPS 13’s lid is its almost bezel-less display . Not only is this 13.4-inch 1920 x 1200-pixel touchscreen bright but it keeps the focus on what’s happening on screen. Dell even managed to fit a webcam above the display this time. On the other hand the Surface Laptop 4’s 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504-pixel IPS touchscreen display allows for colors to pop even more than they do on the XPS 13. Business users will also appreciate the 3:2 aspect ratio although the XPS 13 also uses a non-traditional 16:10. However it suffers from thick bezels that distract from what’s important.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The XPS 13 averaged 469 nits of brightness which is significantly better than the premium laptop average (392 nits) and the Surface Laptop 4 (349 nits). However the XPS 13 measured only 69.4% of the DCI-P3 color gamut . This is less colorful than the Microsoft Surface Laptop’s 77% and nowhere near the 85% premium laptop average.

Winner: Draw.

Keyboard and Touchpad

Both the XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4 ensure that as much space as possible is dedicated to the keyboard. Dell even managed to increase the size of the keys by 9% with the latest XPS 13. These island-style keys are firm bouncy and comfortably spaced. The Surface Laptop 4’s keyboard is also springy which makes typing feel effortless and the keys are big enough to fit most hands.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

The XPS 13’s 2.5 x 4.4-inch glass touchpad feels smooth to use with a quick and agile responsiveness. You can perform gestures and swap between pages without lag. The Surface Laptop 4’s 4.5 x 3-inch touchpad surface feels silky and responsive performing gestures smoothly with a satisfying click from the bottom left or right corners.

Both laptops do a good job in this round however the Surface Laptop 4 has a more comfortable keyboard and larger touchpad.

Winner: Surface Laptop 4

Performance

Paired with 16GB of RAM and powered by Intel’s Tiger Lake processors both the XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4 boast quick performance while running intensive tasks. Our XPS 13 review unit had a 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-1165G7 CPU and easily ran 30 tabs at once consisting of YouTube videos Twitch streams and Twitter pages. The Surface Laptop 4 review had an Intel Core i7-1185G7 CPU with 16GB of RAM and was equally as competent handling just as many tabs.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

On the Geekbench 5.4 overall performance benchmark the Surface Laptop 4 scored a 4829 falling short of the XPS 13 (5319). Even then both laptops exceed the 4368 premium laptop average.

On the other hand the Surface Laptop 4 did better on the Handbrake test taking 17 minutes and 1 second to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution. The XPS 13 took 18 minutes and 22 seconds but neither were faster than the 16:17 category average.

The XPS 13 excelled when duplicating 25GB of multimedia files managing a speed of 729.3 megabytes per second. This is faster than both the Surface Laptop 4 (562.7 MBps) and the category average (630.5 MBps). We'll give the XPS 13 the win for its speedier SSD.

Winner: XPS 13

Battery Life

Intel’s Tiger Lake processors have contributed in greatly improving battery life which is especially evident with the XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4. Tested under the Laptop Mag Battery Test  both lasted longer than the 10 hour and 19 minute premium laptop average. The XPS 13 managed 11:07 before powering down while the Surface Laptop 4 clocked in at 10:46.

The Surface Laptop 4 is a great choice but the XPS 13 managed to pull ahead in nearly every category. Although many of these races were close the XPS 13 dominated in the end with its long battery life faster SSD bright display and sleek design. And thanks to its almost bezel-less screen you can focus on what matters. Dell improved upon an already excellent laptop with this latest model.

However the Surface Laptop 4 does pull ahead in a few ways; it boasts a more colorful display the keyboard is more comfortable and it converts videos from 4K to 1080p faster than the XPS 13. And even though it has been overshadowed by the XPS 13 it still possesses a powerful processor solid battery life and competitive pricing. We recommend the XPS 13 over the Surface Laptop 4 but you can't go wrong with either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvY2twYXBlcnNob3RndW4uY29tL3RoaXMtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3ItZHJpdmluZy1tb2QtbG9va3MtanVzdC1nb29kLWVub3VnaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Microsoft Flight Simulator driving mod looks just good enough,"Mod communities tend to follow predictable arcs so it's often possible to predict what work users will create long before it exists. For that reason I thought to myself today: Microsoft Flight Simulator has been out for a while I wonder if anyone has made a mod that lets you drive a car around its world yet.

There's no video of it by its maker MrFace so here's YouTuber AviationSimulation driving around various locales for an hour with (I think) no narration:

As I say in the headline: it looks just good enough. Juuuuuuust. Flight Simulator's recreation of planet earth is astonishing and gets better with each update but it's designed to be viewed from thousands of feet in the sky. Buildings and vistas still look pretty good from ground level but you quickly spot the errors in its tree placements and the blurriness of its ground textures. There's also only limited collision meaning you'll crash into buildings but can drive through cars and trees. Don't expect Forza is what I'm saying.

But for me it looks good enough that I'm considering re-downloading all two billion gigabytes of the game. I'm always interested in seeing a game world from a new perspective and I've always loved driving games that recreate real places. How could you not want to drive around all the Flight Sim cities created from photogrammetry?

What I would really like of course is for Flight Simulator's developers Asobo to do this themselves. They previously made Fuel a late-00's racing game which took place in a miniature post-apocalyptic United States which was partly created from satellite data and I am ready and waiting for a Fuel 2 which uses Flight Sim's vastly improved aerial scans for something similar.

That will probably never happen but you can download the MSFS driving mod by MrFace here and we provided instructions on how to install them alongside our picks for the best Microsoft Flight Simulator mods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzI0ODk1L2hvdy10by1jbG9zZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbXMtY29tcGxldGVseS13aGVuLXlvdS1jbG9zZS10aGUtYXBwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Close Microsoft Teams Completely When You Close the App,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzI0ODk1L2hvdy10by1jbG9zZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbXMtY29tcGxldGVseS13aGVuLXlvdS1jbG9zZS10aGUtYXBwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2JpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWhhZC1hZmZhaXItd2l0aC1taWNyb3NvZnQtZW1wbG95ZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Gates had lengthy affair with Microsoft employee who wanted his wife to know: report,"Bill Gates allegedly had an affair with a Microsoft employee — and the tryst was being probed by the company’s board last year when Gates stepped down a report said Sunday.

The company’s board became aware in 2019 that a Microsoft engineer penned a letter alleging that she and Gates had a sexual relationship over the years the Wall Street Journal reported.

The woman demanded changes to her Microsoft job and also asked that Gates’ now-estranged wife Melinda read her letter — though it’s unclear if that happened.

Board members hired a law firm to conduct an investigation into the relationship the Journal said.

During the probe some members grew concerned about the allegation and decided that Gates who founded the tech firm in 1975 should step down as director of the board.

But the billionaire was still re-elected to Microsoft’s board at the annual shareholder meeting the report said. He resigned before the investigation could be completed saying he wanted to focus on his philanthropy.

“Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000” a Microsoft spokesman said.

“A committee of the Board reviewed the concern aided by an outside law firm to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.”

A spokeswoman for Gates admitted “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably.”

She denied that his decision to step down from the board was related to the affair adding “In fact he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.”

Microsoft came under fire in April 2019 after Quartz reported on an email chain within the company where female employees shared stories of sexual harassment and discrimination.

After the report chief executive Satya Nadella announced that the company would change its process for handling employee complaints of harassment and discrimination.

Nadella and other top executives were aware of the woman’s allegations about having a relationship with Gates according to the Journal. Gates still serves as a technical adviser to Nadella.

The Journal’s report comes after another on Sunday detailed how Gates “pursued” several women in his office long after he wed now-estranged wife Melinda in 1994.

The New York Times reported two instances when the tech mogul clumsily asked out women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The two incidents and other more recent ones at times created an uncomfortable workplace environment with Gates’ personal life becoming gossip fodder among employees six current and former staffers told the newspaper.

It’s unclear how much Melinda knew about her husband’s behavior.

The couple said they were ending their 27-year marriage earlier this month saying “We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.” In a divorce petition Melinda said their marriage was “irretrievably broken.”

She reportedly hired divorce attorneys in 2019 after her husband’s ties to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were made public setting in motion the couple’s divorce announcement."

The team – from Gladstone Institute of Virology in San Francisco and the University of California – also provided evidence that individuals who receive one vaccine dose after having recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection may not require a second dose.

Furthermore Nadia Roan and colleagues showed that in previously infected individuals vaccination might induce more persistent homing of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to the respiratory tract than in previously uninfected individuals.

“We find a reassuringly unaltered T cell response against the variants and a striking impact of prior infection on qualitative features of T cells elicited by vaccination” writes the team.

A pre-print version of the research paper is available on the bioRxiv* server while the article undergoes peer review.

This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication.

Concerns about vaccine efficacy against variants

Since the COVID-19 outbreak first began in late December 2019 intense efforts to develop and clinically test vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 quickly resulted in the emergency use authorization of several mRNA-based vaccines.

Although the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have proved highly effective at protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection concerns have arisen regarding the extent to which they can protect against the new variants that are now quickly spreading across the globe.

The antibodies generated following vaccination generally remain as potent against the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the UK as they are against the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. However studies have also shown the antibodies to be less effective against the B.1.351 lineage that emerged in South Africa and the P.1 variant that emerged in Brazil.

It is also not clear how booster doses and prior infection might influence the vaccine-elicited immunity.

T cell-mediated immunity seems to be less prone to evasion

Reassuringly early studies have suggested that T cell-mediated immunity appears to be less prone to evasion by the variants.

“The relative resistance of T cells against SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion is important in light of the critical role these immune effectors play during COVID-19” says Roan and colleagues. “T cell numbers display a strong inverse association with disease severity and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predicts recovery from severe disease.”

T cells may also be the key to long-term immune memory due to their ability to persist for decades adds the team.

Furthermore studies of the antibody and B cell response to infection suggest that for COVID-19 convalescents one dose of an mRNA vaccine is beneficial but that a second booster jab is not necessary.

However “how this translates in the context of vaccine-elicited T cell immunity is not clear” says Roan and colleagues.

What did the researchers do?

The team conducted a longitudinal study of eight mRNA-vaccinated individuals four of whom had recovered from COVID-19 and four of whom were infection-naïve. The researchers conducted a T-cell centric CyTOF (cytometry by time-of-flight) analysis to phenotype participants’ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells.

Three of the participants had received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and the remaining five had received the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine.

For each of the 24 samples obtained the researchers assessed phenotype and effector function of T cells responding to the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the spikes of the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants.

The spike protein is the main structure the virus uses to infect host cells and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies following vaccination.

What did they find?

Vaccination-elicited T cells responded similarly to spike epitopes from the ancestral strain and the variants. The phenotypic features of these cells were identical across the different strains.

“That both the quantity and quality of T cell responses is maintained against the variants may provide an explanation for the real-world efficacy of the vaccines against variants” says the team.

Among the infection-naïve individuals a second dose boosted the quantity although not the quality of the spike-specific responses.

The researchers say this highlights the importance of ensuring a second dose is administered to infection-naïve individuals.

Among the convalescent participants however there was again no evidence of phenotypic changes in the spike-specific T cells following a second dose but there was also no evidence of boosted T cell numbers.

“Our results suggest that a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may provide less benefit than in individuals who have not previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2” says Roen and colleagues.

Differences in phenotypes between convalescent versus infection-naïve vaccinees

The researchers say that one of the most striking findings was the remarkably distinct phenotypes of the spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees versus infection-naïve vaccinees.

The spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent individuals exhibited features indicating the increased potential for long-term persistence including the elevated expression of CD127 – a marker of long-lived memory T cells.

Compared with infection-naïve vaccinees CD4+ T cells from the nasopharynx of the upper respiratory tract in convalescent individuals also expressed multiple tissue-homing receptors.

What are the implications of the study?

“All together these results imply that compared to infection-naïve individuals convalescents’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells may be superior in surviving and migrating to the respiratory tract” write the researchers.

Referring to the findings overall the team says “these results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2- specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.”

The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government has amended its global tender for COVID-19 vaccines issued last week to make the vaccine storage conditions flexible. The amendment has made companies like Pfizer and Moderna eligible to place bids.

The state has also introduced a new provision in its tender saying companies applying from neighbouring countries (like China) would first need the Centre’s nod.

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

In the initial tender issued on May 7 for 40 million vaccine doses the UP government had said that the vaccine to be supplied should be able to be stored between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. This effectively put MNRA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna out of the race as they require much lower storage temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius and minus 20 degrees Celsius respectively. Pfizer however still attended UP’s pre-bid tender meeting on May 12 along with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Serum Institute Bharat Biotech Zydus and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories which is going to manufacture Sputnik. Most of the other vaccines can be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.

“The COVID vaccine other than temperature range requirement (2-8 degree celsius) may also be accepted subject to fulfillment of all other terms and conditions mentioned in the bid. For vaccine which requires storage transportation and temperature range other than above (2-8 degrees) like -20 degree/ -70 degree/ -80 degree seller has to advise and facilitate the transportation up to consignee place and safe storage at consignee store till the time vaccine is dispatched from consignee store to ultimate destination (vaccine administration place)” the amended tender says.

The UP government has storage facility for temperature range 2-8 degrees (in the form of walk-in cooler ice-lined refrigerator) and “limited capacity of minus 20 degrees storage (in the form of deep freezer)” it says.

The state government’s original tender had said a bidder may have the nationality of any country thereby not barring Chinese manufacturers. That has now been amended through a corrigendum. “Any bidder from a country which shares a land border with India will be eligible to bid in any procurement whether of goods services or works only if the bidder is registered with Competent Authority” the new stipulation added to the tender says.

Compliance with an order issued by the Ministry of Finance on July 23 2020 has been made mandatory under which restrictions were placed on bidders from countries sharing a land border with India and only those registered by a committee under the Department for Promotion of Industrial and Internal Trade (DPIIT) would be allowed to participate in bids.

Global tenders issued by the Uttarakhand government and Mumbai’s civic body for vaccines had specifically barred companies from neighbouring countries. Among the other changes introduced by UP in its tender is to halve the earnest money deposit from Rs 160 million to Rs 80 million.",,,,,,

Their new collaboration in Indonesia will create the world’s single largest sustainable commercial cocoa farm: 2000-hectare cocoa farm on Seram the largest island in Maluku province in Indonesia.

The Mondelēz International and Olam Food Ingredients joint venture

The project will use advanced climate smart and plant science technology and the model tests a modernised and professional blueprint for best practice cocoa farming optimal land usage and farming community planning which will be explored as a potential model for replication across the region.

The partnership aims to deliver:

The creation of 700 jobs for local residents in an area which has limited income opportunities due to its isolated location. Nearly half of these employment opportunities will go to women.

2000 hectares of previously deforested brown field land which will be planted with cocoa shade trees forest and fruit trees to promote biodiversity and carbon capture. More than 1080 hectares have already been planted across the total plantation area of 3380 hectares.

An area of 47 hectares which has been identified as High Conservation Value forest and is being fully protected as a vital habitat for flora and fauna.

A seedling nursery which can grow up to one million high-yielding cocoa seedlings each year.

Access to healthcare and education for all employees and their families as well as housing electricity water day care for the 200 families who live on site.

Cocoa’s popularity increases in Asia

Demand for cocoa is growing across Asia which is set to become the second largest consuming region of cocoa ingredients in the world. Indonesia is a key cocoa-producing country in the region but farmers have struggled with rising temperatures low yields and crop disease.

Combining their respective expertise in cocoa growing research and development sustainable cocoa farm management and good agricultural practices Mondelēz International and Olam will tackle these problems by improving the livelihoods of partner cocoa farmers empowering communities and restoring the environmental productivity of a previously deforested landscape.

“As one of the world’s leading chocolate makers we’re on a mission to make cocoa right and to secure a sustainable future for an ingredient essential to our business” said Quentin Roach SVP Supply Chain & Chief Procurement Officer Mondelēz International. “With nine years of measurable impact demonstrating improved farmer’s livelihoods and reduced environmental impact of cocoa farming through our signature sustainable sourcing program Cocoa Life we’re excited to leverage our know-how in a collaborative approach to sustainable raw material sourcing with a geographically customised solution.”

“This could be truly game-changing for the future of cocoa in Indonesia and beyond” said Gerard A. Manley CEO of Olam Food Ingredients’s Cocoa Business. “Ever since we launched our first sustainability program in the country more than 16 years ago we have been committed to supporting Indonesian cocoa farmers while also protecting the environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25mZWN0aW9uZXJ5cHJvZHVjdGlvbi5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS8zNTA0Ny9tb25kZWxlei1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlbGVhc2VzLWl0cy0yMDIwLXNuYWNraW5nLW1hZGUtcmlnaHQtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mondelēz International releases its 2020 Snacking Made Right sustainability report,"Delivering on sustainability targets has become increasingly significant for many key businesses within the cocoa and confectionery sector including Mondelēz International which has just released its latest Snacking Made Right 2020 report on its core areas of progress. Neill Barston examines its results

Mondelēz International’s Snacking Made Right Report has revealed key details of its achievements against its ESG targets (environmental social and governance) including making gains on sustainable sourcing water efficiency and reduced waste across its global operations.

As the company which is behind Cadbury Oreo Milka chocolate Toblerone and Belvita acknowledged it has set itself ambitious targets for 2025 which it stated have focused on areas of the business that it believes can drive the most significant potential change.

Following on from its last review in 2019 which came in response to ongoing health concerns surrounding obesity and health of consumers as well as commercial impact of its global activities the company has continues a positive pattern of improvement against its targets.

Perhaps key among them is the confirmation that 68% of cocoa volume is now sourced sustainably via its signature sourcing program Cocoa Life (an improvement of 5% in the past year) as well as 98% palm oil sourced from suppliers aligned to MDLZ’s 2020 Palm Oil Action Plan.

Significantly it has attained a 20+% reduction in CO2 from manufacturing exceeding the target of 15% which remains an ongoing process for the business and another prime area of focus for the firm.

As the company noted its approach to ESG enables it to build a sustainable snacking company and deliver lasting change at scale by prioritising where it can have the greatest impact focusing on innovative and measurable solutions and collaborating to drive sector-wide transformation.

ESG is one of Mondelēz International’s long-term value drivers is integrated throughout the business strategy and is core to its purpose – to empower people to snack right by delivering the right snack at the right moment made the right way.

“Snacking Made Right is part of everything we do at Mondelēz International. It drives us to take care of our people to protect our resources and provide moments of comfort and connection for our consumers around the world” said Dirk Van de Put Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International.

“Last year our purpose was more important than ever and pushed us to continue to advance our ESG commitments and expand our robust goals. We remain focused on building a sustainable snacking company minimising our impact on the environment while being a more diverse equitable inclusive and transparent organisation and we are dedicated to accelerating our efforts to lead the future of snacking.”

The company added that its continuous efforts to deliver positive change have led to what it considered as being significant business-impacting results such as enhanced sustainable sourcing programmes significant emissions and waste reductions and stronger connections with consumers and customers.

During the past year the company made meaningful progress against its sustainability and well-being goals and exceeded multiple targets.

In addition to its sourcing and waste reduction it has also achieved 30+% reduction in priority water usage exceeding the target of 10% 30+% reduction in total waste from manufacturing exceeding the target of 20% as well as 94% of its packaging designed to be recyclable.

Regarding wellbeing a total of 16% of its revenues are now from portion controlled snacks – which remains the company’s key means of addressing obesity rather than offering specifically sugar-reduced confectionery (with notable exceptions including the 30% less sugar Cadbury Dairy Milk bars.

The company has also established its Sustainable Futures platform to amplify long-term positive impact for people and the planet through innovative social investment and partnerships. It has delivered more than $30 million globally for COVID-19 relief efforts including a recent $2 million donation to support India’s fight against the pandemic.

Furthermore the US-headquartered business said it is stepping up its commitments to diversity equity & inclusion and enhancing disclosure around progress in this space.

In 2020 the company announced robust commitments including spending $1 billion with women- and minority-owned businesses annually and doubling U.S. Black representation in management by 2024 while also appointing its first Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer. For the first time this year it also publishes its EEO-1 consolidated and full filings while continuing to adopt and publish annual SASB & TCFD alignment indices as part of an ongoing commitment to expanded disclosure and transparency.

2025 environmental goals

Moreover the Snacking Made Right report also reaffirms the company’s 2025 environmental goals including:

· Cocoa – 100% of cocoa volume for chocolate brands sourced through MDLZ’s signature sustainable sourcing program Cocoa Life

Carbon -10% reduction in science-based end-to-end C02 emissions

· Packaging 100% of packaging designed to be recyclable and labeled with recycling information and 25% reduction in the use of virgin rigid plastic

“We have a clear and distinctive approach to sustainability one that is aligned to our business strategy and informed by our understanding of the issues that are most material to us as a business” said Christine Montenegro McGrath Vice President and Chief of Global Impact and Sustainability at Mondelēz International.

“Moving forward we will continue to target our efforts prioritising where we can have the greatest impact tackling root causes measuring our progress and investing in scalable solutions while remaining flexible and open to new ideas so we can drive lasting and meaningful change at scale.” For more information on the company’s progress the report can be read in full here.

Hanon System's battery-powered heater

The sale process of a near-70% stake in South Korean auto parts supplier Hanon Systems Corp. has kicked off attracting a pool of strategic investors and global private equity firms such as KKR Carlyle and TPG. The deal is expected to fetch around 7 trillion won ($6.2 billion) making it the largest acquisition in Korea's M&A history.According to the investment banking industry on May 14 joint sale managers Morgan Stanley and Evercore recently issued an information memorandum to potential bidders with preliminary bidding slated for mid-June.The Hanon stake for sale is in the 69.9% range including the 50.5% stake held by its largest shareholder Hahn & Co . and the 19.49% stake held by its second-largest shareholder Hankook Tire & Technology Co. which will be exercising its tag-along rights or ""co-sales"" rights meaning both companies can re-sell the purchased stake simultaneously.The two firms had acquired their combined stake in Hanon from Visteon Corp. a US automotive electronics supplier for 3.8 trillion won in 2014.Based on Hankook Tire's tag-along rights a partial stake will be sold at a ratio of 5:2. For example if a 40% stake in Hanon is sold then Hahn & Co and Hankook Tire will sell a 28% and 12% stake respectively.Hanon manufactures and sells a wide range of products including air conditioners heaters cooling modules and compressors. The company is the world's No. 2 thermal management systems supplier for automakers In electric vehicle era superior thermal management systems are essential to regulate energy efficiency. The growing EV market is expected to increase demand for Hanon's battery thermal management systems.Hanon's high-profile client portfolio is another attractive factor. Its clients include Korea's leading automakers Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp. alongside global auto firms such as Ford Volkswagen GM and Tesla.Global auto parts suppliers looking to offset plummeting diesel car demand are likely to take interest in the Hanon deal which is why the world’s fifth-largest auto parts supplier Continental Automotive has been named a potential bidder.Also the country's fourth-largest conglomerate LG Electronics Inc. is expected to join the bid. The company has identified the EV auto parts industry as a main growth driver after exiting from its loss-making mobile phone business . Last year LG Electronics entered a $1 billion joint venture with Magna International Inc. to develop EV components and boost its footing in the EV market.It is understood that Carlyle has approached LG Electronics to set up a consortium which would make it the most competitive bidder. Meanwhile KKR recently closed its $15 billion Asian fund IV securing enough capital to acquire Hanon.Korea's Halla Group may also consider acquiring a partial stake by joining forces with other PE firms or strategic investors.The biggest hurdle will be the high price. The company’s market capitalization last Friday (May 14) stood near 8.6 trillion won valuing its 70% stake at around 6 trillion won. The price could even reach between 7 trillion won to 8 trillion won including the management premium according to the investment banking industry.If competition heats up Hanon's majority stake sale is likely to become the largest deal in Korea's M&A history topping PE firm MBK Partners' 7.2 trillion won acquisition of retail chain Homeplus in 2015.But the outlook isn't so rosy.“The industry frontrunner Denso's price to earnings ratio stands at 15 times but we have to justify Hanon's PE ratio of 27 times at the global investment committee. There isn't a proper logic which is raising concerns” said a PE firm official who is considering joining the bid.Another M&A industry official pointed out that the deal would've drawn a larger pool of bidders if it was priced lower in the 3 trillion won range considering there aren't many firms that can consider purchasing a stake worth 6 trillion won.Also the company's earnings outlook for this year doesn't look too bright given the recent automobile chip shortage and shipping delays. Hanon's target EBITDA of 1 trillion won was pushed back last year due to the COVID-19 crisis and if the company fails to achieve it this year it could create doubt among buyers.Jun-ho Cha at chacha@hankyung.com Danbee Lee edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xsYW5kc2VudGluZWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9tb3RpdmUvMjAyMS8wNS8xNi9jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLWdvZXMtb24tY2Fycy1zY2FyY2UtYW5kLXByaWNlcy11cC81MDg5MTg1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As chip shortage goes on cars are scarce and prices are up,"Tom Krisher

AP Auto Writer

DETROIT — For the next few months Charlie Gilchrist figures his 11 car dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area will sell just about every new vehicle they can get from the factories — and at increased prices.

In normal times that would be cause for joy. Not so much now. A global shortage of computer chips has forced automakers to slash production. The result has been far fewer vehicles on dealer lots just as the waning pandemic has fueled a pent-up consumer demand for cars trucks and SUVs.

Given the robust customer demand dealers like Gilchrist could sell many more cars and trucks if only they had more. Even at elevated prices — the average new-vehicle sales price tops $40000 up nearly 10% in two years — customer demand exceeds supply.

""It's pretty evident when you pull onto our lots that there's not much selection"" said Gilchrist whose lots carry brands ranging from General Motors and Ford to Nissan and Volkswagen. ""Our (sales) volume is falling because of the sheer lack of inventory. It will still fall during the next two or three months.""

The across-the-board surge in auto prices contributed mightily to last month's jump in U.S. consumer prices the government reported Wednesday. A record 10% increase in used vehicle prices in fact accounted for roughly one-third of April's overall rise in consumer prices — the sharpest monthly increase in more than a decade.

Ford expects to produce only half its normal number of vehicles from now through June. GM and others have resorted to halting production of some cars and smaller SUVs and diverting computer chips to higher-profit pickup trucks and large SUVs. Leading automakers are warning of diminished earnings.

The vehicle scarcity and the soaring prices can be traced to the eruption of the coronavirus 14 months ago. As the virus spread auto factories shut down for a couple of months. With millions more people working from home demand for laptops and monitors led semiconductor makers to shift from autos to personal electronics. Soon though a faster-than-expected economic rebound boosted demand for vehicles and auto plants tried to restore full-scale production. Yet chip makers couldn't respond swiftly enough.

With production slowed dealer inventories shrank. Now as the chip shortage has persisted the shortage of new vehicles has worsened and analysts foresee no return to normal before next year.

Yet so far automakers have been earning big profits even with a depleted inventory largely because many buyers have been willing to pay more to get what they want. With government stimulus checks and tax refunds in hand Americans bought about 1.5 million new vehicles in April. That's an adjusted annual sales rate of 18.5 million — the highest such rate since 2005.

""It's like toilet paper was a year ago"" said Michelle Krebs executive analyst for Cox Automotive. ""Everyone is rushing to buy a car.""

Cox Automotive surveys suggest that 63% of potential buyers will stay in the market even with higher prices and a meager selection of vehicles. With new vehicles prices jumping the cost of popular vehicles has become eye-opening. The average price of a new Chevrolet Silverado pickup for example is now just under $51000.

Even so the supply of vehicles is dwindling. Last month the nation's total new-vehicle inventory plummeted 42% from a year ago to 1.9 million. That's enough to supply only 33 days of sales at the current pace — 88 days fewer than a year ago according to Cox. At the same time discounts fell 5% from March to April and 25% from a year ago to an average of $3239 per vehicle.

Jeremy Smith is seeing the price increases on both ends as he buys and sells pickup trucks for his utility trailer sales business near Buffalo New York. In March he bought a used diesel 2020 Chevy Silverado crew cab with 21000 miles on for $61000. Comparable trucks are now listed on websites he said for $68000 to $70000.

At the same time he's asking $13995 for a 2011 Silverado crew cab with 178000 miles on it a far higher price than he would have thought even a few months ago.

""You sell high you buy high"" said Smith who frequently buys trucks for his business. To get one now he says people have to move quickly to put in bids with dealers or owners.

""If you're not on it"" he said ""those things are gone.""

Given the lack of supply nearly everyone expects new vehicle sales to fall soon. That would mean fewer trade-ins which would further tighten a low supply of used vehicles. For consumers who can wait analysts say it might be wise to delay buying any vehicle until next year or even beyond.

An index that measures wholesale U.S. used vehicle prices from auction house Manheim soared 53% in April from a year ago hitting a record high. Auto dealers buy used vehicles at auctions; the average price there hit nearly $18000.

Dealers mark up wholesale prices when they sell to consumers. The average list price of a used car last month was just over $22000 14% higher than a year ago.

Dealers are now scrambling for used cars hoping to sell them to keep cash flowing through the summer as new vehicle supplies dry up. Richard Bazzy who runs four Ford and Lincoln dealerships in suburban Pittsburgh said he's formed a team to buy used vehicles.

""Every car dealer in the world is jamming the auctions right now trying to fill their shelves because of the lack of new-car inventory"" he said.

Bazzy said he's hopeful that his business will manage OK with used sales as well as revenue from parts and service. But he wants all the used cars they acquire now to be sold by August when he expects the inventory of vehicles to start a return to normal.

Cox's Krebs said it's hard to predict how long the chip shortage and tight supplies will last. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cautioned investors not to expect extremely high auto prices beyond the end of this year as new-vehicle supplies recover.

The pandemic and chip shortage have made rental cars scarcer too driving up prices dramatically and causing long waits as people start traveling again. Rental companies have had trouble getting new cars because auto companies have diverted vehicles away from fleet buyers to more profitable sales to consumers. Higher demand has sent some rental companies to the used car market to find vehicles.

Whenever the car shortage ends GM Ford and others say they will change business models away from having huge stocks. GM has considered regional distribution centers that could send vehicles to dealers in a matter of days. Ford's CEO Jim Farley has talked of quickly delivering on factory orders. Both companies hope to reduce the interest paid on high inventories and keep discounts low.

""I do think we are on the verge of possibly a different kind of paradigm for how vehicles are distributed"" Krebs said.

Still competition could thwart those plans once factories return to normal production.

Bazzy normally stocks 400-500 pickup trucks at his three Ford dealers but is down to around 100. He's confident that he can keep customers happy if they order a truck and can get it in four weeks. But he fears losing business to competing brands with a huge stock.

""If the guy across the street from me has 300 (trucks) and my guy has to wait four weeks"" Bazzy said ""I'm going to lose him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL25wdGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS90aGlyZC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXJhbmNoZXItd29ya3MtdG8tZW5zdXJlLWZ1dHVyZS1pbi1yYW5jaGluZy1mb3ItaGlzLXNvbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV81ODliZDg3NC1iNGY5LTExZWItYmRiNC1hN2M3MWViZmQ0NDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third-generation rancher works to ensure future in ranching for his sons,"On Sept. 11 2001 Rusty Kemp was about to be married before returning to his McPherson County ranching roots.

He knew the New York City buildings collapsing before his eyes on television. He had trained briefly in Morgan Stanley’s World Trade Center offices after picking up his University of Nebraska at Kearney agribusiness degree in 1998.

“It was kind of surreal to see those buildings get knocked down” by the terrorist-hijacked planes said Kemp who worked in Morgan Stanley’s Kearney office for three years.

He and his wife Rachael exchanged vows 11 days later. “We went on our honeymoon and we had the whole plane to ourselves after that Sept. 11 attack.”

Then they were off to their newly purchased spread in McPherson County where the 1980s farm crisis had prompted older ranchers to discourage a young Kemp from coming home as an adult after college.

Even so “I worked for ranchers through college” he said. “Just what I wanted to do.”

Grandfather Emerson “Tom” Kemp had gotten off a Union Pacific train at North Platte as a 15-year-old in 1936.

He slept that night at the 12th and Jeffers Street intersection then “caught a ride to Tryon the next morning” to join two brothers who arrived ahead of him from Indiana Rusty said.

Kemp met his future wife during his brief stint at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln before switching to UNK.

Rachael who also holds an agribusiness degree worked three years for the IBP Inc. beef plant in Lexington (now owned by Tyson Foods) while Rusty worked in Kearney.

“That’s why it doesn’t frighten us” Kemp said of their quest to organize Sustainable Beef LLC and build an 875-employee beef processing plant at North Platte.

Between owned and leased land the Kemps raise about 1600 Black Angus and Hereford cattle on 30000 acres northwest of Tryon west of Nebraska Highway 97 and south of the Hooker County line.

The couple’s home place lies 11 miles off the highway down a sometimes-graveled sometimes-dirt unfenced road where cows and calves think nothing of coming up to check out strange cars on the path.

Kemp enjoys 2020s technological connections to the outside world. He usually moves his cattle out as yearlings watching them head for feedlots and processing plants across the nation.

He and Rachael whose family farmed and raised cattle near Doniphan got into ranching together at a good time he said.

“We were lucky on the timing when we bought this” he said. “It was before the land prices really took off. So we were very fortunate on the timing buying land and buying cattle.”

Even so “we’ve had challenging years” alongside good ones. The 2012 drought hit Kemp hard he said though the “mad cow disease” scare of 2003 also was difficult.

“That was an Old Testament wrath-of-God-type drought” in 2012 he said. “We’ve got the (Ogallala) aquifer under here” but there was “just no forage.”

The Kemps’ two sons commute 50 miles to school in North Platte where 16-year-old Cash is a North Platte High School sophomore and Tucker 12 is a sixth-grader at McDaid Elementary School.

Cash has shown interest in becoming a fourth-generation Kemp rancher Rusty said. Like younger Sustainable Beef partner Trey Wasserburger he hopes a new North Platte packing plant will help improve those odds.

“The market is what it is and it provides opportunities as well as challenges” Kemp said. “But we’ve just seen so much consolidation in the packing industry. We just don’t feel like we have a real strong market for us.”

In addition to Tyson the current U.S. “Big Four” meatpackers consist of JBS USA Cargill Inc. and National Beef Packing Co.

Those four account for a combined 80% of the nation’s meat processing. But “they can’t stop and shut down for a year” to update their equipment and redesign their plants Kemp said.

“I’m not picking a fight with the Big Four. We need them” he said. “We need them to process all the cattle we have. But we just feel like there’s a niche we can operate in in North Platte.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb29rZmllbGQuY29tL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvaW5zaWdodHMvdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtemVyby1jYXJib24td29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transforming Businesses for a Zero-Carbon World | Brookfield,"Introduction

Climate change poses unprecedented risks to the global economy—and of course to all our livelihoods.

With the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) occurring this November in Glasgow some countries are ramping up their efforts to combat these risks. The U.K. the host country of COP26 announced a new pledge to reduce carbon1 emissions by 78% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Meanwhile the U.S. which rejoined the Paris climate accord this year pledged to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Lastly the German government in response to a ruling by the constitutional court that it was unfairly burdening the younger generation raised its target for reducing carbon emissions by 2030 from 55% to 65%. It also brought forward its net-zero target by five years—to 2045 from 2050.2

Governments have also been focusing on “green” budgets. The U.K.’s 10-point plan includes big new targets for offshore wind generation investment in low-carbon hydrogen production capacity and the introduction of a ban in 2030 on the sale of new petrol cars.3 And the Biden administration’s proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan includes funding for projects like electric vehicle charging stations and the expansion of transmission lines for wind and solar electricity.4

Carbon prices are another policy lever that governments can pull. They create incentives for decarbonization by incorporating the cost of greenhouse gas emissions into the price of goods and services. The result is that companies—and investors—will need to consider the future cost of carbon since it will lead to changes in the way they allocate capital.5 And carbon pricing has shown to be a powerful tool: Emissions from sectors covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System are estimated to have fallen by 21% from 2005 to 2020.6

While carbon prices are operational or in the planning stages in many jurisdictions around the world most of them price carbon at only $40 or less per ton.7 In Canada however the government is now legislating a steady increase in the carbon tax such that it reaches C$170 per ton by 2030 from the federal price of C$40 per ton today.8 Overall governments are making progress but they still have a long way to go."

At road.cc we admit to a major soft spot for titanium bikes and we've tested dozens of them over the years. These are the best titanium road bikes you can buy.

Titanium road bikes were once rare and expensive because titanium is notoriously difficult to work with but the cost of a titanium bike has dropped significantly in recent years. Titanium road bikes are now if not affordable at least a viable alternative to top-end steel and carbon fibre bikes.

Titanium bikes are prized for the longevity that comes from the metal's resistance to corrosion and fatigue and for its rather lovely silver-grey colour.

With a density between steel and aluminium titanium is a great material for bikes; a titanium bike can be lighter than steel without the big tubes of aluminium or carbon fibre. Fans of titanium bikes also point to a 'springy' ride quality that helps them float over bumps

On the downside you can't get a titanium bike repaired at any old local framebulder; welding titanium requires the right equipment and skill.

The best titanium road bikes

Best overall: Kinesis Tripster ATR — Buy Now for £2200 (frame and fork) from Kinesis Cycles The Kinesis Tripster ATR can handle a really wide range of riding and it's a beautifully made comfortable and responsive titanium bike. There's very little we wouldn't be happy doing on it. It's sensibly priced too; by no means a budget option but not stratospherically expensive considering its level of refinement. ATR stands for Adventure-Tour-Race and that's the clue that it was Kinesis' ambition to make this bike as versatile as possible. The frame is beautifully put together. The welds are extremely neat and the minimal graphics – and laser-etched head badge – are just what you want on a titanium bike leaving most of the bike as bare metal. Throughout a huge range of types of ride and lots of commuting and shorter excursions the ATR confirmed itself as a composed and comfortable ride. It's quick if you want it to be but also relaxed and easy to pilot. For the most part it's lovely. The latest incarnation the Tripster ATR v3 includes the Kinesis Range carbon fibre fork. Read our review of the Kinesis Tripster ATR

Best on a budget: Van Nicholas Ventus — Buy Now starting at £2590 from Van Nicholas Although the Van Nicholas Ventus is classed as the company's entry-level option the way it performs is anything but. This bike is simply great fun to ride. There is a surprising amount of stiffness in these slender tubes though in no way does it lose that lovely springy titanium ride. It's a looker too and quite the bargain. For 2021 Van Nicholas has made some tweaks to the Ventus to bring it up to date for a modern take on the performance road bike. It's swapped out the rim brakes for hydraulic discs incorporated 12mm thru-axles and upped the tyre clearance to 28mm – not huge but that's plenty of rubber for a race bike. Read our review of the Van Nicholas Ventus

Best race bike: Moots Vamoots Disc RSL Di2 (frame & fork) — Buy Now for £6500 from Saddleback The Moots Vamoots Disc RSL is one of those bikes that once you've had the chance to ride it you just aren't going to want to give back. It delivers the performance of many high-end carbon fibre race machines while retaining that beautiful titanium ride. As in: how can a frame as firm as this still offer such a sublime feel and so much feedback? Like all materials used in frame manufacturing though everything still comes down to great design. Tube profiles wall thicknesses and geometry are the key and Moots has absolutely nailed it with the Vamoots Disc RSL. When you get aboard the Vamoots it's great to feel just what can be achieved with titanium. This frame feels incredibly tight and just goads you into pushing it as hard as you can into every bend or straight that you can find. It's just so balanced. So much feedback through the frame and fork that you can be properly at one with the machine every ripple felt and change of camber dealt with by just the tiniest flick of the handlebar or shift of bodyweight. Read our review of the Moots Vamoots Disc RSL Di2

Best luxury option: Mason Aspect — Buy Now starting at £5200 from Mason Cycles The Aspect from Mason Cycles is a thing of beauty not only in the way it looks but also in the way it rides. The frameset offers so much depth in the way it behaves thanks to the tubeset the fork and the geometry all working together to give a sublime ride quality and an excellent level of feedback no matter how rough the road surface is. Titanium frames often have a very specific feel about them offering that smoothness of a quality steel frame yet with a firmness edging towards that of an aluminium alloy one. Mason has exploited this very cleverly indeed. Read our review of the Mason Aspect

Best cyclo-crosser: Moots Psychlo X — Buy Now starting at £5800 from Bespoke Cycling The Psychlo X from legendary framebuilders Moots is a extremely talented titanium bike with bags of speed complemented by comfort and assured handling. It's adept at cyclo-cross racing but is really capable of rides of far bigger scope and imagination than an hour around a muddy field the mainstay of 'cross races in the UK. It's a popular bike with the gravel race and adventure set in the US and if you want a bike of such capability the Psychlo X will fulfill your wishes. Read our review of the Moots Psychlo X

J.Guillem Major 105 — Buy Now for ~£2900 from J.Guillem If you want the performance and stiffness of a carbon fibre race bike but with the subtle hints of a titanium ride quality the J.Guillem Major definitely needs to be on your shopping list. Its comfort levels might be at odds with the UK road surfaces at times but boy does this thing shift and it looks a beauty too. The Major isn't a race bike but it does have more than a nod to performance so the fact that it is quick shouldn't come as a huge shock but just how well it did perform blew me away. Putting a little more pressure on the pedals and removing it from the saddle and to an extent my arms and wrists took the edge off the firmness and the Major felt like a completely different bike. Read our review of the J.Guillem Major 105

Mosaic RT-1 — Buy Now starting at ~£5000 from The Bike Tailor US titanium frame builder Mosaic Bespoke Bicycles hail from Boulder in Colorado founded by Aaron Barcheck who used to work for Dean Titanium Bicycles. That expertise shows in the RT-1 a finely built titanium frame with custom butted size-specific 3Al/2.5V titanium tubes with a full bespoke option available. The ride performance is as you’d hope excellent with a pleasingly taut characteristic that likes to go fast all of the time. Read our review of the Mosaic RT-1

Sabbath September Disc — Buy Now for £1200 (frame fork & headset) from Spa Cycles The Sabbath September Disc is an titanium road bike aimed at riding Audax events that’s right at home on the daily commute club ride or sportive with disc brakes and the titanium frame joined up front by a carbon fibre fork. The September Disc was one of the first breed of new versatile titanium bikes designed with disc brakes and the 3Al/2.5V takes up to 35mm tyres with mudguards. If you want one bike to do just about everything with the exception of racing the Sabbath is a fine choice. Read our review of the Sabbath September Disc

Enigma Evoke Ti — Buy Now starting at £4500 from Enigma Bikes With the same front triangle including a 44mm head tube and downtube as the Enigma Evade titanium bike we tested a few of years ago the Evoke is Enigma's 'fast endurance' bike now equipped with discs and the necessary frame and fork refinement to make them work well. If it's like the Evade — and there's no reason to expect otherwise — it will offer a rewarding ride for those cyclists that like to press hard on the pedals. Read our review of the Enigma Evade Ti

Ribble Endurance Ti Disc Enthusiast — Buy Now for £3299 from Ribble Cycles Ribble has been very clever when it comes to the design of its Endurance Ti Disc Enthusiast. By using tube profiles that exploit the natural smooth ride feel of titanium and geometry designed to offer the compact aero position of a race bike but without the associated fast and sometimes twitchy handling Ribble delivers a bike you can ride quickly and comfortably regardless of the distance. Bike designers and testers often wax lyrical about the ride feel you get from a titanium frame but it's true – it's one of the best out there. Just like any frame material though the tube profiles wall thicknesses and the way each tube interacts with the others all play their part; get it right and your titanium frame will deliver a smooth ride that removes plenty of high-frequency road buzz feel while still delivering on stiffness. Ribble has got it right. Long distances on the Enthusiast are a joy – you can really cover a lot of miles very quickly and it'd make a great audax or sportive machine – but it's not just because of the comfort levels coming from the frame and fork it's also to do with the geometry. Read our review of the Ribble Endurance Ti Disc Enthusiast

Honourable mentions

Van Nicholas Rowtag — Buy Now starting at £3454 from Van Nicholas The Van Nicholas Rowtag is a new titanium bike that's capable of fast gravel blasts and multi-day adventure rides. It isn't the quickest off the line but if you want stability versatility and durability you really can't go wrong here. Van Nicholas bills the Rowtag as a 'crossover gravel racer' and it offers a stable ride whatever the terrain you're tackling. It's one of those bikes that holds its line well over pothole-strewn tracks and fast bumpy descents giving you loads of confidence to push the speed. Read our review of the Van Nicholas Rowtag

Litespeed Cherohala 105 — Buy Now for £4499.99 from Pedal Revolution Allroad that's what Litespeed has labelled its Cherohala SE frame which builds into a titanium bike that's just as happy on the tarmac as it is on the local towpath or gravel track. It's not perfect on either but it has a surprisingly large crossover area which makes for a fun and quick ride. With its heavily sloped top tube and tall head tube the proportions of the Cherohala's frame didn't look like they were going to offer up an exciting ride on the road. Not so. This thing is quick. Not in an adrenaline-fuelled mass-acceleration or demon-descending kind of way – that's not what it's about – but if you want to cover big distances quickly without fuss this is a great titanium bike to do it on.

Read our review of the Reilly Gradient

Snowdon Paradox — Buy Now for £3999 from Snowdon Cycles The name of the first model released by Bristol's Snowdon Bikes is apt – the Paradox.

Reilly T325 — Buy Now for £1899 (frame fork & headset) from Reilly The brand of the late Mark Reilly the T325 is the most affordable titanium bike in the range. Reilly's 30 years of frame building experience shows in the frame which is lovingly designed with neat details such as an externally reinforced head tube oversized main tubes space for 28mm tyres and internal routing for a Di2 groupset. At a claimed 1275g the frame is a worthy alternative to a carbon fibre race bike. Read our review of the Reilly T325

J.Guillem Atalaya — Buy Now starting at ~£3800 from J.Guillem With exquisite attention to detail understated looks and a cracking good ride on road forest paths and gravel tracks with space for wide tyres on 700C or 650B wheels the J.Guillem Atalaya Gravel is an enticing choice in the premium titanium gravel bike market. Shaking down a rough bridleway tyres scrabbling for grip on the dry dirt before emerging back on to a country lane all smiles and giggles we were won over by the J.Guillem Atalaya Gravel with its feeling of control and capability on a variety of terrain. That's the beauty of riding big tyre road bikes of course but not all gravel bikes are cut from the same cloth. With the Atalaya there's enough compliance to help it deal with everything from poorly surfaced country lanes to bridleways and forest tracks. Read our review of the J.Guillem Atalaya

Things to know about titanium bikes

Titanium bikes are desirable because titanium is lighter than steel and stronger than aluminium or most steel alloys. Titanium's high fatigue resistance means a titanium bike should last forever. It’s those traits that have ensured it has continued to be a popular choice with cyclists wanting a fine riding bike that will last the length of time. Plus of course there is the fabled ride quality of titanium bikes which is reminiscent of a steel frame with plenty of spring and high comfort but it can be used to build a stiff race bike depending on tubing diameters and profiles.

Most titanium bikes have frames made from 3Al/2.5V tubing (where titanium is alloyed with 3% aluminium and 2.5% vanadium) and 6Al/4V a harder grade of titanium is seen on much more expensive framesets. Because it’s hard and expensive to make 6Al/4V into seamless tubes it’s often used for machined parts like dropouts and head tubes.

The unique colour of titanium ensures it stands out against most other road bikes. Various finishes are available the tubes can be brushed or bead-blasted and can even be painted if you prefer but many people buying titanium do so partly for its unique and timeless appearance. A titanium frame will still look good in 10 years time.

Titanium has been used to make bicycle frames for about 30 years. In the early days there was only a handful of brands specialising in titanium and US brands like Seven Serotta Litespeed and Merlin built an enviable reputation for their expertise with the material. Titanium frames are now commonly manufactured in the Far East which has led to prices coming down quite a lot into the realms of affordability for many.

DeSantis to veto SLERS contract,"Motorola Solutions sent a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday asking him to veto a budget item that grants Harris Corp. a contract to upgrade and maintain the state’s police radio network.

The 2021-22 budget passed by lawmakers includes $165 million in in nonrecurring funding to upgrade the Statewide Law Enforcement Radio System and awards the company a 15-year contract at $31.5 million a year — $19 million to oversee the system and $12.5 million to lease radio towers controlled by the company.

The new agreement comes after a years-long war that at one point saw Motorola win the SLERS contract only for Harris Corp. to challenge it in court and eventually come out on top through the legislative budgeting process.

With the letter Motorola Solutions is taking its last stab at preventing the deal before the Governor signs the budget and codifies the Harris Corp. contract into law.

“This unprecedented legislative action infringes on your executive powers by circumventing the active Invitation to Negotiate from the Department of Management Services that would have allowed your agency to decide which vendor would provide the best value to Florida” Motorola Solutions CEO Greg Brown wrote in the letter.

“Signing the budget with line items and provisos that were quietly negotiated between the incumbent vendor and the legislature will result in a bad deal for taxpayers and a dangerous situation for Florida’s first responders.”

As written in the budget Harris Corp.’s solution would cost $640 million in payments over the next 15 years. Brown states that Motorola Solutions would provide a new state-of-the-art P25 system and radios for substantially less. To illustrate this point he noted Motorola Solutions was approximately $300 million lower cost than Harris when it won the last competitive bid.

Brown urged DeSantis to strike the lease payments which total $187.5 million from the budget and stick to the recommendations in the Governor’s budget proposal calling for $13 million to replace broken police radios and put the remainder of the $55 million set aside for new radios up for a competitive bid.

“The Legislature’s actions to infringe on your executive power and to circumvent an active procurement for the sole benefit of a single vendor set a dangerous precedent. Entering into a contract of this size and magnitude through legislative fiat has never occurred during an open procurement and should not be approved especially given the operational delays substandard coverage and technical issues that have plagued the incumbent operator” Brown wrote.

“The State of Florida has always supported a very deliberate process for major contract decisions that includes development of a business case to support good decision making. Toward that end the state hired an outside objective expert last year and has since paid it more than $1 million to analyze the situation consider alternatives formulate recommendations and support the current ITN. All of that effort and expenditure of taxpayer dollars has been undermined at the last minute via legislative action.”

The aim is to promote trust in police work through transparency and to increase the safety of police officers. With a contract value of €15M the project is one of the largest bodycam projects in the world contractor Motorola Solutions announced.

The rugged VB400 bodycams were developed specifically for this purpose. Intuitive recording functions and extended battery life (up to 12 hours) are characteristic features of the cameras. In the future a Holster Aware function will be offered which automatically activates the recording of the camera as soon as an officer draws his weapon. As part of the project Motorola Solutions is also supplying a range of accessories including helmet cameras for motorbike police officers which enable high-resolution recordings even at high speeds.

The new body cameras are used in combination with a VideoManager digital evidence management solution which allows recorded video to be automatically stored and archived along with time date and location and officer-added incident data. Motorola Solutions BodyCams are already in use by authorities and civilian customers in the UK USA and Romania.

Lockdowns have upended the global economy which contracted by 3.5 per cent in 2020 according to the International Monetary Fund.

With the development of Covid-19 vaccines in record time and their rapid rollout in many countries in 2021 Citi analysts now expect a lasting global economic expansion including a sharp temporary bounce-back following the distortions to the world economy at the pandemic’s onset.

But there is still uncertainty around the pace and evenness of economic recovery which will closely depend on the success of the vaccine rollout. Other trends will also shape investment preferences and wealth management in the near to medium term.

Reassessing emerging markets

Given the changes underway many investors are choosing to be more discerning and waiting for the dust to settle before putting their capital to work. For others however the pandemic is an opportunity to reassess investment game plans and portfolio allocations with some strategies and sectors drawing more interest than others.

While most global markets staged a remarkable recovery in the latter half of 2020 to close the year on a positive note many emerging markets lagged behind. As economic activity slowed with the pandemic the worst affected countries struggled to invest in essential health infrastructure and delivery of health services.

The result was a surge in debt. Global debt increased by $24tn in 20201 with about half of that pertaining to government support programmes to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19. Government debt stood at 105 per cent of GDP as of 2020 up from 88 per cent in 20192 and it is expected to rise further this year given that interest rates are still low.

Trends shaping investment

Amid the uncertainty some long-term trends are emerging which investors might consider as they look to rejig their portfolios in a post-Covid-19 world.

These include the rise of Asia aspirations for a greener future digital disruption and increasing longevity. All offer risks and opportunities for investors.

Businesses of all kinds have been compelled to jump on the digitalisation bandwagon as a result of the pandemic which has also seen growing revenues for telemedicine providers teleconferencing companies online retailers over-the-top (OTT) media companies and others that enjoyed a surge in demand through lockdowns.

The rollout of 5G in various countries will be transformational for many industries opening up investment opportunities according to Citi analysts*. Citi's “hyper-connectivity” basket of stocks with high exposure to new and emerging technologies3 has comfortably outperformed both the MSCI AC World as well as the MSCI AC World Info Tech indices over the past 10 years.

Be patient and think long-term

Creating right investment environment

Focus on finding the business value

Spot great businesses

Don’t over-diversify

Have an ‘edge’ over others

Follow a good investment process

Keep learning from mistakes

Ignore the noise

Path to ‘Worldy Wisdom’









It is very rare to see true long-term investment success where an investor ’s returns outperform the index year after year. But Nicholas Sleep has done that for 12 years returning an average of 18.4% per annum year after year.Sleep’s name may not find place among the investing legends that the market keep talking about all the time. But he has a superb investment track record and is regarded as one of most successful man in investing.Sleep managed the Nomad Investment Partnership for over a decade along with his partner Qais Zakaria delivering 921% returns against 117% for the MSCI World Index between September 2001 and December 2013.Yet he always kept a low profile. He started gaining recognition recently following the publication of the Nomad Investment Partnership letters which have earned a lot of appreciation in the investment circle.Like many of the world’s greatest investors Nick Sleep had an unorthodox start to his investing career. He didn’t take up business or finance but studied geography to which he credits his love for asking questions.In 2001 after a decade in the industry Sleep and his partner Qais Zakaria launched the Nomad Investment Partnership. After beating the index for 13 years [20.8% per annum vs 6.5% index return per annum] Nomad was closed in 2014 as Sleep sought more ‘caring pursuits’.His insights and knowledge on how to achieve success in investing is second to none. His pearls of wisdom have helped investors intimately understand the thoughts and mental models of many great investors.Many investing veterans agree Sleep’s letters to the partners held rare insights and they can go a long way in helping people achieve long-term investment success.Sleep says before investing in a company investors tend to focus only on what can be measured which is mostly aided by analysts and to some extent by their own laziness.But one can actually get a wealth of information about a company by focusing on its advertising marketing and research & development product integrity product life cycle market share and the character of the management.“Information like food has a sell-by date. After all next quarter’s earnings are worthless after next quarter. And it is for this reason that the information that Zak and I weigh most heavily in thinking about a firm is the ones which have the longest shelf life” he says in one of the Nomad Investment Partnership letters.Sleep says the trick to being a good investor in the long run is to maintain a long term-oriented discipline. He says patience plays a key role in maintaining that discipline as sometimes emotions can get the better of people.Sleep says in order to earn returns better than other investors it is essential for one to do things differently from the crowd. “We can all do momentum investing but it is emotional investing and I just don’t think it is that intelligent or profitable. Good investing is a minority sport which means in order to earn returns better than everyone else one needs to be doing things differently from the crowd. And one of the things that the crowd is not is patient” he says.Sleep says in order to make the right decision it is important for investors to think rationally for which the right kind of environment is essential.“We have the right environment to think things through think rationally and come to meaningful long-term insights. Whether our insights are economic or not will be our fault; it will not be due to the environment in which we work” he says.Sleep feels it is sometimes important to just hold on and do nothing when the environment is not conducive for investing. Also he feels investors can compare an attractive investment opportunity with their already existing portfolio to decide whether they should invest or just stay put.“Many great businesses are available at what seem sensible prices but in our view they do not compare favourably with what we already own and so we move on constantly comparing what we have with the alternatives but often as far as the portfolio is concerned doing nothing” he said.Sleep says investors should focus on the value of the underlying business which they can derive from their thorough research rather than basing their decisions on the company’s last share price quote.“We own shares for multi-year periods. So our continued investment success has far more to do with the economics of the underlying businesses than with their last share price quote. The trick it seems to us is to be a successful long-term investor one needs to recognise the sources of enduring business success get in early and own enough to make a difference” he says.Sleep says in order to spot these great businesses one can look for firms that have a process of doing many things a little better than their rivals. As these firms' future success is more predictable they are simply harder to beat.“The simple deep reality for many of our firms is the virtuous spiral established when companies keep their costs down margins low and in doing so share their growing scale with their customers. In the long run this will be more important in determining the destination for our firms than the distractions of the day” says he.Sleep says most analysts and experts suggest investors to diversify their portfolios with many stocks as it can give them an insurance against the market volatility.But it is better to have a well-researched portfolio of only a few stocks and have good knowledge about them rather than having a diversified portfolio of many stocks bought after conducting limited research.“The church of diversification in whose pews the professional fund management industry sits proposes many holdings. They do this not because managers have so many insights but so few! Diversity in this context is seen as insurance against any one idea being wrong. Like Darwin we find ourselves disagreeing with the theocracy. We would propose that if knowledge is a source of value added and few things can be known for sure then it logically follows that owning more stocks does not lower risk but raises it” he says.Sleep says there are three sources of competitive advantages in investing which can help one achieve success and get ahead of her peers.“There are three competitive advantages in investing: informational (I know a meaningful fact nobody else does); analytical (I have cut up the public information to arrive at a superior conclusion); and psychological (that is to say behavioural)… but the enduring advantages are mainly psychological” he says.Sleep says if investors follow a good investment process then they are sure to get success in the long run although its effect may not be visible immediately.“Good investment process is not apparent in one quarter’s worth of transient stock price quotations or one year for that matter!” says he.Sleep says investors should consider the mistakes they make as learning opportunities. He says investors often make the mistake of keeping a static view of a firm formed at the time of purchasing a stock which fails to evolve as the facts change.This error gets reinforced by misjudgments such as denial (the facts changed) and ego (we can’t be wrong). There is also an over-dependence on price-to-value ratio type analysis which can encourage a tighter range of outcomes than what occurs in reality.“There is a philosophical argument that a mistake is only a mistake if you call it so. Otherwise it is a learning opportunity. That seems like the right spirit to us. In investment terms once lessons have been learnt mistakes can be put on the price-earnings ratio of one and the resultant good behaviour on a ratio of more than one. In other words mistakes become net present value positive” he says.Sleep urges investors to try and ignore the noise and market chatter going on around them and trust their own research before picking stocks.“The investment industry as well as many economic commentators spend so much time shouting. So much commentary espouses certainty on a multitude of issues and so little of what is said is at least in our opinion knowable. The absolute certainty in the voice of the proponent so often seeks to mask the weakness of the argument. If I spot this I metaphorically tune out. In our opinion just a few big things in life are knowable” he said.Sleep believes the real thrills of the investment process is discovery and learning which can lead investors to achieve ‘Worldy Wisdom’.“Worldly wisdom is a good phrase for the intellectual capital with which investment decisions are made and at the end of the day it is the source of any superior investment results that we may enjoy” he said.Sleep never relied on complex models non-public information or business relationships to deliver his returns. Instead he used his learnings from other disciplines which he applied to his thinking.He always liked to ask questions think patiently turning ideas upside down and challenge conventional wisdom which helped him gain insights that other investors couldn’t see. He stuck to his core competency liked to keep things simple and recognised the basic nature of the businesses he owned which gave him the patience to remain invested in multibaggers.",,,,,,

Seventeen years on from his feature film debut – a 2004 remake of George Romero’s iconic Dawn of the Dead movie – Snyder returns to his horror roots in his first post-Warner Bros project.

Billed as a zombie-heist film Army of the Dead is the first of three Netflix projects to which Snyder is tied to – and it’s one that draws big parallels with Romero’s influential zombie back catalog.

Ahead of the film’s launch on May 21 TechRadar sat down with Snyder and its cast to discuss how Army of the Dead like Romero’s works reimagines the zombie genre through its social commentary. We also find out what inspired Army of the Dead’s creation and the reasons that audiences might sympathize with the movie’s undead hordes.

Reviving an old idea

(Image credit: Netflix)

Set in the aftermath of a Las Vegas-based zombie outbreak Army of the Dead follows Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) a retired zombie war hero who is approached by casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) with an intriguing proposition. The task? Complete a mission into the zombie-infested city to retrieve $200 million from one of Tanaka’s casino vaults and Ward will earn $50 million as his reward.

Ward agrees to Tanaka’s proposal and assembles a team of specialists including fellow ex-soldiers Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) and Maria Cruz (Ana de la Reguera) prolific safe-cracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) a zombie expert and Las Vegas guide known as the Coyote (Nora Arnezeder) and helicopter pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro).

However when the group is unexpectedly joined by Ward’s daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) and Tanaka’s Head of Security Martin (Garret Dillahunt) with mysterious assignments of their own survival – not money – becomes their number one priority.

Army of the Dead is Snyder’s first non-superhero movie since 2014’s 300: Rise of an Empire but it’s an idea he’s had for some time. A concept born during his time on Dawn of the Dead Snyder had initially hired writer Joby Harolds to pen a script ahead of his project’s original March 2007 announcement. However a plethora of problems including a costly budget put paid to those plans and the project was put on ice.

With his Warner Bros commitments ending with 2017’s Justice League – this year’s Snyder Cut of the same movie aside – Snyder’s search for his next venture eventually led him back to the idea he conceived years earlier.

In a sense it’s poetic that Snyder would resuscitate a movie about the undead over a decade later. As he explains though his original vision for the film hasn’t dramatically changed in the intervening years save for one personal alteration.

“When I sat down with [screenwriter] Shay Hatten I told him ‘Let’s not read the old script’ Snyder recalls. “I said ‘Let me tell you the idea and we’ll just do it from scratch’. It [the general idea] hasn’t changed that much but it [the script] has become enthused with who we are right now. Scott and Kate’s relationship for example has changed because my relationship with my kids has changed.”

Unleashing the undead

(Image credit: Netflix/Clay Enos)

Reinventing zombies isn’t a new concept to the genre. Similar movies such as Romero’s Land of the Dead or Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later have introduced intelligent and athletic zombies respectively to the genre in order to increase the threat that the undead pose to humans.

To differentiate itself from movies that have come before Army of the Dead approaches its zombies from an emotional perspective. Army of the Dead embraces the genre’s standard slow-moving zombies – referred to as shamblers by Ward and company – but it also establishes a new breed of zombie that displays emotion.

Enter the alphas: fast strong intelligent and emoting zombies who in the confines of the walled-off Las Vegas rein over the city’s undead hordes. The formation of a zombie society not dissimilar to our own or those seen in family-oriented animals is borne out of this hierarchical approach and gives Army of the Dead’s zombies a personable feel.

In combining their human appearance with the pack-based mannerisms of wolves and lions Snyder believes that audiences will empathize with the movie’s alpha zombies despite their dangerous nature.

“Zombies don’t usually have a consciousness and are hard to connect to” he explains. “But in this case I really wanted them to have this emotion. I treated them like pack animals who nuzzle each other [to reaffirm their emotional bonds]. I felt that if I could have the audience feel sympathy or connect to the zombies then I would have succeeded [with that approach].”

Emotional talking points

As well as its zombie-centric plot and action-packed sequences Army of the Dead is a thematically dense movie. Its examination of political and societal issues – such as immigration and misogyny – is timely given how often they appear in the current news cycle.

In the same way that Romero’s Dawn of the Dead was a satirical critique of consumer culture and capitalism or Train to Busan explored class divide Army of the Dead’s creative team sought to address these subjects in a sensitive manner – and they certainly left their mark on the film’s cast.

“It’s humbling to add to conversations that are often had in a very persistent and consistent way on social media” Hardwick says. “You have that commentary in a movie because this is the era where we have to be there for each other globally. For us to say ‘Hey we’re gonna search this stuff even if we have to put apple sauce around this medicine we’re getting people to digest with cool shots action moments and a diverse cast’ that’s pretty powerful.”

“It’s not a cliched zombie movie” Arnezeder muses. “It criticizes a lot of important topics in our society such as refugees and social identity and I think the best thing about making art is taking risks which this does. It’s very visual and poetic [in that sense] and makes for a profound story.”

Zack Snyder is very aware as an artist... I get why because he's always inserting things that need to be talked about. Omari Hardwick Army of the Dead star

Family is also a core theme at the movie’s heart. While Ward’s group has a familial feel to it despite their varying nationalities and backgrounds it’s the relationship between Scott and Kate that drives particular theme forward. For reasons we won’t spoil the duo’s father-daughter bond is dysfunctional at best. Scott and Kate regularly butt heads and it’s these emotionally charged scenes that specifically challenged Bautista.

“I’m not the most seasoned actor and I don’t have a theatrical background” he says. “So when you’re in those scenes it can be exhausting. This film is the first where I had to go through multiple emotions in a very short time but I want these types of roles so I can stretch myself.”

Army of the Dead brings Snyder’s career full circle following his Dawn of the Dead remake but his filmmaking work is far from over. Next up for the writer-director are two Army of the Dead spin-offs for Netflix – Army of Thieves and Lost Vegas – that will explore the backstories of certain characters in more detail.

Similar to Romero’s zombie films which equally act as character studies Snyder ultimately views Army of the Dead as a character-led movie. The influence of Romero’s works on multiple aspects of his latest project are evident then – and in Snyder’s own view had as big an impact on Army of the Dead as his other filmmaking experiences did.

“It’s funny how the emotional part of the movie is its centerpiece” Snyder says. “All of the characters where they are emotionally become the movie’s heart. Yeah it’s a zombie-heist movie but it’s also a character-led one. I feel like I’ve evolved since Dawn of the Dead and the movie has become more important to me than it was 15 years ago.”

While workplace sitcoms are not exactly a rare commodity fantastic ones that make you root for their characters and experience serious feelings are. And that's why we had to keep our list to just 13 — so that only the strongest get our equivalent of the Dundees.

And to make sure you don't get bored we made sure to have most of these not actually set in traditional offices. This list of shows to watch after The Office takes you from the pitch of a soccer field to the world of video game development and from public sector goofballs to the folks making your local retail experience actually work. Oh and Gotham City too.

Read on for our list of 13 shows to watch after The Office.

1. Mythic Quest

(Image credit: Apple TV+)

The Apple TV Plus series Mythic Quest manages to find a lot of humor in the eccentricities of the broken human beings making a fictional online game. It all starts with egomaniacal Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) who is as much of a chore to work for as he is obsessed with his own physique. Oh and if you're reading Ian as ""ee-an"" he'd correct you. It's pronounced ""eye-an."" Ian's weird relationships are the core of season one of Mythic Quest and the most prominent is with Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) the lead engineer of the game who is struggling to be taken seriously by Ian. Poppy's completely socially inept one category of life that Ian is somehow not screwed up in. Ian also terrorizes the game's exec producer David who has the confidence of a mealworm.

Game testers Rachel (Ashly Burch) and Dana (Imani Hakim) are so bored with their job that it seems like they're going to take a break for romance — even though they keep getting interrupted. The Mythic Quest cast is rounded out by F. Murray Abraham as CW Longbottom the game's pretentious scribe. And don't overlook Danny Pudi who plays as Brad Bakshi — the suit in charge of monetization making him the ultimate bad guy (trying to get you to buy stuff in-game). — Henry T. Casey

2. Brooklyn Nine-Nine

A comedy about cops might not be everyone’s cup of tea in the current climate but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has consistently been both hilarious and sensitive to real-world issues. Its handling of race has been at times quite remarkable highlighting real issues while never dropping a comedy moment. It’s clearly a remarkably skilled writing team. The final series of the show yet to air either on broadcast or streaming networks got a significant rework in light of recent incidents and the show is unlikely to shy away from the discussion.

But all of that aside Brooklyn Nine-Nine is an absolutely brilliant comedy. A truly magnificent cast is led by Andy Samberg (who also produces). plus a mix of famous and less famous faces. Andre Braugher hasn’t forged a career in comedy shows but his performance is one of the best elements here: his straight-laced character Raymond Holt brings so much to the fictional precinct and his on-screen time is a genuine joy. It’s worth watching this show to see how Holt as well as Stephanie Beatriz’s character Rosa Diaz develop over the eight seasons. — Ian Morris

3. The Office (UK)

(Image credit: BBC)

Although the U.S. version of The Office is technically a remake of the U.K. original the two are so different that they might as well be from different planets rather than different continents. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s take on life in the Wernham Hogg Paper Merchants is far darker and a lot ruder than its U.S. counterpart while Gervais’ David Brent is altogether less likable than Michael Scott.

It’s also much shorter: Just 14 episodes were made including two Christmas specials. That said it packs a lot into those 7 hours and 40 minutes and many of the themes and characters from the Scranton version have their origins here. Brent is the archetypal bad boss the relationship between Martin Freeman’s Jim and Lucy Davis’ Dawn mirrors that of Jim and Pam and Mackenzie Crook is brilliant as the Dwight prototype Gareth.

You’ll even recognize some individual scenes many of which made their way into the U.S. Office’s first season. We’re not going to get drawn into the debate over which is better but the fact that opinion is split should be reason enough to give the U.K. Office a go. — Marc McLaren

Watch on Prime Video or HBO Max

4. Harley Quinn

(Image credit: Claudette Barius)

Not all coworkers wear formalwear and work around a watercooler. The animated Harley Quinn series sees Mr. J's former sidekick striking out on her own after yet another break up. And in this series Quinn (voiced by Kaley Cuoco) is building her own team — and she's learning how tough it is to hire (just like when the Michael Scott Paper Company started). One of her worst hires is Dr. Psycho (Tony Hale) who would get in serious trouble with HR (if she had such a team). The gang has more than a few strong team players including Clayface (Alan Tudyk) and King Shark (Ron Funches) who try to help Quinn with her aspirations to be a big player in Gotham's crime scene.

Quinn's also learning how to be a good boss as she often seems more interested in getting into the Justice League than working with her team. Relationship drama ensues when Quinn's best friend Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) starts dating the lowly Kite-Man who's a C-tier super villain at best. Harley Quinn's second season is also fantastic as Penguin The Riddler Mr. Freeze Two-Face and Bane take over Gotham City and their run as the comically flawed Injustice League is fantastic. — Henry T. Casey

Watch on HBO Max

5. Ted Lasso

(Image credit: Apple TV Plus)

You didn't need to care about paper to be drawn to the sales team at Dunder-Mifflin and you don't need to understand soccer to love Ted Lasso. The series stars Jason Sudeikis as the titular coach who lives a true fish-out-of-water story as he switches jobs from working in collegiate football to travelling across the pond to lead an English Premier League team. And just like how The Office had colleagues that just don't get along with each other AFC Richmond (the team he's managing) has the smug Jamie Tart a pretty boy who knows how good he is and isn't afraid to slack off.

Ted Lasso wins (as a show) though because of the teamwork and positivity that Coach Lasso promotes. In a moment where too many shows are exhaustingly negative Lasso's inherent upbeat positivity is his strongest weapon in surviving. And life at AFC Richmond is tough as their record is poor and sports journalists continue to hound him for how little he knows. Plus while his boss Rebecca isn't clueless like Michael Scott she's equally troublesome with her own motivations. — Henry T. Casey

6. Arrested Development

(Image credit: Netflix)

Arrested Development is old enough now to find an entirely new audience that missed it when it aired on Fox back in 2003. Without doubt this is the pinnacle of American comedy especially in the first three seasons. Netflix picked the show up after its cancelation and produced more episodes but it never quite achieved the brilliance of the early episodes there. It is without doubt still well worth watching.

The construction of Arrested Development episodes is a work of absolute genius. As the story unfolds you’ll be delighted by how an episode arc unfolds. You’ll see things happen across the season too which call back to earlier events. It’s clever but consistently funny. With an all-star cast that includes legends like the late great Jessica Walter David Cross Portia De Rossi Will Arnett and Jason Bateman. Not only that but comedy greats guest star with amazing regularity including Henry Winkler and Judy Greer. Arrested Development was always a critics favourite for it’s smart well-written episodes but it’s more accessible than you might think. — Ian Morris

7. Parks & Rec

(Image credit: NBC)

Feeling almost like The Office’s sister show (Its co-creator is Office producer Greg Daniels) Parks and Recreation is another mockumentary-style sitcom but this one focuses on the local government of a fictional town in Indiana Pawnee. Sporting plenty of comedic talent in front of the camera — including Amy Poehler Rashida Jones Aubrey Plaza Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt — Parks and Rec is as endlessly quotable as The Office but it’s the loveable characters that have made it a binge-watching favorite for many.

Again just like The Office it does start out a little rough but push through the underwhelming first season and you’ll be rewarded with a show that can compete with the best Dunder Mifflin had to offer — Rory Mellon

Watch on Peacock

8. The IT Crowd

(Image credit: Channel 4 UK)

The IT Crowd focuses on the unsung heroes of office life: the I.T. support staff who keep the whole thing running. Although in this case they do a pretty poor job of it. Created by Graham Linehan the man behind the similarly surreal Father Ted The IT Crowd is essentially the story of what would happen if you put three incredibly different characters in a small basement room together made them all socially awkward and prone to screw ups then let them loose to wreak havoc.

That trio — shy geek Maurice (Richard Ayoade) lazy and boorish Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and out-of-her depth Jen (Katherine Parkinson) — are all supremely watchable and there’s a rotating cast of similarly over-the-top characters for them to play off including Chris Morris as the insane boss Denholm and Noel Fielding as the uber-goth Richmond. Very little here bears any resemblance to actual office life unless you work in a very very strange place but it’s constantly funny and frequently brilliant stuff all the same. — Marc McLaren

Watch on Netflix

9. Community

(Image credit: Sony Pictures Television)

Community is without doubt one of the best comedy shows ever to air on network TV. Creator Dan Harmon went on to develop the painfully self-aware animated comedy Rick and Morty with Justin Roiland but Community is where we first saw his flair for meta-comedy. And if you’re not a Rick and Morty fan don’t be put off: Community is a totally different beast.

Firstly the cast is exceptional. There’s no point trying to pick any of them out for praise here (Editor's Note: Donald Glover and Danny Pudi are exceptionally talented in the show) as it would just be a list of every one of the main stars and virtually every guest star who appeared. Every episode is a well-crafted story with brilliant insights into humanity as well as strong comedy. You’ll get to see the ongoing paintball saga unfold and watch virtually every movie genre. It's perhaps unsurprising that the Russo Brothers played a big role in directing the show before going off to tie up Marvel’s Avengers franchise with Infinity War and Endgame.

Harmon was fired by Sony before the start of season four it’s the weakest part of the show but still very worthy of viewing. Season five is a massive improvement and season six is a different beast but well worth watching. The show is famous for its mantra “six seasons and a movie” and we can only hope that a feature film emerges at some point in the future hopefully with the majority of its cast. — Ian Morris

10. The Good Place

(Image credit: Colleen Hayes/NBC)

If you’ve managed to avoid having the big twist of The Good Place's first season spoiled for you then you’re in for a real treat. The series showcases creator Michael Schur’s ability to make loveable characters in a strong ensemble that create plenty of laughs while never failing to move the story forward.

Unlike Shur’s other comedy shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Office The Good Place has a season and series arc that keeps things fresh and ultimately delivers it to a pretty endearing finale. Parks and Recreation also attempts this but with slightly less success.

The Good Place is often laugh-out-loud funny and its unique situation allows it to go wild with episodic themes and the jokes they inspire. Kristin Bell is flawless in everything she does and Ted Danson is a genius too. But the entire cast is gold — Schur’s skill is picking great actors for his shows — with it being absolutely critical to call out the incredible work of D'Arcy Carden especially in later seasons.

The Good Place is more than a comedy it’s an entire universe packed with both clever and obvious laughs. The last season is an emotional rollercoaster that winds up this series well and reminds you how the characters grew over just four years. Also make sure you follow each episode with the official podcast (don’t listen ahead though) hosted by Marc Evan Jackson it’s far better than it has any right to be and will provide a lot of insight into the production of the show. — Ian Morris

11. Superstore

(Image credit: NBC)

A workplace sitcom that will have any viewers with retail job experience cringing from reliability Superstore manages to deftly balance broad comedy with commentary on important social issues. Superstore took some time to find its groove (as many network comedies do) but over its six seasons it flourished into a show with real heart — and a charming ensemble cast to boot.

Superstore's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in its last season especially was a real highlight of its run and will surely stand as a powerful tribute to a troubled period of human history. If only actually working at a big-box store was as fun as Superstore makes it look. — Rory Mellon

12. Scrubs

(Image credit: NBC)

Scrubs is what happens when you find laughter and serious emotions on your way to growing up. While Jim Dwight Pam and the rest of the Dunder Mifflin crew are all adults each starts off the series a lot more immature than when they started (not that they become grizzled vets by the end). And Scrubs gives you a similar situation where J.D. (Zach Braff) Turk (Donald Faison) and Elliot (Sarah Chalke) are a part of the latest class of medical students to arrive at Sacred Heart Hospital where they find that things go wrong (and often).

Relationships blossom mentorships form and you quickly realize that Scrubs is a very good workplace comedy. And the fact that Scrubs gets as many laughs as it does from a hospital arguably the least funny setting is a testament to show-runner Bill Lawrence who also runs Ted Lasso. John C. McGinley's work as Dr. Perry Cox is probably the best the series offers when it comes to threading humor and nuance. — Henry T. Casey

13. Party Down

(Image credit: Starz)

What if your office always changed? What if your clients were people trying to have the best party of their lives? What if you just didn't really care? That's the situation at hand with Starz' Party Down a series about what it's like to work in the depressing world of catering. The show stars Adam Scott as Henry Pollard a guy who got his one big break with a TV ad and never got a second chance. The rest of his colleagues also have higher ambitions such as aspiring actors Casey Klein (Lizzy Caplan) and Kyle Bradway (Ryan Hansen) as well as the wannabe restaurateur Ron Donald (Ken Marino) and the script-writing Roman DeBeers (Martin Starr).

This crew of colleagues don't care at all about the work and barely function as a unit except to provide two seasons of great TV. Why only two? While Party Down was a great series on Starz it all fell apart when bigger shows such as Glee and Parks and Recreation kept poaching its cast. Party Down's casting agents proved nimble though bringing in Megan Mullally when Jane Lynch left. The good news is that Starz is bringing Party Down back for a third season. — Henry T.

Set in a world of expert knife-fighting Sharp promises to be a big-scale project as Netflix sealed a seven-figure deal with Padilha for the script and is hoping to launch a new action-focused franchise with this movie

The movie will be directed by Padilha who previously directed such action films as Elite Squad 7 Days in Entebbe and RoboCop as well as episodes of Netflix’s Narcos and working on Warrior’s Way. His Elite Squad 2 is the highest-grossing Brazilian film of all time. The script for Sharp was written by Padilha and actress Nicolette Noble whose writing credits include Pretty Gritty. Producer Greg Silverman of Stampede Ventures commented on this project:

“If you consider yourself an action fan and have not seen Elite Squad 1 and 2 you need to reevaluate your fandom. José Padilha is quite simply the most dynamic groundbreaking action director working today and we are so grateful he and Nicolette brought us on as partners to this great franchise.”

Producer Taylor Zea who previously worked on John Wick and Sicario will be overseeing the project for Netflix. Here’s everything else we know about Netflix’s Sharp:

What is the plot of Sharp?

According to its early synopsis Sharp follows a group of six knife-wielding assassins who after a globally-synchronized hit goes wrong are forced to work together to save themselves and discover who betrayed them.

Padilha and Noble said they read at least 20 books on blades from different times and cultures before writing Sharp.

“It boils down to this: gunfights are often anonymous; you can shoot someone from afar. Knife fights are always intimate up close and personal. We’re happy Netflix got the point no

pun intended.”

Who is cast in Sharp?

At this moment no cast members are known for Netflix’s Sharp but we’re expecting that to change soon. It is possible that writer Nicolette Noble will also be starring given that she is an actress as well but that remains to be seen.

What’s the production status of Sharp?

Netflix’s Sharp is currently in active development and filming dates will become known to us in the following months.

When will Sharp be released on Netflix?

Given a possible production start in the second half of 2021 we can potentially expect Sharp to drop on Netflix sometime late 2022 or 2023."

Five others who sustained serious burns are currently responding to treatment at the Hwidiem St Elizabeth Hospital.

A heavy storm at 5:30 pm on Friday caused extensive damages to properties and several electrical poles where live wires electrified some houses in the town.

Some people who were believed to have touched iron gates and metal objects in the electrified houses were rushed to the hospital.

But they were pronounced dead upon arrival by doctors on duty.

Meanwhile Ahafo Regional Minister George Boakye has commiserated with the bereaved families and those receiving treatment.

He described the incident as unfortunate and promised government’s support for the families of those dead and the injured.

The Regional Minister was accompanied by Robert Dwomoh Mensah the Asutifi South District Chief Executive and some officials of the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO).

The charred bodies have since been deposited at the Hospital.

It offers social support to Veterans who are experiencing loneliness or are socially isolated.

The virtual program allows volunteers to connect with Veterans in rural areas and sometimes across the country.

The program’s team at St. Louis VA placed second among international competitors for The Beryl Institute’s Organizational Innovation Award.

Maura Campbell voluntary service specialist at the VA St. Louis Healthcare System has received The Beryl Institute’s Individual Healthcare Professional Award for Excellence for her work implementing VA’s Compassionate Contact Corps.

Campbell serves as one of five implementation mentors around the country determined to help other sites implement their programs successfully.

Campbell discussed the Compassionate Contact Corps’ impact.

How did this program get started?

From a simple phone buddy program the Compassionate Contact Corps was born. As the quarantine stretched from weeks to months many of our VA social workers saw the need to continue referring new clients to the program to combat social isolation.

We have added new volunteers from our untapped VA volunteer family to meet this increasing need and now over 100 VA medical facilities in some stage of implementation.

What do you think is the Compassionate Contact Corps (CCC) program’s key to success?

The CCC expanded rapidly due to the pandemic the increased need for social interactions for Veterans and a core group of coordinators who have developed materials for the program and served as implementation mentors.

What type of outside support have you received?

We have garnered support from several Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) and civic organizations. We have partnered with the American Red Cross which made the CCC their signature program. In addition we have agreements with AARP and Rotary International to utilize their volunteers.

Why is this program important to you?

This program as well as the Volunteer In-Home Visitor Program have always been my passion. I know as human beings we need companionship to survive. We were created to be social and this program helps those most in danger of becoming depressed due to lack of human contact.

It’s in finding common good among our fellow humans that we thrive so I’m grateful to have been afforded the chance to help make these connections through my job. It doesn’t get much better than that.

Who benefits?

Our Veterans get an engaging social interaction with a volunteer. Our volunteers get to help Veterans on a very personal level. And our caregivers get a brief respite in the knowledge that their Veteran is having conversation with a volunteer. And our staff benefits from having an option for a social prescription for the Veterans they feel are isolated.

We are doing amazing things to improve patient experience for our Veterans at VA. Helping Veterans connect with other people is one of the greatest gifts we can give.

Is there anything else you’d like people to know?

I am humbled and honored to be recognized for my work with the Compassionate Contact Corps.

I would like to thank our team both locally and nationally. They’ve taken the program and supported it implemented it and shared it far and wide.

The award is part of The Beryl Institute’s International Patient Experience Innovation Awards and recognizes a healthcare professional who has created or led an innovation which resulted in positive change. Other criteria include leadership influence perseverance and caring.

To date over 100 VA facilities have implemented variations of the Compassionate Contact program. To participate Veterans must receive a referral from their VA clinician.

According to its website The Beryl Institute’s PX Innovation Awards provide a platform for sharing and celebrating great work across the globe to improve the human experience in health care. For information on The Beryl Institute visit www.theberylinstitute.org.

Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner have purchased neighbouring lots for custom homes in Hidden Hills the upscale LA enclave where they and their famous friends have settled in recent years.

It wasn’t clear how much the mum-and-daughter duo paid for the valuable real estate where Spears’ home once stood before being demolished.

But now Realtor records show that they dropped a combined $47.1 million (US$37M) for the 3.4-acre property near the edge of the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve in late December.

Khloé paid $21.7 million (US$17M) for a 1.86-acre lot on the same date her mum/manager purchased a $25.5 million (US$20M) 1.53-acre corner lot next door The Post reports.

They purchased it from an LLC registered to a small development company called Metro Development Homes records show.

Reportedly $36.1 million (US$28.3M) of that cash is going directly to construction and development costs since the land is assessed at (and was listed for) less than $11.5 million (US$9M).

What could the houses possibly include to cost that much?

Meanwhile Khloé’s house which she reportedly purchased with her boyfriend NBA star Tristan Thomas clocks in around 930 sq m but not much else is known about it according to Variety.

Both properties have over-size swimming pools with cabanas pictured show and are designed in the modern farmhouse architectural style according to Variety.

The Kardashians aren’t the first celebs to grace the lot — with Britney Spears renting the former home on the property in 2011 and 2012 for $25000 a month according to the LA Times.

It was demolished after the former owner “Million Dollar Listing” star Tracy Tutor’s father Ron Tutor sold the house in 2012.

The lot has stood empty ever since and landed in the hands of the now-defunct Ponzi scheme the Woodbridge Group before being sold to Metro Development.

It offers social support to Veterans who are experiencing loneliness or are socially isolated.

The virtual program allows volunteers to connect with Veterans in rural areas and sometimes across the country.

The program’s team at St. Louis VA placed second among international competitors for The Beryl Institute’s Organizational Innovation Award.

Maura Campbell voluntary service specialist at the VA St. Louis Healthcare System has received The Beryl Institute’s Individual Healthcare Professional Award for Excellence for her work implementing VA’s Compassionate Contact Corps.

Campbell serves as one of five implementation mentors around the country determined to help other sites implement their programs successfully.

Campbell discussed the Compassionate Contact Corps’ impact.

How did this program get started?

From a simple phone buddy program the Compassionate Contact Corps was born. As the quarantine stretched from weeks to months many of our VA social workers saw the need to continue referring new clients to the program to combat social isolation.

We have added new volunteers from our untapped VA volunteer family to meet this increasing need and now over 100 VA medical facilities in some stage of implementation.

What do you think is the Compassionate Contact Corps (CCC) program’s key to success?

The CCC expanded rapidly due to the pandemic the increased need for social interactions for Veterans and a core group of coordinators who have developed materials for the program and served as implementation mentors.

What type of outside support have you received?

We have garnered support from several Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) and civic organizations. We have partnered with the American Red Cross which made the CCC their signature program. In addition we have agreements with AARP and Rotary International to utilize their volunteers.

Why is this program important to you?

This program as well as the Volunteer In-Home Visitor Program have always been my passion. I know as human beings we need companionship to survive. We were created to be social and this program helps those most in danger of becoming depressed due to lack of human contact.

It’s in finding common good among our fellow humans that we thrive so I’m grateful to have been afforded the chance to help make these connections through my job. It doesn’t get much better than that.

Who benefits?

Our Veterans get an engaging social interaction with a volunteer. Our volunteers get to help Veterans on a very personal level. And our caregivers get a brief respite in the knowledge that their Veteran is having conversation with a volunteer. And our staff benefits from having an option for a social prescription for the Veterans they feel are isolated.

We are doing amazing things to improve patient experience for our Veterans at VA. Helping Veterans connect with other people is one of the greatest gifts we can give.

Is there anything else you’d like people to know?

I am humbled and honored to be recognized for my work with the Compassionate Contact Corps.

I would like to thank our team both locally and nationally. They’ve taken the program and supported it implemented it and shared it far and wide.

The award is part of The Beryl Institute’s International Patient Experience Innovation Awards and recognizes a healthcare professional who has created or led an innovation which resulted in positive change. Other criteria include leadership influence perseverance and caring.

To date over 100 VA facilities have implemented variations of the Compassionate Contact program. To participate Veterans must receive a referral from their VA clinician.

According to its website The Beryl Institute’s PX Innovation Awards provide a platform for sharing and celebrating great work across the globe to improve the human experience in health care. For information on The Beryl Institute visit www.theberylinstitute.org.

Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner have purchased neighbouring lots for custom homes in Hidden Hills the upscale LA enclave where they and their famous friends have settled in recent years.

It wasn’t clear how much the mum-and-daughter duo paid for the valuable real estate where Spears’ home once stood before being demolished.

But now Realtor records show that they dropped a combined $47.1 million (US$37M) for the 3.4-acre property near the edge of the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve in late December.

Khloé paid $21.7 million (US$17M) for a 1.86-acre lot on the same date her mum/manager purchased a $25.5 million (US$20M) 1.53-acre corner lot next door The Post reports.

They purchased it from an LLC registered to a small development company called Metro Development Homes records show.

Reportedly $36.1 million (US$28.3M) of that cash is going directly to construction and development costs since the land is assessed at (and was listed for) less than $11.5 million (US$9M).

What could the houses possibly include to cost that much?

Meanwhile Khloé’s house which she reportedly purchased with her boyfriend NBA star Tristan Thomas clocks in around 930 sq m but not much else is known about it according to Variety.

Both properties have over-size swimming pools with cabanas pictured show and are designed in the modern farmhouse architectural style according to Variety.

The Kardashians aren’t the first celebs to grace the lot — with Britney Spears renting the former home on the property in 2011 and 2012 for $25000 a month according to the LA Times.

It was demolished after the former owner “Million Dollar Listing” star Tracy Tutor’s father Ron Tutor sold the house in 2012.

The lot has stood empty ever since and landed in the hands of the now-defunct Ponzi scheme the Woodbridge Group before being sold to Metro Development.

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 979 that requires public companies headquartered in California to diversify their governing boards with directors from underrepresented communities by the end of 2021.

With four new board members in tow — two women and two Black men — the Manhattan Beach-based electric vehicle-maker was already compliant with the new law.



The newcomers were Wendy Greuel former Los Angeles City Controller; Roderick Randall a co-founder of Boston-based Vesbridge Partners; Nadine Watt chairwoman of the Los Angeles Business Council; and Mark Hickson an executive vice president of corporate development strategy quality and integration at Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc.



The automaker has since added William McDermott chief executive of ServiceNow Inc. a software company based in Santa Clara and Mitch Zuklie chief executive of San Francisco-based law firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. The eight-member board also includes company’s two co-founders Chief Executive Henrik Fisker and his wife Chief Financial Officer Geeta Gupta-Fisker.



“We have a phenomenal board” said Randall who’s also an early investor in the automaker. “At any time they all bring different perspectives so when we have a discussion you get all these different backgrounds and angles and thought processes. I’m just delighted to be a part of the group and to be honest with you I pinch myself half the time.”



Other local companies are following suit adding to their boards individuals who self-identify as Black African American Hispanic Latino Asian Pacific Islander Native American Native Hawaiian Alaska Native or as members of the LGBTQ community.





Board additions



Playa Vista-based Honest Co. Inc. which in May raised $413 million in an initial public offering for a market value of about $1.45 billion last month added James White and Susan Gentile to its board of directors.



White is the former president and chief executive of Atlanta-based Jamba Inc. while Gentile serves as chief financial and administrative officer at H.I.G. Capital Management in Miami.



“James and Susan’s diverse expertise are a welcome addition to our board of directors” Honest Co. co-founder and Chief Creative Officer Jessica Alba said in a statement.



“As our company continues to expand our reach across categories in the clean space the background they will bring to Honest will help ensure we continue to reflect the needs and wants of our consumers and the communities we serve in all that we do” Alba added.



Santa Monica-based Counter Brands which sold a majority stake to Carlyle Group Inc. last month in a deal that valued it at $1 billion in January added Dasha Smith to its board of directors its fifth female member. Smith is chief administrative officer for the National Football League.



Santa Monica-based internet services company Leaf Group Ltd. which is set to be acquired by Virginia-based media conglomerate Graham Holdings Co. in a deal valued at $323 million appointed Harold Logan to its board in November. Logan a Harvard University graduate served as chief executive at BuyBook Technologies Inc. prior to its acquisition by AutoTrader Inc. in 2014.



LiveXLive Media Inc. a West Hollywood-based company that specializes in streaming live events and original shows announced on May 3 that Kris Wright vice president of Nike Inc.’s global men’s footwear lifestyle product will join its board of directors. Wright is also an appointed member of the Executive Leadership Council a national organization of Black CEOs.

He's been one he says for years — New Balance Reebok Adidas he likes them all though Nike is his favourite.

But despite his interest there's one thing missing for the 19-year-old: access.

""That's really the struggle … just finding something that fits over the orthopedic"" he said.

Lingard has arthrogryposis a condition which restricts joints mobility and causes muscle weakness. That makes finding shoes in the right size difficult as is manoeuvring them around the braces he wears on his legs.

Those difficulties Lingard said aren't uncommon for people with disabilities. So when Nike announced the release of the newest version of their FlyEase shoe — which allows the wearer to put it on without bending over or even using their arms at all — he knew he needed a pair.

Louie Lingard 19 said he was disappointed by the rollout of Nike's FlyEase shoes. 'They should have been held to a higher standard knowing that people could benefit from it' he said. (Submitted by Louie Lingard)

But though the Go FlyEase was touted by design lead Sarah Reinersten as a shoe ""for everybody"" Lingard said it seems the opposite is true. While the shoe could have done the most good for the disabled community instead it was released in limited quantities and snatched up by resellers.

""I was very excited to see them adding that inclusiveness to their shoes"" he said. ""It was huge for me. And it was really a big disappointment when I saw the way that it rolled out.""

Lingard soon took to TikTok to post about the irony of an accessible shoe becoming inaccessible to the community who would benefit from it the most. In the video which quickly went viral he explained how difficult it is for those with actual mobility issues to acquire the shoe.

And in interview with CBC he and others spoke of how the situation highlights issues unique to the adaptive fashion industry — and the people who depend on it.

WATCH | Adaptive sneaker released in limited quantities snatched up by resellers:

Nike’s new shoe highlights boom in adaptive fashion Duration 2:12 The scarcity of the Nike Go FlyEase has members of the disabled community frustrated and underlines the now booming industry of adaptive fashion.

'Really universal' but resold at $500 US

Adaptive fashion means designing apparel for people with reduced mobility range of motion or other disabilities.

In advertising the Go FlyEase Nike didn't use the word ""disabled"" or specifically market toward the community — despite the fact that it was originally designed with them in mind.

""The original concept around the shoe was to support our adaptive athletes better"" designer Haley Toelle said in a press video announcing the shoe's release. ""We just quickly throughout the process found that the shoe was really universal.""

And the first version of the FlyEase which still required the wearer to use a zipper around the back of the shoe were specifically inspired by Matthew Walzer . Walzer a student athlete found it difficult to tie shoes as due to cerebral palsy he only had flexibility in one hand.

WATCH | What's behind the Nike Go FlyEase design:

But Lingard said the current iteration of the shoe has strayed far from its origins. By treating the shoe the same way Nike treats their other releases prices have skyrocketed with the only available pairs now going for upwards of $500 US.

Releasing shoes in a limited quantity to gauge interest — or drive demand — isn't a unique strategy. Lingard said many shoe companies employ similar techniques when introducing a new line Nike included.

He says that shouldn't have been the strategy here.

""I think with the shoe they should have been held to a higher standard knowing that people could benefit from it.""

That's because regardless of what Nike calls it Lingard said the shoe is an example of adaptive fashion.

In a statement to CBC News a Nike spokesperson said the response to the Go FlyEase has been ""incredibly positive"" though ""overwhelming demand"" has made it impossible for them to distribute the shoe widely.

The spokesperson said more units will be available later this year and pointed to other shoes in the FlyEase collection currently available on their website. These other shoes — such as the Air Max 90 and Revolution 5 — feature adaptive designs like collapsible heels and zippers but lack the ""tensioner"" that secures the Go FlyEase to a wearer's foot.

Nike says the Go FlyEase's 'tensioner' allows the wearer to put the shoe on hands-free and perform 'an action many might take for granted (kicking-off a shoe).' Lingard and others see it as a significant upgrade when compared to other accessible footwear which makes its scarcity particularly frustrating. (Nike)

Burgeoning world of adaptive fashion

Like Lingard Canadian fashion designer Izzy Camilleri was disappointed by Nike's rollout but believes there is a silver lining to the shoe's introduction.

Camilleri who has designed wardrobes for such names as David Bowie Angelina Jolie Daniel Radcliffe and Meryl Streep shifted focus from high fashion to adaptive clothing in 2005 after Toronto Star reporter Barbara Turnbull asked her to design outfits she could wear while working in a wheelchair.

People who use a wheelchair Camilleri explained can have different requirements for clothing design — whether they are made to be easier to put on or simply fall in a way that is comfortable to wear while seated.

But despite the fact that the global market for adaptive fashion and apparel could reach $349.9 billion by 2023 according to research and advisory firm Coresight Research  Camilleri said most people aren't even aware it exists.

Designer Izzy Camilleri who has clothed celebrity A-listers like Angelina Jolie David Bowie and Meryl Streep moved to adaptive fashion in 2005. (Maayan Ziv)

""Even the people that need it don't even realize the options that are out there"" Camilleri said. ""So there's this education piece that we're constantly having to work on.""

On top of that Camilleri said there are added hurdles to advertising adaptive clothing.

In 2018 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development alleged advertisers used Facebook's ad platform to unlawfully restrict which users receive housing-related ads — including people with a disabilities. Soon after Facebook removed over 5000 targeting options to help prevent misuse and also required all advertisers to comply with their non-discrimination policy.

Since then adaptive fashion retailers — including Camilleri — have said their ads can be identified as discriminatory simply for targeting people with disabilities or showing medical devices.

""When we're putting up posts they constantly get taken down until we get it right"" Camilleri said.

That can inhibit the ability for them to reach clients and spread awareness that adaptive fashion even exists.

So while advertisements that marketed the Go FlyEase specifically as adaptive fashion would have been ideal marketing it for everyone may increase knowledge about it — which could bolster the field Camilleri said.

""Maybe Nike could have approached it differently but the whole accessible and adaptive market is still young"" she said. ""And it's really challenging. It's really really really hard.""

Gradual widespread change

While the market is young more and more big brands are making forays into it. Along with Nike Tommy Hilfiger has an entire adaptive collection as does American shoe and clothing retailer Zappos.

Christina Mallon — chief brand officer of Open Style Lab a nonprofit that helps design adaptive fashion for people with disabilities — said she applauds all brands that embrace adaptive fashion including Nike.

When she was 22 Mallon's arms became paralyzed due to motor neuron disease. She said since then she's had to come up with creative ways to accomplish seemingly simple tasks as ""the world was not created with disabled people in mind.""

So to see the gradual shift of adaptive fashion becoming more common she says is heartening. Fashion has ignored problems that disabled people have to deal with every day she said so seeing technology like the Go FlyEase marketed as an option for everyone could suggest more widespread change.

Christina Mallon chief brand officer of non-profit Open Style Lab says that brands' forays into the world of adaptive fashion is a positive thing — even if it is gradual. (Oyediran Bamigboye)

""People don't understand how hard buttons are for people with limited dexterity Mallon said as an example. ""But why are buttons still the same way they are? Why can't buttons just be magnets? … I think designers need to ask themselves those questions.""

Still she said the fact that the Go FlyEase sold out so quickly — and likely not to people with disabilities — is a cause for concern. Moving forward they could rectify that mistake by giving first access to restocks to non-profits that represent people with disabilities or open-source the shoe technology so people can create it on their own.

Whatever happens with this shoe adapting the world to make it more accessible is vital says Mallon. Because regardless of your current level of mobility that is likely to change as time goes on.

""Every single person will become disabled at some point in their lives"" Mallon said. ""So even if you don't care about people with disabilities you'll become disabled at some point in your life so you should care.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9uaWtlLXpvb214LXZhcG9yZmx5LW5leHQtMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 review,"The Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 were born for running and running fast.

One-minute review

Running in the Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 for the first time will bring an extra spring to your step. With every footstrike the generous 40mm of Nike's ZoomX foam underfoot and full length carbon footplate give noticeable extra propulsion over a traditional running shoe.

The energy return is really impressive. So much so it could well be an entirely new sensation that you haven't experienced before – even walking in them initially feels rather peculiar.

However once you're running and have clocked a few dozen kilometers to adapt to this new feel underfoot you may well be hooked on some new found speed.

Other notable features include offset laces distinctive protruding point at the back of the sole wider than normal toe box and highly breathable knitted mesh upper. We found them good straight out of the box for a 15km run.

Your feet are really well connected and secure in the shoe with no rubbing and this continued to be the case throughout testing. They're great looking too so be prepared for some envious glances from other runners as you pass them by.

These shoes follow in the footsteps of the highly popular Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% but at $250 / £209.95 / $310.00 they're a little cheaper while benefiting from the same speedy sole configuration.

The Nike ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT% 2 were released in 2021 and are available in a wide variety of global markets.

Design

At 206g the Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 might not be the lightest racer out there - others tip the scales at just below 200g – but they still unquestionably fall into the lightweight category.

You've got the choice of two colorways: Aurora Green/Chlorine Blue/Pale Ivory/Black which we tested here and Glacier Blue/Chile Red/Pale Ivory/Black which has a red flare if you want something more eye-catching.

Now the details and let's start with the sole – after all this is one of this shoe's biggest differentiators. With a sizable heel stack height of 40mm (World Athletics' limit) and 8mm drop there is a good chunk of Nike's very own ZoomX foam underfoot it's immensely light bouncy and soft designed to give high energy return.

There's also a full-length articulated carbon plate which brings both added energy return as well as stability and responsiveness thereby avoiding any marshmallow-type feeling that could be a factor with all this cushioning.

The outsole is largely exposed ZoomX foam with the forefoot area covered in a more durable piece of grippier black rubber plus two much smaller white strips on the edges of the heel which are slightly serrated for a touch of extra traction.

This stripped-back approach has obvious weight-saving results but a couple of obvious sacrifices would be longevity as well as grip in the wet. Don't even think about going off-road in them – they're strictly for road or track use.

The innersole appears fairly standard – there's no noticeable differences to regular ones – but it's glued and stitched in place which may or may be to your personal preference. We liked it for the one overriding benefit that it won't budge at all which can sometimes be an issue with those that aren't secured leading to rubbing and possible blisters.

It is worth noting that all of the above (i.e. the entire sole) is the same as its predecessor the ZoomX Vaporfly Next%. The difference lies in the uppers.

In Nike's quest to be lightweight and breathable the form of the shoe is almost skeletal with only features that are absolutely essential. We like this a lot.

It's made from an engineered woven mesh (different to the Next% which uses Vaporweave) – this has lots of little holes so you can see through to your socks if you look closely – plus it's relatively soft and pliable while remaining durable.This means it’s highly breathable as well as quick drying.

In terms of padding there's touch incorporated on the inside of the tongue and a much more generous 4-5mm strip placed at the top of the heel. The toe box is slightly larger too but not overly so.

The laces are brilliant – the perfect length (which is a simple thing to get right but some brands don't manage) with additional stitching that gives lots of small notches.

Each of these is a gripping point to make sure your bow is really secure and won't slip which is a really neat feature we haven't seen before. The laces are offset angled to the outside of the shoe which neatly accommodates the Nike tick and is a style statement though we're not sure if there's much performance advantage.

One final flourish of detail is some discreet wording printed on the side of the midsole reading: ""Measured in the lab verified with medals and records''. Make of that what you will.

Performance

From the moment you put them on the bounce of the ZoomX foam is unmistakable and quite impressive.

We found the 40mm stack height and bounciness took a bit of getting used to (particularly if you've been wearing a more traditional pair of shoes) – so much that it felt like slightly different muscle groups were being worked round the back of our legs and glutes.

You might feel a little stiffness the day after running in them the first few times.

They're niggle-free straight out of the box and padding and sizing are very well executed. The strip of padding on the heel cup works a treat keeping the trainer locked firmly in place totally connected to your foot.

There's plenty of room in the forefoot and your foot feels well supported by the mesh upper.

It felt like there was slightly less support on the inside of the sole of the heel which would perhaps suggest it's best avoided by under-pronaters (that is to say your ankle rolls inwards) but if you run in a more neutral style they'll be fine.

Not that we had the chance to test much in the wet but never once was there a feeling of lack of traction on the dry roads and flat surfaces they were tested on.

In terms of longevity this is likely to be limited by the ZoomX foam on the sole. How long it will retain its springiness is hard to say and the unprotected rear outsole section will show signs of wear quicker than shoes with full length rubber sole.

All in all this is a performance running shoe good for speed work and race day. It's very comfortable very well built and brilliant all round.

He had a brilliant mind and photographic memory coupled with huge empathy for his fellow man. He was born in Greensburg Pennsylvania in humble beginnings growing up in a home with six boys and no indoor plumbing.

As his 1948 high school yearbook noted when proclaiming this Class President as Most Likely to Succeed “Our tall senior president really has a bundle of brains inside that blond head of his. Glenn has made a name for himself as one of our star basketball players.” Not content to limit himself to one sport while still in high school he was recruited by the Vandergrift Pioneers of the Middle Atlantic League the farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies pitching with a winning record against notables such as Whitey Ford eventually turning down an offer from the Boston Red Sox. He chose instead to pursue higher education at Pennsylvania State University graduating with a BS in Chemical Engineering. In 1952 he married his college sweetheart Joanne Barnett the mother of his two children Robyn and Eric.

Shortly after graduation he joined the research division of the Standard Oil Co. (SOHIO) and was quickly identified as a high potential employee serving as Secretary of the Research Committee of the Board of Directors. Glenn’s interest in and knowledge of the petroleum industry was broadened by subsequent assignments in departments as varied as operations research managing fuel cell programs running the coal and uranium businesses promoting chemicals biotechnology and emerging materials in R&D. While working full time he completed his MS from the Case Institute of Technology in 1954 followed by his PhD in Chemical Engineering in 1958. He rose to the role of Senior Vice President Technology and Planning and member of the Board of Directors. His responsibilities included R&D Engineering Patent and Licensing Strategic Planning Alternate Energy and Health Safety and Environment.

At Standard Oil Glenn promoted corporate policies which were far before their time involving individual performance goals high standards professionalism and diversity. One example is the high number of women and minorities that were employed under his watch. Management practices such as part-time work for women and corporate compensation for educational advancement were common. He was always fair and inclusive. SOHIO was widely recognized as a leading corporate citizen and good place to work under Glenn’s leadership. He was noted for his walks through the research labs and corporate offices taking time always to greet and chat with everyone he encountered. For his retirement party from SOHIO the theme was “My Way” by Frank Sinatra – he was respected and admired for sticking to his principles and always leading in his way.

Glenn took early retirement upon acquisition of The Standard Oil Company by British Petroleum in 1986. Retirement was not in his vocabulary and he moved immediately to the academic realm as Director of Strategic Planning at Case Western Reserve University. He led the effort to merge the faculties of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve College; the Schools had been federated 20 years earlier but still retained separate alumni groups athletics and academic departments. He became the first Dean of the Colleges of the combined faculties. He then became Vice Provost for Corporate Research and Technology Transfer working with industry and venture capitalists to exploit CWRU research findings.

After another failed attempt at retirement he was nominated by the OHIO Business Roundtable to become the first formal Science and Technology Advisor to Governor George Voinovich in 1996. He stayed on in this role under Governor Bob Taft writing the whitepaper “Competing on Knowledge” which became the justification of the establishment for the Third Frontier Program. He used the technology action funds as a catalyst for enhancing research activities across Ohio universities.

Glenn then went on to become President of the Generation Foundation whose mission was to fund and promote economic development projects that were collaborative and allied to Cleveland’s strategic plan. Examples are BioEnterprise and the Opportunity Corridor.

No recounting of Glenn’s life would be complete without mentioning the 20+ non-profits on whose boards he served including United Way American Red Cross Cleveland Clinic Innovations Advisory Board Greater Cleveland Literacy Coalition Cleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program Industrial Advisory Board at MetroHealth and the Campaign Committee for CWRU.

In addition to the corporate Board of The Standard Oil Company he was on the boards of Centran Bank Society National Bank Ferro Corp and Nordson Corp lending his many talents to better our region.

He was SOHIO’s appointee to the Board of the Playhouse Square Foundation in 1980 when it appeared that the theatres were nearing demolition. Following their preservation and resurgence he became their Chairman of the Board serving in that capacity for 5 years calling the hiring of Art Falco as President and CEO one of his proudest accomplishments with the Board. He received the President’s Award from Playhouse Square in 2013 and is a life member of the Board.

He received many awards and honors during his life including the highest form of recognition from Penn State University the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1984. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Kent State University and Cleveland State University; the President’s Award for Distinguished Alumni from the Case School of Engineering; the Distinguished Service Award from the Cleveland Technical Societies Council and the Peter Berg Regional Leadership Award from TeamNEO.

He was a passionate fan of Penn State football and also loved playing golf. He was a champion at table tennis and also at duplicate bridge . He was a master at crossword puzzles and jigsaw puzzles where he used his perpetually curious mind to complete any challenge laid in front of him with impressive speed. It’s worth noting that his crossword puzzles were always done in ink. Glenn had impeccable penmanship with a very low tolerance for errors in spelling and punctuation.

In 1987 he married life-long friend and co-worker Jeanette Grasselli. Together they shared travels to over 100 countries annual visits to the Cayman Islands numerous rounds of golf and attended countless music dance and theater events across the region. They were devoted to each other.

Glenn will be remembered for his support of public/private partnerships as well as industrial/academic collaborations.

Throughout his professional career and personal life Glenn served modestly but with intense desire to help others and to always strive for excellence. He was an exemplary and visionary leader and his efforts have made a significant impact across all areas of our community. He was a generous kind intelligent human being – he will be truly missed.

NSC,Norfolk Southern Railway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLWFhYjdkMzA4NGE4ZDE3ZDhkNzIxZDJjYjc1MGJlMzIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US rail industry defends safety record amid staffing cuts,"OMAHA Neb. (AP) — Even as railroads are operating longer and longer freight trains that sometimes stretch for miles the companies have drastically reduced staffing levels prompting unions to warn that moves meant to increase profits could endanger safety and even result in disasters.

More than 22% of the jobs at railroads Union Pacific CSX and Norfolk Southern have been eliminated since 2017 when CSX implemented a cost-cutting system called Precision Scheduled Railroading that most other U.S. railroads later copied. BNSF the largest U.S. railroad and the only one that hasn’t expressly adopted that model has still made staff cuts to improve efficiency and remain competitive.

The railroads acknowledge they have cut staff lengthened trains and made other adjustments to reduce spending but they are adamant none of the changes increase dangers. Regulators at the Federal Railroad Administration say they are tracking the changes and that the data so far does not show the new operating model is unsafe. But unions counter that with the stakes so high any time a train derails the new system is risky.

“Every time the wheels come off the rail it’s kind of like buying a lottery ticket to the big disaster” said Jason Cox with the carmen division of the Transportation Communications Union.

Precision Scheduled Railroading calls for running fewer longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. The railroads also operate their trains on more of a set schedule now with fewer stops and pickups and they have eliminated shorter less-profitable routes.

By increasing the length of trains railroads can reduce total trips cut down on the number of engines and railcars needing maintenance and manage with fewer employees. Some trains now stretch longer than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers). Union Pacific said the average of its maximum train length has grown more than 30% to 9250 feet which is 1.75 miles (2.8 kilometers) since it started using the new operating model in 2018 and the railroad is expanding track sidings throughout its network to accommodate much longer trains.

The railroads say they abide by federal regulations for car and signal inspections and that human inspections are supplemented by high-tech systems that can scan tracks and railcars for defects.

They also say safety has improved overall over the past five years. All the major railroads issued statements defending their safety records and citing investments they have made in their networks.

“Across the board I do not see evidence of our workforce at Union Pacific being rushed overworked or put in harm’s way. I just don’t see it statistically” said Lance Fritz CEO of Union Pacific the nation’s second-largest railroad.

CSX officials said most of the key safety measures they track like employee injuries and train accidents have improved since it started using the Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model.

“We do not move freight at the expense of the safety of our employees or the communities where we operate” CSX spokeswoman Cindy Schild said.

The head of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio last week asked the Government Accountability Office to study Precision Scheduled Railroading’s impact on safety and the industry overall.

Independent expert David Clarke director of the University of Tennessee’s Center for Transportation Research said the safety data is inconclusive.

“Right now I just haven’t seen anything to demonstrate that it’s definitely having a negative impact on safety” Clarke said.

However the union coalition Transportation Trades Department notes the amount of time carmen have to inspect each car in a train has been reduced by more than half — from three minutes to just 60 seconds. Also staffing cuts mean less-trained train crews are often handling those inspections the group says.

“From the conductor side we’re basically finding things that are just obvious” said Greg Hynes national legislative director with SMART-TD union that represents conductors.

The unions also say that most signalmen who maintain railroad crossing guards and safety signals along the rails have seen their territories grow by 150% leaving little time for maintenance work once required tests are completed.

“As maintenance gets neglected. then obviously the failures go up” said Tim Tarrant a vice president with the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen.

Overtime is also up which the unions say increases fatigue and the chance that a safety defect could be missed.

Unions acknowledge it’s part of their mission to maintain or increase staffing levels but members said they’re more motivated by the potential for disasters such as a 2013 derailment in Canada that killed 47 people in the town of Lac Megantic and caused millions of dollars in damage or a 2005 derailment in Graniteville South Carolina where nine people were killed and more than 250 treated for exposure to toxic chlorine gases.

Former CSX employee Kasondra Bird said safety concerns led her to resign in December after 24 years with the railroad even though she didn’t have another job lined up. As a conductor operating trains by remote control in a Grand Rapids Michigan railyard she went from switching 150 cars a day to 300 to 350 each shift.

Bird said some workers skipped meal and bathroom breaks to keep up.

“I was hoping to stay a lot longer but if it means my safety it’s not going to do me any good staying another day if that means I’m not going to come home” said Bird who is a 45-year-old single mother. “Safety and the well being of employees have definitely taken a backseat to production.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3JvYW5va2UuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbnJ2LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1yYWlsLW5leHQtc3RlcHMtbm90LWxpa2VseS10by1pbmNsdWRlLXN0YXRpb24tbmVhci1jaHJpc3RpYW5zYnVyZy1hcXVhdGljLWNlbnRlci9hcnRpY2xlXzcwMTc1OTcyLWI0ZmItMTFlYi1hYTRmLTJmZDEyODZkNTc1Yi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NRV passenger rail: Next steps not likely to include station near Christiansburg Aquatic Center,"New River Valley residents can now look forward to no longer having to drive to Roanoke to catch a train to Washington D.C. and beyond but key particulars of the passenger rail plan are not yet on the tracks.

One matter is where a New River Valley station will be located.

Work led by the New River Valley Regional Commission recommended some years ago a spot near the Christiansburg Aquatic Center off of North Franklin Street and the town bought land in that area primarily for that purpose. But a few people close to the passenger rail extension project now say it’s highly unlikely that will happen.

The state’s approximately $257 million investment into the Western Rail Initiative—the program that covers the planned return of passenger rail to the New River Valley and the upcoming addition of another train from Roanoke to Washington D.C.—includes the acquisition of right of way and track from Norfolk Southern Railway for just under 29 miles of the Virginian Line from the Salem Crossovers to Merrimac.

The New River Valley station will be on the old Virginian Line and not on the Norfolk Southern Mainline which are the tracks near the Christiansburg Aquatic Center Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation spokeswoman Haley Glynn wrote in an email this past week.

“The exact station location and routes are still subject to environmental study planning and definitive agreements” she wrote. “Due to ongoing negotiations that’s all the information we can provide at this time.”

Christiansburg Mayor Mike Barber said he knew a few months ago a station near the Aquatic Center was unlikely but he remained tight-lipped due to the ongoing negotiations between the state and Norfolk Southern. He said he understands that one hurdle with a station near the Aquatic Center is interference with the rail company’s freight line.

Barber has also pointed to some topography challenges.

“I never thought the aquatic center site was the best site because of ingress and grading work required” he wrote in an email. “I felt the costs involved would be [too] high.”

Further Barber wrote that the site was recommended by the local passenger rail group long before the idea of using the Virginian line came into existence. The mayor however wrote the town will be involved in working with DRPT the Virginia Department of Transportation and other agencies to determine possible sites.

One key reason the Christiansburg site was recommended is its centrality to the area and convenient access for the bulk of the anticipated ridership said Larry Hincker spokesman for the group behind much of the campaign to return passenger rail to the New River Valley. The site was also recommended due to its relative access to roadways or in this case the North Franklin Street thoroughfare that provides a direct link to the Blacksburg and Christiansburg downtown areas he said.

“That’s more or less the heart of the New River Valley roadway wise and population density wise” Hincker said.

Barber maintains that Christiansburg in general remains the logical location.

Previous research has found that most passengers would come from either Blacksburg or Christiansburg.

Christiansburg spent just under $400000 a few years ago to buy the eight acres near the aquatic center but town officials said at the time the land would be used for additional parking for the swimming facility should a train station not be built there.

Barber said the town already paved space for overflow parking on some of the acquired land. But he said a big reason the town bought the land was to show that it would be ready to accommodate passenger rail operations.

“We set the tone and bought the land to show we had a commitment to getting passenger rail to this area” he said.

Another key component that will need to be finalized is the exact makeup and functions of the New River Valley Passenger Rail Station Authority an entity expected to include representation from various localities and agencies across the New River Valley.

The organization will allow a number of regional partners to share in the cost of building and maintaining a train station but the specifics on that still need to be worked out officials close to the rail project say.

“Our agency will help guide the authority through formation” Kevin Byrd executive director of the New River Valley Regional Commission wrote in an email. “We are not convening potential members until more information comes from the state. There are a lot more details needed before local governments/higher ed institutions can begin making commitments that an authority would entail.”

Overall officials are praising the agreement to return passenger rail to the region. Barber said the area is far closer to the objective than it was a few years ago.

The infrastructure improvements necessitated by the project are expected to be complete by 2025 according to the recently announced plans. Afterward two Northeast Corridor round trips will be extended from Roanoke to Christiansburg.

“Obviously we were elated that the state has been able to strike a preliminary agreement with Norfolk Southern” Hincker said. “It’s one more indication of the state’s seriousness about passenger rail and their ability to make robust investment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYmlybWluZ2hhbS16b28td2VsY29tZXMtcmVkLXBhbmRhLWluZmFudC1ob3dsZXItbW9ua2V5L2FydGljbGVfODZiMDk5NWItMTAyZC01MmQ5LWExNjctMWIxYmI2MWM5NTViLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Birmingham Zoo welcomes red panda infant howler monkey,"Memphis TN (38111)

In this article we take a look at recent research which investigates who might be more susceptible to multiple sclerosis and why that might be.

Around the world MS diagnoses are on the increase. Multiple sclerosis is most common in Northern Europe North America Australia and New Zealand. These countries have majority populations of Nordic and European heritage leading to suggestions that there is a link between MS prevalence and 'Viking genes'. However these countries share other factors such as similar diets lifestyle obesity rates and industrialisation. Countries in the Middle East and South Asia have reported rising MS prevalence alongside increasing adoption of 'Western lifestyles' and there are similar demyelinating conditions that are common in East Asia and South America. It's easy to forget that genetic diversity in humans doesn't just mean skin colour. Most genetic diversity is not something you can see when you look at a person - it's the highly variable pattern of proteins on the surface of your cells known as your haplotype. Researchers have identified dozens of haplotypes that are associated with a higher risk of developing MS. Many of these are more common in Europe and Scandinavia than elsewhere but they are not restricted to people of European or Scandinavian ethnicity. Of course genetic susceptibility is only part of the picture. Most people with susceptible haplotypes never develop MS. Researchers think that there is likely to be a trigger that sets off the chain of events in your body that leads to multiple sclerosis. The most likely triggers are some kind of environmental factor like your diet smoking vitamin D levels viral infection or local air quality. For environmental triggers your personal risk is based on where you grew up not your ethnicity. People who move between countries as adults retain the risk profile of the place they lived as children. Their children and grandchildren take the risk profile of the place that they grow up irrespective of their ethnic heritage. So if there is a link between MS and countries with 'Western' lifestyles then it is shared by everyone who lives there whatever their ethnic heritage.

Does MS affect ethnic groups differently?

Researchers have been concerned for some time that MS affects people differently which might lead to inequalities of health care. A recent study in London showed that there was a higher prevalence and incidence of MS in White people than Black and South Asian people. However once diagnosed other studies have shown that Black people in both the UK and US are likely to notice their MS progress faster and become more disabled at a younger age than White people. The Marmot Review published last year reported on the impact of social inequality on health in the last decade. As the report makes clear ‘Inequalities in health arise because of inequalities in society – in the conditions in which people are born grow live work and age’. Social inequalities can affect people’s trust and engagement with medicine and the quality of the care they get. We have seen this during the pandemic where people from some ethnic groups have been more at risk of severe disease but also less likely to receive vaccines. A lack of awareness of MS within some ethnic groups coupled with delays in seeking medical advice or delays in referral to specialists could result in a delay in diagnosis. This may explain the worse outcomes for Black people with MS – they are further along their MS journey when they reach the neurologist. Different MS symptoms are more common in different groups of people too. Cognition problems are seen more often in Black people with MS than other people with MS. Although rates of optic neuritis are similar in Black and White people with MS for Black people it tends to be more severe and cause greater visual disability. And then there is the overall impact of MS on employment and everyday life. Unemployment rates in the US are higher in Black people with MS than in White people with MS. People in some ethnic groups both here and in the US may be more likely to be employed in physically demanding jobs such as hospitality health or social care. As a result if they are affected by disability in MS they are more likely to have to retire or leave work. Someone who is able to pay for exercise classes and can afford additional medicines and healthy food is less likely to experience disability progression in MS. Where people have a reduced income due to unemployment this has a direct impact on how well they can live with MS. Although financial inequality can affect everyone people from Black and other ethnic groups may be more likely to be pushed into poverty by MS.

Should MS be treated differently in different ethnic groups?

A recent study from the US found that Black people with MS were more likely to have adverse reactions to beta interferon DMDs and they were less likely to do well on tablet based DMDs. The same study showed that White people tend to find that glatiramer acetate is less effective for them than it is for Black or Asian people. MS is an unpredictable condition. When you and your neurologist discuss the best disease modifying drug (DMD) for you you are both trying to balance the risks of the DMD against the risk of you experiencing severe MS related disability. 'Watch and wait' has been a fairly common approach to MS treatment in the past but if your ethnicity means you are more likely to progress faster then you might prefer to move to more effective treatment options sooner.

What next?

MS affects everyone differently making it harder to spot these trends. However the good news is that researchers are now looking directly at health inequality among people with MS across the UK aiming to ensure that everyone gets the health services and support that they need. The aim is to ensure that every health professional working in MS understands the impact of inequality in MS and how to combat it. We are doing our part to shine a light on inequalities in MS care and to ensure that the voices of all people with MS are heard. Trishna a person living with MS says: ""There are lots of factors that can influence someone’s overall chances of better outcomes following a diagnosis of MS and we can’t ignore that someone’s ethnicity might be one of them. Whether that’s because of genetics cultural influences that can make it harder to manage the disease and/or socio-economic factors that are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups. As a British Asian living with MS I think it’s really important that research is being conducted so we can unpick these various threads and optimise personalised and holistic support for everyone living with the condition. One of the questions I asked when I was diagnosed was simply “How many other Asians in the UK live with MS”? Nobody could tell me. Even now there is limited data available. Let’s continue this conversation so we can find out the answers!""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vdG9wLWthbm55d29vZC1zdGFycy13aXRoLW1vc3QtaW5zdGFncmFtLWZvbGxvd2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Kannywood stars with most Instagram followers,"Instagram is fast becoming a good avenue for entertainers to engage their fans.

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYWx0ZXJuYXRlLWhpc3RvcnktamV0LWFsbW9zdC1zdG9wcGVkLWYtMjItZXhpc3RpbmctMTg1MzI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alternate History: This Jet Almost Stopped the F-22 from Existing,"Why was the F-22 chosen given Northrop’s stealth technology expertise with platforms such as the B-2?

Here's What You Need to Know: Northrop’s YF-23 may not have been far behind given that the Air Force initially chose both Lockheed and Northrop proposals to build the aircraft. Perhaps both jets could operate at “supercruise” speeds meaning they could achieve prolonged supersonic flight missions without needing its afterburners.

The U.S. Air Force chose to build the F-22 in the 1980s following an extensive and thorough competition a process that appears to have led to the engineering of the most dominant air-to-air platform in the world.

Interestingly there were several other competitors also seeking to build the jet and meet the Air Force’s supercruise thrust stealth and survivability requirements.

In 1986 the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman development deals offering each team 50-months to build and demonstrate a prototype. Lockheed built the YF-22 and Northrop built the YF-23 stealth fighter. Lockheed won a production contract in 1991.

Why was the F-22 chosen given Northrop’s stealth technology expertise with platforms such as the B-2?

There may be many reasons for this most of which are likely not available. Renderings of the YF-23 show a very sleek stealthy-looking airplane. Both the YF-22 and YF-23 had dual-engine exhaust pipes and a blended wing-body configuration. The YF-23 wings looked slightly larger and more diamond-shaped. The exhaust pipe cavities on the YF-23 were slightly more angular. The F-22 fuselage has a greater degree of wing-body blending and a longer more gradual horizontal slope across the top whereas the main fuselage of the YF-23 is slightly more protruded from the wings.

Does this mean that a more angular less-sloped external configuration made the YF-23 less stealthy? After all vertical structures of any kind particularly those which protrude with any kind of angle or larger shape differential might be more susceptible to a radar return signal and therefore possibly be more detectable to enemy air-defense radar. In many respects however images of the two prototypes reveal interesting similarities. Any margin of difference may or may not have been greatly impactful however the F-22 fuselage does look more horizontal and blended.

Whatever the reason the Air Force chose Lockheed YF-22 the experience of engineering the stealth fighter undoubtedly contributed to Northrop’s fighter-jet-construction expertise. It may have informed some elements of Northrop’s design for its B-21 Raider or even contributed to work on a 6th-gen stealth fighter if in fact Northrop has built a prototype for the well-known Next-Generation Air Dominance program. While this is not known as no vendor has officially confirmed the existence of a prototype 6th-Gen plane the Air Force has announced that it has flown one.

The air dominance superiority of the F-22 continues to inspire current Air Force efforts to modernize the stealth fighter and support its plan to fly it quite possibly all the way until 2060. This is being accomplished with software-driven weapons upgrades stealth coating improvements communications enhancements and a new generation of radars and sensors for the fighter. Most of all this is likely the case given the widespread consensus that the F-22 is simply unparalleled in terms of performance speed maneuverability and dogfighting capability.

Northrop’s YF-23 may not have been far behind given that the Air Force initially chose both Lockheed and Northrop proposals to build the aircraft. Perhaps both jets could operate at “supercruise” speeds meaning they could achieve prolonged supersonic flight missions without needing its afterburners. This of course massively extends mission effectiveness overall speed time to target and dwell time enabling greater target acquisition as well.

They don’t like that because well they generally don’t come equipped with the hardware that would allow them to safely fly in a shared environment.

Such hardware is generally known as sense and avoid and it is designed to do exactly that: detect what’s happening around the drone and if need be move it out of the way autonomously to avoid collisions.Military drones don’t usually come with sense and avoid simply because up until now they’ve been lone killer wolves raining death and electronic surveillance from above. But as the needs and expectations of the military shift they’ll kind of have to mingle.With that in mind the U.S. Navy Northrop Grumman  and a joint venture between L3Harris and Thales called Aviation Communications & Surveillance Systems (ACSS) have been working for the past five years in coming up with a decent sense and avoid system.The technology is meant for the MQ-4C Triton autonomous drone and if successful it will allow the machine not only to fly alongside other aircraft but also take off and land “out of almost any airfield or airport in the world in full compliance with current and emerging aviation regulations around the globe.”The Triton had its first flight in 2013 and just a small number of them are currently deployed by the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. Derived from the Global Hawk  it was designed with a wide range of missions in mind from maritime ISR patrol signals intelligence search and rescue and communications relay.The main thing going for this drone is the fact that it can stay in the air for 24 hours at a time an altitudes of more than 10 miles (16 km) and can cover distances of up to 9400 miles (15100 km).The companies involved did not say how long it will be before the prototype of the system will be ready for testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvZGVwaW5rLm9yZy8wNTE2MjAyMV9ibGFja3JvY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock Shareholders Protest Planning Meeting - CODEPINK - Women for Peace,"Join CODEPINK as we plan our All Eyes on BlackRock Protest!

While CODEPINK has an ongoing campaign urging BlackRock to divest from all weapon manufacturers this year we also ask that BlackRock support human rights for this shareholder season.

WHEN: Sunday May 16th at 3PM EST

WHERE: Zoom

BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager controlling more than $5 trillion in assets globally. BlackRock released a statement indicating that it would like companies to implement and disclose their human rights processes to identify manage and prevent adverse human rights impacts. But yet BlackRock is one of the largest shareholders of Tasers manufacturer Axon enterprise and has $7.25 billion invested in Boeing $3.3 billion in General Dynamics $5.6 billion in Lockheed Martin $3.4 billion in Northrop Grumman and $4 billion in Raytheon. Weapons made by these companies are being used in Palestine Syria Iraq Yemen and other places around the world where the US continues to be involved in active conflicts. As you can see even though BlackRock said it would like companies to implement human rights processes they continue to profit from war. BlackRock even has an iShares fund that exclusively benefits from weapons of war.

At this planning meeting for the upcoming May 25th protest of the BlackRock Shareholders meeting we’ll update everyone on some working plans including introducing our speakers and musicians as well as thinking through run-of-day logistics and roles for the day of the protest.

The test shown in the image below was the last check on the sprawling telescope's moving parts under space-like conditions. James Webb set to launch in Oct. 2021 is the largest most powerful space telescope ever built. It's the next generation of space telescope furthering the legendary observations made by the aging over 30-year old Hubble telescope.

After launching into space Webb's 18 hexagonal mirrors will align to form a ""single precise mirror"" NASA engineer Lee Feinberg said in a statement. ""The primary mirror is a technological marvel"" Feinberg said.

""The primary mirror is a technological marvel.""

For perspective about the size of the mirror two engineers are seen in the bottom right of the photo which was snapped at a Northrop Grumman testing control room in Southern California. (The telescope's overall design and construction however is a collaboration between NASA ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.)

James Webb named after NASA's leader between 1961 and 1968 is big for reason. Bigger mirrors capture more light and more detail. As NASA explains:

""To observe objects in the distant cosmos and to do science that’s never been done before Webb’s mirror needs to be so large that it cannot fit inside any rocket available in its fully extended form. Like a piece of origami artwork Webb contains many movable parts that have been specifically designed to fold themselves to a compact formation that is considerably smaller than when the observatory is fully deployed. This allows it to just barely fit inside a 16-foot (5-meter) rocket fairing with little room to spare.""

The $9.7 billion telescope has been hit by numerous delays and massive cost overruns for years. But it's also an unprecedented space telescope. Its foldable mirrors are some two and a half times larger than Hubble's eight-foot mirrors. The mirrors sit atop a light-blocking base called a sunshield which is about the size of a tennis court.

Crucially James Webb won't orbit Earth. The giant space telescope will orbit the sun in deeper space some 1 million miles away.

It's all happening. Even if it required patience.

""The James Webb Space Telescope is the most ambitious and complex astronomical project ever built and bringing it to life is a long meticulous process"" European Space Agency director Günther Hasinger said in a statement last year. ""The wait will be a little longer now but the breakthrough science that it will enable is absolutely worth it."""

And while it's still incredibly hard to buy any graphics card right now without shelling out for a whole gaming PC there is still steep competition between these graphics cards.

Now more than ever the right graphics card for you between these two heavyweights is going to come down to what games you plan on playing what features you're looking for and more than anything – which one you can actually find in-stock long enough to actually buy.

But if you're not sure where to even start when looking at these excellent graphics cards we'll help you pick which is the right one for your needs.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT price

In the past making a price comparison between flagship graphics cards was pretty easy – just take a look at the MSRP and call it a day but that's not quite enough anymore. While we do know the MSRP for both graphics cards – $699 (£649 about AU$950) for the RTX 3080 and $649 (likely to be £649 AU$960) for the Radeon RX 6800 XT you'd be hard-pressed to find either graphics card for that price even if you are lucky enough to find it in stock.

Even in the Newegg Shuffle that's been going up on a nearly daily basis you'll find mostly third-party versions of the RTX 3080 and Radeon RX 6800 XT with highly inflated prices. For instance the MSI RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio is currently listed on Newegg for $1149. And even at that price it's totally sold out.

If you look at a website like StockX where scalpers hawk products for higher-than-street prices you can get a pretty good idea of how much these graphics cards actually cost right now.

Just looking at the reference designs for the graphics cards the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is way more expensive with the last sale going for $2600 at the time of writing. That's nearly a $2000 increase over the MSRP. The Radeon RX 6800 XT on the other hand is still expensive but it's not as expensive. Team Red's flagship is going for just $1809 but it looks like far fewer of them have been sold through the website.

We don't condone scalping but if you are desperate enough to buy a scalped graphics card right now the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT will give much better value for the money right now. Obviously that may change in the future.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT specs

Because the RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6800 XT are built on completely different architectures you can't really make an apples to apples comparison about graphics card specs. But we're going to try anyways.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 has 8704 CUDA cores which is what Nvidia calls its shading units spread across 68 streaming multiprocessors. This is paired with 10GB of GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit bus.

The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT has 4608 shading units across 72 compute units. That's paired with 16GB of VRAM on a 256-bit bus. So on paper it looks like the Radeon RX 6800 XT is much weaker.

However the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT has a much higher clock speed and has a unique Infinity Cache that helps to more efficiently move data from the VRAM to the actual GPU. That does help with bandwidth but it's not enough to make the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT keep up with the RTX 3080 100% of the time though it can hold its own.

You probably noticed the massive difference in VRAM too and that's definitely where the Radeon RX 6800 XT pulls way ahead of the Nvidia competition. We're not quite at a point where the 6800 XT's 16GB of VRAM is totally necessary but it should give some peace of mind when thinking about games coming in the future. Keep in mind though there's really no such thing as future proofing when it comes to gaming PCs so you shouldn't base too much of your decision on what will be good 5 years down the line.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT performance

While the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 has more theoretical raw power and the Radeon RX 6800 XT has theoretically faster memory bandwidth thanks to the Infinity Cache – not to mention more memory the two graphics cards trade places depending on the game you're looking at.

Just looking at the recently-released Resident Evil Village performance the Radeon RX 6800 XT is extremely competitive with the RTX 3080 even surpassing it at 1440p with ray tracing disabled. With ray tracing enabled however the RTX 3080 takes a very substantial lead even though this game doesn't support Nvidia's performance-boosting Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology.

That gap will widen quite a bit in games that do support DLSS though and you just have to look at Cyberpunk 2077 to see it. In that game the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 nearly doubles the performance of the Radeon RX 6800 XT before enabling DLSS at 1080p. And when you enable DLSS that performance lead skyrockets to nearly 4x the framerate.

So our advice would be to look at the games you know you're going to be playing the most and think about whether or not ray tracing is something you actually care about. If you do want to turn on that eye candy you're probably going to want to go with the RTX 3080 right now.

However in pure rasterization performance the two graphics cards are incredibly close still. And especially if you can find an AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT for half the price of what an RTX 3080 is going for that similar level of non-ray tracing performance is pretty appealing.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT features

While gaming performance is likely going to be the biggest reason to buy one graphics card over another there are a ton of features that each of these graphics cards bring to the table that isn't just raw performance.

Nvidia has one of the most compelling features for our current moment where we're all working from home and it wasn't even originally pitched for that. Nvidia broadcast uses the Tensor cores in Nvidia's Ampere and Turing graphics cards to filter out background noise from your microphone and can even replace your background in a video call. So just by virtue of having an Nvidia graphics card in your PC you can get rid of a lot of distractions while telecommuting.

In contrast most of AMD's extra features still revolve primarily around gaming. One of the biggest and most recent of these is AMD Link. This will let you connect to your AMD-powered gaming PC remotely to play games or even run non-gaming programs through another PC or a smartphone. You can even let a friend link into your PC so you can play local co-op games with them even if you're anything but local.

There are plenty of features that boost performance too. Of course Nvidia has DLSS which uses AI to upscale games to give you much better performance without drastically impacting image quality. This only works in games where developers have actively implemented the technology though so you will want to make sure games support it.

AMD is working on something to compete with DLSS FidelityFX Super Resolution but it's not available yet – though it is expected sometime this year. AMD does have contrast-adaptive sharpening. CAS is basically a sharpening filter that will take colors of the scene into consideration so it doesn't look awful when running at a lower resolution. This is something that you can enable when you're say running a game at 1600p on a 4K monitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL21zaS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXRpLTEyLWdiLWFuZC1ydHgtMzA3MC10aS04Z2Itc3VwcmltLXNlcmllcy1ncHVzLWxlYWtlZC1sYW5kaW5nLWluLWp1bmUv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbXNpLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktMTItZ2ItYW5kLXJ0eC0zMDcwLXRpLThnYi1zdXByaW0tc2VyaWVzLWdwdXMtbGVha2VkLWxhbmRpbmctaW4tanVuZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB And RTX 3070 Ti 8GB ‘SUPRIM’ Series GPUs Leaked Landing In June?,"The GPU market is pretty much an imaginary unaffordable dream right now but Videocardz has recieved confirmation of even more Ampere based cards from NVIDIA. The brand new RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti series will be featured in the ""SUPRIM"" branding from MSI and include a VRAM upgrade. The RTX 3080 Ti will finally move users to a much needed 12 GB vRAM buffer (the 10 GB one on the RTX 3080 just doesn't cut it) while the RTX 3070 Ti will retain the 8GB memory buffer of the RTX 3070.

MSI RTX 3080 Ti SUPRIM and RTX 3070 SUPRIM get leaked by the paparazzi announcement in May and launching in June?

Videocardz has also leaked what appears to be the product information page of MSI's SUPRIM series and it should end the memory debate once and for all. The RTX 3080 Ti constitutes a signficiant upgrade over the RTX 3080 (it is basically a slighlty cut RTX 3090) at 10240 cores. The RTX 3070 Ti on the other hand offers a slight upgrade over the RTX 3070.

The NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti will be based on the GA104-400 GPU and hafve 6144 CUDA cores divided into 48 GPU clusters. This means it has exactly 2 more clusters than its non-Ti variant and 20 less than the RTX 3080. It will feature 48 RT cores (cor comparison the RTX 3080 has 68) which is also 2 more than the RTX 3070 and 20 less than the RTX 3080. ROPs will be 96 for this segment of NVIDIA's lineup and the clock speed is syet to be confirmed. It will feature a 256-bit memory bus with 8 GB or 16 GB GDDR6X memory clocked at 19 Gbps. It is currently scheduled for release in May 2021 alonside the RTX 3080 Ti but this could change considering the volatile supply situation.

Given below is the tweet confirming Videocard's exclusive details on the RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti:

You can use the memory ID given to trace the full specifications of the memory used:

Interestingly the RTX 3070 Ti is positioned as something of a replacement of the RTX 3070 because its not *that* powerful compared to its name sake. With just a difference of 2 GPU clusters theres only so much performance to be gained. The RTX 3080 Ti on the other hand rocks a massive difference when compared to its namesake.

The RTX 3080 Ti has 12 more GPU clusters compared to the RTX 3080 for a total of 10240 cores (2 less than the RTX 3090). It has 80 RT cores and 112 ROPs. It will be coupled with a 12 GB GDDR6X vRAM buffer and a 384-bit bus for a total of 912 GB/s. It is clearly a monster of a card and from the specifications it appears to be a very slightly less-powerful replacement of the RTX 3090 and the true flagship of NVIDIA's ampere lineup.

According to videocards the graphic cards are currently expected to be announced on May 29 with a launch expected in the first two weeks of June. It would also be very interesting to see how much NVIDIA cripples mining performance on these cards. If they manage to cripple it to a large enough extent we might just see these cards available for close to MSRP from AIB and retail partners although I wouldn't hold my brath about",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXN0ZWRyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2N0cmxhbHRkZWxldGUtd2h5LXRoZS1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNTAtbGFwdG9wcy1hcmVudC1qdXN0LWZvci1nYW1lcnMtNDEzODA2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ctrl+Alt+Delete: Why the Nvidia RTX 3050 laptops aren't just for gamers,"Nvidia announced the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPUs this week but while they will no doubt please budget-minded gamers they’ve also got the potential to take on the MacBook Pro for content creation.

Nvidia’s GPUs aren’t just for gaming. That’s thanks to the free-of-charge Nvidia Studio drivers which can optimise the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti GPUs for content creation instead of gaming. In Nvidia’s own words “Nvidia Studio Drivers provide artists creators and 3D developers the best performance and reliability when working with creative applications.”

While these drivers work across many Nvidia GPUs they look particularly well matched with the new RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti mobile GPUs. Various laptops brands clearly agree with me with non-gaming laptops such as the Dell XPS 15 and Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Pro embracing the RTX 3050 mobile GPU.

But how good are the RTX 3050 GPUs compared to existing options such as those found inside the MacBook Pro? It’s too early for me to do my own testing but Nvidia has provided its own benchmarks. Take these results with a pinch of salt for now but it’s still interesting to have a look.

Nvidia claims a laptop with an RTX 3050 Ti will see 3.1x faster speeds than a laptop relying on integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. That apparently translates into significantly shorter export speeds on Adobe Premiere Pro falling from a 60 minutes down to an outstanding 20 minutes. And compared to the MacBook Pro with a Radeon Pro 5600M GPU the RTX 3050 Ti is supposedly quicker by an 8-minute margin.

Nvidia also suggests the RTX 3050 Ti can render a heavy scene on Blender in just 26 minutes which is very quick compared to the MacBook Pro (Radeon Pro 5600M) which takes a whopping 1 hour and 17 minutes.

So if Nvidia’s benchmark results are accurate there’s no doubt that the RTX 3050 GPUs provide superior performance compared to the most powerful 16-inch MacBook Pro and Intel’s Iris Xe graphics. But that’s not very useful without knowing the price points.

Fortunately the most enticing aspect of the RTX 3050 GPUs is that they don’t cost a lot of money for manufacturers to fit inside laptops. The Dell XPS 15 with an RTX 3050 Ti will reportedly cost $1249.99. That’s hardly cheap but consider the cheapest 16-inch MacBook Pro costs a whopping $2399.00 and the Dell suddenly looks an absolute bargain.

Of course the upcoming MacBook Pro 2021 will likely leapfrog the performance provided by the RTX 3050 by a considerable margin but Apple’s laptop is also expected to cost a pretty sum. If you want to keep costs down to a minimum but still want to edit video and animate on the go it’s definitely worth checking out these new RTX 3050 laptops.

Intel seems to be the one that is pushing for the new power-efficient ATX12VO power standard with the launch of its upcoming 12th Gen Core ""Alder Lake-S"" platform. But the thing is: motherboard makers and PSU manufacturers aren't happy with the news.

It would mean a new 10-pin power connector on your motherboard -- so a new motherboard. It would also mean a new 10-pin power connector ready on your new PSU as the power supply can't feature any other power rails other than 12V. If voltage is lower or higher than 12V then it means the motherboard will be converting that power and not the PSU like normal.

Motherboards will be much more complex... costing more money... thus they are not happy about the move just yet.

VideoCardz said that it spoke with its sources at motherboard makers who confirmed that ""Intel is indeed interested in ATX12VO becoming a more popular standard but right now there is strong opposition from motherboard makers as well as power supply manufacturers. Most high-end gaming boards for Alder Lake are unlikely to feature ATX12VO standards. We might however see a lot more entry-level motherboards for system integrators and pre-built system suppliers who are interested in offering the best power efficiency to meet strict government power regulations"".",,,

Daniel Beeker Senior Principal Engineer at NXP Semiconductor shared a field-based perspective on high-speed PCB design. Finishing up the last day was Danny Kim Director of Advisory Services at VSI Labs who delivered an OEM update of trends in the “new” advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) for autonomous vehicles.

You can register for on-demand viewing of all of the sessions here. Now let’s look at what’s been covered in the last few days of this technically rich webinar series.

Field-based High-Speed PCB Design

Beeker began his presentation by noting that good signal integrity and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) start with a solid printed circuit board (PCB) design philosophy which includes a clear understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic (EM) fields. Proper design of the invisible spaces these fields follow through the board is critical. Creating transmission lines that will meet the needs of the power distribution network (PDN) and the fast-switching ICs in today’s high-performance products can be a challenge.

Beeker presented an easy-to-understand science-based approach to PCB design covering the basic behavior of EM fields as they move through the board and ways to control them. Considering the characteristics of the ICs on the design of the PCB layout provides for a more balanced system. Other important topics were the characteristics to define the PDN component selection and placement as well as knowing the interconnects needed to create the transmission lines that support these requirements. These characteristics can then be used to define the transmission lines that carry the high-speed signals.

For example proper power supply design results in depletion/reflection cycles with increasing cycle times and decreasing wavefront slope. Such designs are driven by the distance between field storage devices and their package sizes. Beeker emphasized proper power supply design would result in a virtual steady-state flow of field energy from the input power supply to the devices which then consume the field energy. The design goal was to manage the movement of field energy through the PCB board and component spaces.

OEM Roundup 2021: The New ADAS

In its OEM Roundup VSI Labs reported that automotive OEMs have debuted new and enhanced L2+ ADAS systems based on improved software algorithms additional sensors and more scalable platforms. A few OEMs have been interested in demonstrating L3 reliability in their new systems while most others were busy enhancing features of their L2+ systems. While six levels of driving automation reveal that the biggest gap is between Level 2 and 3 OEMs are pushing to market L2+ and L2++ systems namely “The New ADAS.”

What is L2+? It’s a term introduced by Mobileye at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). When Mobileye promoted the Road Experience Management (REM) solutions along with L2+ they highlighted the high-definition (HD) map as being the single most contributing component to improve L2 systems. Then At CES 2019 Nvidia joined in discussion with other key contributing enablers of enhanced ADAS: surround perception and AI DMS and AI cockpit technologies.

In his webinar Kim investigated the latest trends and systems in OEMs’ consumer ADAS in 2021. One trend was that the industry had extended the definition of L2+ to embrace a certain configuration of ADAS systems that contained additional components. He shared what OEMs saw as the biggest gap of driving automation and how ADAS would fill it while covering the timeline expectations for L2+/L2++ in the ADAS technology rollout.

In addition to these free webinar sessions registered attendees had the opportunity to enjoy a networking session at the close of the week where they met with fellow attendees set up one-on-one meetings and got to know industry peers.

Further registered attendees of the Spring Break Webinar can also look forward to receiving a discount code to attend DesignCon’s annual in-person conference set to take place between August 16-18 2021 at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center CA.

It was the last RIIL baseball we’d see for almost two full years.

After last season was wiped out due to COVID-19 baseball is back this spring with an abbreviated season and yes we should be crowning a champ toward the end of June.

The season’s been going on for a little over a week and will be over before we know it. Here are some storylines to pay attention to this season:

RIC won't replace McCoy

Seeing high school’s best teams play for championships at McCoy Stadium makes more unforgettable memories. Will all due respect toward the other venues that host championships in the state there’s nothing in Rhode Island high school sports that compared to playing on the same field as future MLB stars.

Those days are over. With the PawSox having left Rhode Island high schoolers are now robbed of the opportunity to step on the field.

The league has listed Rhode Island College as the new home of the baseball finals. While the venue has been terrific to the RIIL and all teams who’ve played there it just doesn’t have the allure that McCoy did.

Hendricken’s big three

Missing last season meant not being able to see the state’s fine seniors grace the field one more time. It also meant we didn’t get to see the development of Rhode Island’s next stars.

Hendricken has three of the biggest names in high school baseball with Alex Clemmey Brandyn Durand and Andrew Noland. All three have verbally committed to SEC schools — Clemmey to Vanderbilt. Durand to Kentucky Noland to Wake Forest — before they’ve really had a chance to play varsity baseball.

We may have missed the opportunity to see them come into their own as sophomores but it will be fun to see players of that caliber take the field this spring.

Can Coventry’s aces beat the kings?

There might not be a team with a better 1-2 pitching punch than the Oakers this spring.

Jayden Voelker has been a star since his freshman season when he helped Coventry reach the state final and now — after two All-State appearances in two years — remains one of the top pitchers in Rhode Island as a senior. Voelker is headed to Old Dominion in the fall but not before he tries to get the Oakers a state title.

Right behind him in the rotation is sophomore Tom Turner one of the star pitchers for the Coventry team that made it to the Little League World Series in 2018. Turner verbally committed to the University of Houston before he had a chance to suit up for the Oakers so expectations are high for the sophomore.

Grown-up Little League stars

Warwick North's players were stars in the summer of 2016 advancing to the Little League World Series and winning a game before being ousted from the tourney in a walk-off loss.

Those boys will have a chance to be stars again this spring as most of the team are now members of the Pilgrim varsity team.

Of the 13 Warwick North players seven are currently on the Patriots roster. Chase Pariseau and Kenny Rix are seniors this season while Dylan Bourette Sean Gallagher Cam Nadeau Aaron Narcavage and D.J. Sollitto are all juniors.

They’re not the only members of the team still playing. Lemieux the MVP of the 2019 RIIL Championship Series was also a member of that Warwick North team as are his Hendricken teammates Brendan McCaffrey and Max Turner. Another Warwick North alum Domenic Brazeau is playing for La Salle this spring.

New face same Prout?

The Crusaders had a steady presence in Mike LaBarbera but after he stepped down as the only head coach the team has had since joining the RIIL will the team’s fortunes change?

Don’t bet on it. Ty Cosgrove certainly has big shoes to fill but the foundation at Prout is solid. The Crusaders are more than a team; they’re a program. LaBarbera will still be around as an assistant and expect Prout to make some noise in D-II this spring.

Welcome to the show

The Rhode Island Interscholastic League welcomed two new programs to the mix this spring as Blackstone Valley Prep and Block Island will both field teams for the first time.

Both teams will be in Division III with the Pride playing in the III-A subdivision and the Hurricanes playing in III-B. The two teams are scheduled to play each other in the final game of the regular season on June 11 on the island.

Old rivals in the race

South Kingstown and North Kingstown should both contend for a state title this season.

South boasts Seton Hall-bound Jack Wentworth and future Bryant Bulldog Zac Zyons both of whom started as freshmen for SK when it won it all in 2018. Ben Brutti will be the ace of the staff a big (6-foot-3 200-pounds) hard-throwing right-hander who’s headed to URI next year.

North will be led on the mound this year by Evan Maloney a 6-4 right-handed junior who’s verbally committed to Wake Forest. He’ll be backed up by T.J. Gormley a junior shortstop who’s committed to Maine.

If the last names sound familiar they should. Gormley’s father is Kevin the Skippers’ head coach. Maloney’s father Sean was a former NK star in the late 1980s who went on to pitch in the major leagues.

How will COVID affect the season?

At some point we’re bound to have teams go into quarantine. Throughout the school year teams have done their best to avoid any situation like that but sometimes being careful just isn’t enough. COVID is just a part of life and you adjust to it.

For now players will be required to wear masks. However there is hope that with the state’s new guidelines those rules will be adjusted so only players with consistent contact with others — i.e. the catcher — will have to wear them.

Restrictions on spectators at outdoor events have been changed so there should be plenty of opportunities for family to watch.

Some predictions

Based on basketball and football there are fewer things people love more than my predictions so here goes.

It feels like Hendricken is the heavy favorite to win Division I and while there’s plenty of quality teams out there — I didn’t even mention squads like Cranston West East Providence or La Salle in this — give me the Oakers and their arms to get to the final with the Hawks winning a thrilling series.

East Greenwich is now in Division II and when the Avengers are down a division they automatically become my favorite to win. So I’ll say it’s EG in the final against Barrington before both teams move up to Division I where they belong.

D-III is always tough to predict but Dino Campopiano does a terrific job at Shea so give me the Raiders to win the title over Central Falls. Why the Warriors? They’ve got a new field and I’m pretty sure baseball rules dictate ""‘look good play good.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kb21pbmlvbnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTUvcG9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC1uY2FhLXRyYW5zZmVyLXBvcnRhbC1naXZlcy1jb2xsZWdlLWF0aGxldGVzLWEtbmV3LWF2ZW51ZS10by1jaGFuZ2Utc2Nob29scy1idXQtaXRzLWFsc28tbW9yZS10aGFuLWp1c3QtYS1yZWNydWl0aW5nLXRvb2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PORTAL KOMBAT: NCAA Transfer Portal gives college athletes a new avenue to change schools but it's also more ...,"MORGANTOWN W. Va. — There may be no better way to introduce the impact the NCAA Transfer Portal has had on college athletics than with the Syracuse women’s basketball team.

In 2016 the Orange lost to Connecticut in the national championship game and Syracuse has been in the NCAA tournament in four of the five seasons that followed including a second-round loss to Connecticut this season.

In the midst of one of the strongest runs in school history 12 players have since entered the portal and are looking to continue their college careers elsewhere.

That’s 12 players — NCAA women’s hoops teams allow 15 scholarship players per season — from one team in the span of two months.

“I saw that” WVU women’s basketball coach Mike Carey said. “That kind of shows you just how much the portal has changed everything. It shows you just how much the power is in the athletes’ hands right now. It’s not the coaches and the schools with the power the athletes have the power.”

The situation at Syracuse may be an extreme but transfer numbers across NCAA athletics are on the rise.

According to an NCAA study released in 2020 15.3% — roughly 700 athletes — of men’s basketball players at Division I schools transferred to another Division I school in the 2018-19 school year. The figure did not include the number of players who transferred to a school at a lower NCAA division. That number was 9.5% in 2004 the study said.

In women’s basketball the number of transfers from one Division I school to another was 11.9% (roughly 627) which was up from 7.8% in 2004.

Those percentages were not the highest. That honor belonged to men’s soccer where 18.6% of its athletes transferred from one Division I school to another up from 11.8% in 2004.

In football the numbers were mostly consistent from 3.9% transferring in 2004 to 4.6% (roughly 509) in 2019 from one FBS school to another.

Handling the rise of transfer numbers across all the sports had begun to become a paperwork nightmare for university compliance offices which is where we begin the story of how the portal came to be what it exactly is and the impact it will have on the future of college athletics.

What is the transfer portal?

The portal officially opened for all NCAA Division I and II schools in the fall of 2018.

In its purest sense the portal itself is nothing more than a database on the internet.

It is password-protected and the compliance office at each school gives head coaches and assistant coaches an individual password.

While compliance officials can browse through the thousands of names from each sport the coaches’ passwords allow them to only see the athletes in the sports they coach.

WVU men’s basketball head coach Bob Huggins can not browse through football transfers not that he’s much of a browser of the portal to begin with.

“I hardly look at it” Huggins said. “I’m not on it very much at all.”

The portal is not a dating site either. The athletes who enter it have no access to their profiles.

Where it gets interesting is the portal is not technically a recruiting website much like Rivals.com where you can see lists of the top high school recruits from around the country in different sports and what schools they are being recruited by.

There are no five and four-star ratings next to an athlete’s name in the portal. There are no headshots no stats no 40-yard dash times no positions played not even their heights or weights are listed.

What you will find accompanied with each athlete’s profile are answered questions such as their academic standing how much eligibility they have remaining and whether or not the athlete has been redshirted.

If the athlete competes in a conference that prohibits intra-conference transferring that is also listed.

Contact info is also listed. Athletes have the option of releasing their cell phone numbers or just an email address.

“Yeah it’s really not as exciting as most people probably think it is” Carey said. “You see the names but not much else that would let you know if that player can help you or not. The coaches have to do the research.

“The good thing is you’re already familiar with most of the names from scouting them or seeing them play in high school.”

While the database is used by hundreds of college coaches for recruiting purposes the portal’s truest purpose is to cut down on much of the leg work compliance officials have to do in order to complete an athlete’s transfer by NCAA standards.

In pre-portal days an athlete wishing to transfer would have to keep what was called a transfer tracer handy.

The tracer was paperwork that contained the basic information now found in the portal that had to be signed by the school to officially release the athlete as well as the school which took the athlete in.

Once complete the tracer had to be either mailed or faxed back to the original school in order for the transfer to be compliant with NCAA regulations.

Now all of that is done with a couple clicks of a mouse.

It’s also easy for an athlete to enter the portal.

According to NCAA rules athletes do not even have to notify their coaches they are transferring although most do.

They only need to visit their school’s compliance office and fill out a form that asks general questions about eligibility and academic standing.

WVU also asks athletes their reasons for transferring on the form but it is optional whether they give a reason or not.

Once the form is filled out a school has two business days to enter the athlete’s name in the portal.

Once in the portal an athlete’s life can become hectic quickly.

“It starts with text messages” said former WVU men’s basketball guard Jordan McCabe who transferred to UNLV in April. “Once your name goes into the portal the messages begin almost immediately.

“It’s usually stuff like “What are you looking for?’ or “Here’s what we have to offer’ stuff like that.”

The text messages then turn into phone calls about 10 hours worth on a daily basis according to McCabe.

“My girlfriend wants to throw my cell phone into the Mon River” he joked. “That’s kind of how hectic it gets.”

The portal’s impact

The NCAA granted a blanket waiver in 2020 for athletes in all sports to transfer without having to sit out a season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In April the NCAA passed a rule granting athletes in all sports to transfer once and gain immediate eligibility.

Technically the ruling is not because of the availability of the transfer portal but the portal is now taking the brunt of frustration from coaches who oppose the rule.

“If they pass immediate eligibility you’ll see teams recruiting in the handshake line after games” Huggins once said before the rule was passed. “I think passing the rule is one of the worst things they could do.”

As of May 7 there were nearly 1300 names in the men’s basketball portal. There were more than 1000 in 2020.

In 2020 964 scholarship FBS football players entered the portal according to an article published by Sports Illustrated with nearly a third of them not finding another home at a Division I school.

Some men’s and women’s basketball players also do not find new schools at the Division I level due to the number of incoming high school and junior-college recruits that are signed.

“Right now there are a lot of kids in the portal that are not going to find scholarships” Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said in the Sports Illustrated article. “There may be twice as many people in the portal as there are places to transfer. There will be some who won’t be able to go to college if they don’t get a scholarship.”

With the influx of new names available though the portal has become a viable option in recruiting.

“It gives you a chance for a quick fix” said Carey who lost three players to the portal in 2021 but also signed three players from the portal who will play next season. “It’s become another option. If you don’t maybe get the high school player you want you used to go the junior-college route but now you can go right into the portal.”

As far as monitoring the portal Huggins and Carey said they have assigned assistant coaches who check daily for new names that may have entered it.

The WVU men’s hoops team also lost forwards Emmitt Matthews Jr. and Oscar Tshiebwe to the portal along with McCabe but the Mountaineers signed forwards Pauly Paulicap from DePaul and Dimon Carrigan (FIU) as well as guard Malik Curry (Old Dominion).

“We went for needs” Huggins said. “We had a need for a shot blocker which was something we didn’t have last season. I think we got two of the best ones in the country (in Paulicap and Carrigan). We have Deuce (McBride) looking at the (NBA) draft so we had a need to go out and get some help there.”

The portal’s future

The one lingering question or theory about the future of the portal is whether it changes how coaches feel about recruiting high school athletes?

The questions coaches may be asking themselves: Why bother signing a high school prospect if the math says they are likely to transfer to another school?

“You hear coaches talk that way” Huggins said. “It’s a risk recruiting a high school player now especially if you don’t think they can come in and play right away. If they don’t play they’re probably going to go somewhere else where they can play.”

Is Huggins among the coaches considering no longer signing high school prospects?

“No the portal hasn’t really changed our approach to recruiting” he said. “We’ll try to go after the best player we can find and that includes high school guys.

“I do want to see how this whole thing plays out with the portal. You certainly have to pay attention to it.”

The portal takes and it gives WVU by the numbers in football men’s basketball and women’s basketball since the NCAA Transfer Portal opened in 2018: FOOTBALL: The Mountaineers have lost 36 scholarship players to the portal and have signed 12 transfers. WVU has signed three so far who will be eligible for next season. MEN’S BASKETBALL: WVU has had eight scholarship players transfer out and have signed four. Three players have been signed from the portal for next season including Malik Curry (right) who played at Old Dominion last season. WOMEN’S BASKETBALL: WVU has had nine scholarship players enter the portal while signing seven. The Mountaineers have signed three who will play next season.

Benkert broke the news himself tweeting a picture of him signing with Green Bay. Adam Schefter quote tweeted Benkert’s tweet confirming the signing.

“The best advice I can give anyone is to believe in yourself. Packers (writing emoji) … I’m so thankful” Benkert tweeted with a photo of him signing his contract while wearing a Packers shirt.

The Packers have Aaron Rodgers and Jordan Love under contract. However Rodgers is embroiled in a rift with the Packers front office.

If Rodgers does not show up for voluntary offseason training camp (OTAs) the Packers will need additional quarterbacks in camp. And that is where Benkert and Bortles will truly have an opportunity to shine.

A three-star recruit according to the 247Sports Composite out of Cape Coral Fla. Kurt Benkert took a winding road to appear on the NFL radar. After signing with East Carolina and then-head coach Ruffin McNeil Benkert redshirted in 2013 before seeing action in three games in 2014. Tabbed as the starting quarterback heading into the 2015 season a knee injury forced Benkert to miss the campaign. Meanwhile McNeil resigned his position and became the defensive coordinator at Virginia following the 2015 season.

Benkert a graduate transfer picked UVA and was immediately the favorite to start under center for new head coach Bronco Mendenhall. In Benkert’s first year in Charlottesville despite injuring his shoulder in the third game of the season he passed for 2552 yards 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 12 games. As a senior Benkert looked like a different player. Confident and finally healthy Benkert passed for a UVA record 3207 yards along with 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions and helped lead the Cavaliers to a bowl game for the first time since 2011."

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1500-2000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals BoA reported.

The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus the impact of the ongoing chip shortage is not limited to semiconductor stocks since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle BoA noted.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Aided by 5G Broadband and U.S. Chip Making

Similar to industrial stocks semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus in 5G broadband and domestic chip manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist in semiconductor stocks they are offset by “solid visibility” that is driven by non-cancellable orders product customization and broad-based demand BoA concluded.

Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in gross margins signaling that semiconductor companies are “very effective” in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a positive driver for the sector BoA noted. As a result the SOX index has benefitted from rising rates historically.

“Over the past five years chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X” said Hilary Kramer who hosts the nationally aired “Millionaire Maker” radio program and heads the GameChangers and Value Authority advisory services.

Value investments had been trouncing growth stocks heading into trading on May 11 with the Russell 3000 Value Index up 19.1% in 2021 compared to a gain of 4.3% for the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested “a rest” would be overdue and healthy for the market.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates suggesting the market growth will last beyond 2022 Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage semiconductor stocks have not performed well since early April.

Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is “not great” but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

The top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) a Santa Clara California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA’s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS) above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers.

Potential catalysts for AMAT’s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity upgrades market share loss in key segments merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds BoA noted.

AMAT and two other large U.S.-based semiconductor vendors — Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) a Fremont California-based provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to help chipmakers build smaller and faster electronic devices and KLA Corp. (NASDAQ:KLAC) a semiconductor capital equipment company in Milpitas California trade at 20x average forward P/E. That P/E is two turns below the broad market despite solid multi-year visibility strong balance sheets and potential double-digit-percentage sales and EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next 3-5 years BoA noted.

Lam Research Ranks Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

BoA gave Lam Research a $725 price target based on 20x cash adjusted 2022E P/E within the stock’s historical range of 8x-24x and based on LRCX’s 20%-plus EPS growth rate. Amid a multi-year wafer fabrication equipment growth cycle LRCX is well positioned to benefit the investment firm wrote.

Potential upside catalysts to LRCX’s price objective are stronger-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity increased semiconductor equipment sales and improved market share. Downside risks are a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity additions and a market share loss.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Include U.S.-based KLA Corp.

KLA Corp. gained a $400 price objective from BoA based on 22x 2022E P/E within KLAC’s historical range of 10x-26x. The investment firm envisions KLAC as a key enabler of semiconductor manufacturing technology offering a less cyclical topline industry leading profit margins and best-in-class shareholder returns.

Risks to BoA’s price objective for KLAC are the cyclical nature of semiconductor capital spending and its impact on earnings as well as competitive price and market share issues particularly against Applied Materials. Another vulnerability would occur if trouble arose in bringing new products and technologies to market BoA cautioned.

Nova Measuring Instruments Gets Berth as One of Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI) a Rehovot Israel-based provider of metrology devices for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing received a $108 price objective from BoA based on 34x a 2022 estimated non-GAAP EPS that includes stock compensation and adjustments for net cash. The valuation is within its peer range of 20x-40x and is justified BoA noted due to Nova’s superior gross margin profile and its potential to outgrow the market in the next three years.

Downside risks for the stock could include an inability to earn share in new X-Ray metrology market stiff competition from large rivals such as KLA Corp. and historically cyclical semiconductor capital spending. Nonetheless BoA lists NVMI among the six best semiconductor stocks.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Feature Teradyne

Another of the six best semiconductor stocks to buy now is Teradyne Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) a North Reading Massachusetts-based maker of automatic test equipment. BoA’s $155 price objective on TER is based on 25x P/E applied to a fiscal year 2022 estimated Non-GAAP EPS.

The expected P/E is at the high end of Teradyne’s long-term trading range of 12x-26x given TER’s recent and unique exposure to 5G/automation cyclical recovery in auto and industrial markets and market share gains in core semiconductor testing. Downside risks to the investment firm’s price objective are cyclicality and potential loss of market share in the core semiconductor test market along with increasing competition in the robotics segment BoA cautioned.

NVDA Gains Place Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

A BoA buy recommendation NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%.

In addition BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU) as well as its software and development ecosystem BoA added.

Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E excluding cash at the higher-end of NVDA’s historical 20x-54x P/E range showing NVIDIA’s superior long-term growth profile in large underpenetrated markets according to BoA.

Risks to achieving BoA’s price objective include NVDA’s exposure to the personal computer market competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors “lumpy and unpredictable sales” in new enterprise data center and auto markets potential reduced capital returns possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.

Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman

“The semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology” said Bob Carlson chairman of the Board of Trustees of Virginia’s Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. “Asian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.”

The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage said Carlson who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).

The top holdings in PSI recently were Applied Materials (AMAT) Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) Texas Instruments (TXN) Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) Carlson said.

Bipartisan concern about China’s rising influence is driving the Senate toward passage of legislation aimed at bolstering U.S. competitiveness in technology and manufacturing and delivering money to spur the domestic semiconductor industry.The Senate is poised to begin action this week on the package of bills based on a proposal from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young with the goal of finishing by the end of the month.

The main part of the bill would authorize more than $100 billion over five years to boost research and development of innovative technology and manufacturing at colleges universities and other institutions and create a new entity within the National Science Foundation to focus on technology.

It’s also expected to include a $50 billion emergency appropriation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing as well as funding for a communications security initiative designed to counter China’s dominance of 5G networks according to a person familiar with the matter.

The package is being pushed toward passage on an aggressive timetable by Schumer. The fervor among Democrats and Republicans to counter about China’s challenge to U.S. economic primacy has made the legislation known as the Endless Frontiers Act one of the few bills to draw broad support at time when partisan divisions are running deep. Its fate also may serve as an indicator for other proposals such as infrastructure that have nominal bipartisan support.

“Federal underinvestment in sciences has seen our country slip exposing critical weak spots in our economy” Schumer last week setting up the first vote on the legislation. “If we don’t fix them we will no longer be the number one economic leader in the world.”

Related to that goal is a separate proposal expected to be included that would provide $50 billion for a program aimed at increasing semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. that was passed as part of the 2021 defense bill but never funded. The proposal has gained urgency as a global shortage of semiconductors causes economic pain in the U.S. shutting down auto plants because of a lack of chips for cars and trucks.

Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas has been working on the proposal with Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona along with others and said he expects it will supported by the White House as well as Senate Republicans. President Joe Biden in his broader infrastructure proposal has called for as much as $50 billion to expand U.S. chipmaking.

“If China decided to cut off our supply of semiconductors it would be like the Strait of Hormuz is to oil” Cornyn said. “It would be a disaster economically.”

Despite generally broad support the Endless Frontier Act was the subject of a sometimes contentious markup session in the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday.

Scores of amendments were proposed and some were adopted sometimes over the protest of co-sponsor Young. In particular he called an amendment proposed by Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico a “poison pill” because it would divert some of the funding to the Department of Energy for its network of national laboratories. Among those is the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.

Funding Shift

“I am disappointed that an amendment was adopted to divert significant funding away from the NSF Tech Directorate in favor of a program outside of the Committee’s jurisdiction” Young said in a statement after the bill was approved by the committee.

“I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure the final product lives up to its billing – a bold investment in research education technology transfer and the core strengths of the U.S. innovation ecosystem” he said.

The legislation has been carved up into separate tranches with about half of the money going to the core functions of the National Science Foundation and another almost $30 billion going to help stand up a new tech directorate within the agency.

Lujan’s amendment sends about $17 billion to the national labs. His co-sponsors included GOP Senators Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota all of whom represent states where the national labs have a presence. Lujan’s amendment passed 23 to 5 and the overall bill passed the Commerce Committee by 24-4.

Such political horse-trading—along with a bipartisan desire to confront China—may be key to passage in the Senate.

The Endless Frontier Act which is supported by numerous industry and trade groups will be combined with a bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year and with proposals from other Senate committees including Banking and the HELP committee. Senators will also be able to offer amendments on the floor. The process for passing the overall package is estimated to take two weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzL2dlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLzIwMjEvMDUvMTUvZ20tcGFya3MtdGhvdXNhbmRzLWNhcnMtYXdhaXRpbmctY2hpcHMtYXQtbXN1LWxvdC81MDgwMjgwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSU gets a cash windfall from GM as the automaker parks unfinished cars,"Your subscription supports:

But a deal appears to be coming both faster than expected and not in the form that many anticipated.

It appears that AT&T is about to do a deal with Discovery that top sources believe will mean the ascent of Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav 60 and a likely changing of the guard at WarnerMedia. Caveat: The words you are about to read involve speculation but not uninformed speculation. With that a few takeaways:

Deal or no deal this gets the ground in Hollywood shaking. Before it emerged that Discovery was in the game the betting had been that NBCUniversal would make off with the WarnerMedia assets including premium cabler HBO Warner Bros. Studios and Turner networks like TNT and TBS. A decision to make an offer would have been up to NBCU owner Comcast which may have hesitated and lost out on the chance. Now sources believe NBCU will turn its sights on ViacomCBS.

Whether or not that happens says one knowledgeable source depends on if ViacomCBS chairman Shari Redstone is a seller (she’d have to consider it given the state of the media world) and if the deal — which would potentially bring assets including CBS and NBC with their various news operations under one roof not to mention Paramount and Universal — can pass federal antitrust scrutiny. It would be sure to face a much harder look from regulators than a Discovery combination with WarnerMedia and there is no doubt assets would have to be shed if such a marriage were attempted. Viacom declined to comment and Discovery and NBCU did not respond to a query.

On to the deal: Top media insiders say one of Discovery’s largest shareholders Liberty Media chairman John Malone 80 will have crafted a structure with what one calls “a brilliant tax dimensionality to it.” (Malone who has been making deals in the telecom and media industries for decades is known to seek out esoteric and occasionally underutilized pieces of tax law to minimize his and his company’s tax exposure. For example Malone gushed in a CNBC interview about the “brilliant” tax structure for Liberty’s acquisition of Formula 1 a deal that included a tracking stock and shell companies spread across multiple continents.) These top insiders cannot see a world where the deal doesn’t put Malone in control meaning Zaslav runs the combined entity. They do not see this as a promising development for 50-year-old WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar.

Malone has not hidden his questions about the AT&T/WarnerMedia streaming adventure. In 2018 he said this to CNBC’s David Faber: “I don’t know if AT&T is willing to write those massive checks to play against the incumbents Amazon Netflix and to compete with Disney on the margin for that third seat. If I was [then AT&T chairman Randall Stephenson] I would be scratching my head and saying ‘When I bought HBO it was the crown jewel it was what I wanted; now it is subscale. The question now is how much do I have to spend and how much income do I have to forgo for the next couple of years to build up?’” It appears that current AT&T boss John Stankey came to scratch his head about that too.

Malone is known to be a media-world genius but was it really that hard to anticipate that AT&T might have difficulty figuring out how to run a legacy media operation especially when it is fighting battles on other fronts? AT&T is a telecommunications company and now appears to be one in the long list of outsiders to find that entertainment is hard especially in pandemic-accelerated transformational times.

Saddled with debt the company was warned by more than one of its own in-house entertainment-industry veterans (who found themselves kicked to the curb) that the spend required to launch a streaming service would be massive — far more than the parent would be willing or able to spend. (Asked about the possible spending crunch in a May 14 interview in The Wall Street Journal Kilar responded: “Sounds juicy.”)

This appears to be the second big bobble for AT&T which acquired DirecTV for $67 billion inclusive of debt in 2015 and this year agreed to spin it off (alongside AT&T’s own UVerse business) in a deal valued at only $16.25 billion. That’s a $50 billion haircut. It isn’t yet clear how the former Time Warner assets will be valued in a new deal with Discovery.

A source with knowledge says that two years ago Zaslav proposed combining Discovery and HBO Max in a joint venture but that Stankey nixed the proposal. Times have changed. Discovery’s streaming rollout for Discovery+ has been somewhat slow going with the company disclosing in April that all of its streaming services combined have 15 million subscribers. Nonetheless Zaslav told investors the rollout was “exceeding our expectations and demonstrating sustained momentum into the second quarter.”

Should all go forward it is far from clear how the new company will be configured. One person rumored to be hungering for a bigger job at WarnerMedia is CNN president Jeff Zucker 56 who is known to have locked horns with Kilar and who said in February that he will leave at the end of the year. Now the question is will he?

It may be petty gossip to note that Zaslav is very good friends golf buddies and Hamptons neighbors with Zucker. But industry insiders have noted this gossip. They also believe Zucker may have let Stankey know he was leaving if Kilar was staying. The CNN chief remains on very friendly terms with Stankey and was invited on the AT&T chief’s Augusta golf outing over the holidays even after announcing his plan to leave.

One associate thinks this deal may mean Zucker will stick around. “My intuition is he doesn’t want Jason Kilar’s job believe it or not” this person says. With oversight of CNN and Turner Sports which just closed deals with the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball Zucker may see running those businesses as “fun” this person says while “the HBO Max thing is really complicated really messy.”

If a major changing of the guard is indeed coming at WarnerMedia there will be schadenfreude. In the aftermath of AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner new management has purged the old guard including veterans with a sense of how to run legacy media businesses. Some of those people as well as others in Hollywood have bristled at the certitude of Stankey’s chosen WarnerMedia boss Kilar. Whatever big checks WarnerMedia has written to smooth over its decision to blindside Hollywood with its day-and-date streaming strategy in December for example the sting of it lingers. So does the purge of those who had spent careers building WarnerMedia assets.

“It wasn’t perfect but it really was a cool place” recalls one former insider who says AT&T management “did not have to destroy the DNA” that made these places special before adding “The shame of it. The arrogance.”

DD had a question and answer video session with her fans on Twitter in which her frank statements regarding all aspects of her life have taken the internet by storm.

Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and cohost of the ""Pitchfork Economics"" podcast with Nick Hanauer and David Goldstein.

In the latest episode they spoke with economist Mariana Mazzucato on government's role in the economy.

Mazzucato says collaboration between government and corporations can boost economic ""outcomes as opposed to just output.""

See more stories on Insider's business page.

When you trim away all the complications and high-minded theories the single mission statement of an economy under capitalism is to grow. We say an economy is healthy when it's adding jobs productivity and profits and we say an economy is sick when it's contracting losing jobs and failing to hit profitability markers.

But shouldn't we expect more than aimless growth from an economy? Shouldn't our economy reward growth in sectors that would benefit everyone – environmental science say – and discourage growth in sectors that harm the public good such as the privatization of our water supply?

How government influences the economy

Government is supposed to be a counterweight on the economy's untapped growth. Regulations tax credits and other incentives are supposed to encourage beneficial growth and discourage the harm produced by unfettered capitalism. But over the last four decades the government has largely abdicated itself from the regulatory role giving companies free license to blindly pursue growth for growth's sake.

In this week's episode of ""Pitchfork Economics"" economics professor Mariana Mazzucato discusses her new book ""Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism."" Her goal with the book is in the words of co-host David Goldstein to encourage a new kind of economics that values ""outcomes as opposed to just output.""

""For some years now I've been working with policymakers globally trying to convince them that we need to redesign policy away from fixing markets and towards creating and shaping markets"" Mazzucato said.

That would take the form she explained of governments creating ""a list of big problems that we have"" as a society from ""the future of mobility"" to ""solving key issues around the digital divide"" to ""getting the plastic out of the ocean."" Lawmakers would then design a strategy to involve ""as many different sectors as possible to collaborate and to innovate together to solve that problem.""

Government's role in this case would be as a purchaser as a backer of ""grants and loans to galvanize as much bottom-up innovation and investment as possible to actually solve problems"" and as a director of ""what I've been calling mission-oriented policy.""

It would direct and incentivize the best of corporate America to solve some of humanity's biggest problems putting the profit motive to work for the greater good.

The DARPA example

Mazzucato says in the United States we already have one perfect example of a government entity that encourages innovation in pursuit of a single goal: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA. Founded in the 1950s alongside NASA as during America's race to the moon she says the government established in DARPA ""a new design of public-private partnership.""

""There was lots of investment by companies like Honeywell Motorola and General Electric"" Mazzucato said and in the quest to build spacefaring technologies American companies built inventions that would eventually create the touchscreens voice-activated artificial intelligence camera phones GPS and driverless car tech. Basically without the moonshot we might still not have the necessary technologies to build smartphones today.

But those technologies were not the end goal for the ""purpose-focused"" organization. ""For example DARPA basically invented and funded what we today call the internet"" Mazzucato explained. ""But no one in DARPA said 'Oh we need the internet.' They had a problem to solve which was getting the satellites to communicate and the internet was the solution to that.""

DARPA is singularly focused on defense issues so Mazzucato is calling for an array of new ARPAs to address societal problems which ""are much harder than purely technological ones. They often require regulatory change behavioral change and political change"" she said.







Unleashing innovation

When governments set these huge seemingly impossible goals for industry they empower our sharpest minds to broaden their thinking and elevate their game to work in concert with others. Part of the reason this framework has been far more successful than traditional corporate structures in terms of unleashing innovation Mazzucato explains is that the thinkers are ""explicitly told to be risk-taking to welcome the uncertainty.""

The path to the Moon was littered with waste dead ends and spectacular failures. That was all part of the plan. Putting government in charge of the direction establishes ""the idea of having real impact so that your successes matter"" Mazzucato said but it's also clear about ""the admission that along the way you're allowed to fail"" in a ""process of trial and error and error and error.""

Economic growth for growth's sake is simply not enough of a mission statement for a society to thrive. Mazzucato believes that government has a necessary goal to direct that growth toward a common good so that we all – corporations humans and the planet as a whole – can benefit from the journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A promising start has fizzled after a 2-0 defeat to the Portland Timbers that came on the heels of a 1-0 loss to the Seattle Sounders on Wednesday.

Perhaps nothing better encapsulated the Quakes’ woes than Chris Wondolowski’s failed penalty kick in the 62nd minute that could have tied the score. Instead it was turned away by rookie Logan Ketterer an emergency loan goalkeeper from the USL’s El Paso Locomotive making his Major League Soccer debut.

Ketterer also stopped Wondolowski’s header near the goal line after a corner kick in the 80th minute.

“It’s not easy to come in for a match like this and have to deliver” Portland coach Giovanni Savarese. “He not only delivered but he was also able to be very influential in so many ways — the way he saved the PK first of all.

“It was his belief that today was going to be our day and in the way we play and him having confidence with the ball and making sure he did the things we asked him to do in playing from the back.”

San Jose coach Matias Almeyda said Wondolowski the MLS’ all-time goal-scoring leader made a good effort on his low penalty shot.

“The goalkeeper stretched his arm and got to the post” he said in Spanish. “I won’t just take away this penalty I will take away the chances we created. Apart from the penalty we were missing the finishing touches.”

Wondolowski was not made available in the post-game video news conference.

The Earthquakes (3-3-0 9 points) had 20 shots and 12 corner kicks against a team that has nine injured players.

Eryk Williamson had two assists to lead the Timbers (2-3-0 6 points). Yimmi Chará took Williamson’s feed in the penalty area and scored over Quakes keeper JT Marchinowski in the fifth minute.

In the 74th minute Williamson served a ball to the far post that Marvin Loría headed into the back of the net.

The Earthquakes just could not capitalize on their chances.

“We need to be more attentive in the final stretch where we really need to make a difference” Quakes winger Cristian Espinoza said in Spanish. “The goals result from our ability to finish them. We have been great in that sense but in our last two matches we were unlucky in our finishing.”

Espinoza said Portland made it tough with most players in a defensive stance.

“We have to find a way to generate attacking plays” he said. “In this match the opponent stayed in their area and waited for our mistakes to launch a counter.”

San Jose which fell to fourth place in the Western Conference finishes a three-game homestand Saturday against Sporting Kansas City (2-1-2 7 points).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNi9jcnlwdG8tYW5kLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tbXVzdC1hY2NlcHQtdGhleS1oYXZlLWEtcHJvYmxlbS10aGVuLWxlYWQtaW4tc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crypto and blockchain must accept they have a problem then lead in sustainability,"Monica Long Contributor

Monica Long is the GM of RippleX

As the price of bitcoin hits record highs and cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream the industry’s expanding carbon footprint becomes harder to ignore.

Just last week Elon Musk announced that Tesla is suspending vehicle purchases using bitcoin due to the environmental impact of fossil fuels used in bitcoin mining. We applaud this decision and it brings to light the severity of the situation — the industry needs to address crypto sustainability now or risk hindering crypto innovation and progress.

The market cap of bitcoin today is a whopping $1 trillion. As companies like PayPal Visa and Square collectively invest billions in crypto market participants need to lead in dramatically reducing the industry’s collective environmental impact.

The increasing demand for crypto means intensifying competition and higher energy use among mining operators. For example during the second half of February we saw the electricity consumption of BTC increase by more than 163% — from 265 TWh to 433 TWh — as the price skyrocketed.

Sustainability has become a topic of concern on the agendas of global and local leaders. The Biden administration rejoining the Paris climate accord was the first indication of this and recently we’ve seen several federal and state agencies make statements that show how much of a priority it will be to address the global climate crisis.

A proposed New York bill aims to prohibit crypto mining centers from operating until the state can assess their full environmental impact. Earlier this year the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission put out a call for public comment on climate disclosures as shareholders increasingly want information on what companies are doing in this regard while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the amount of energy consumed in processing bitcoin is “staggering.” The United Kingdom announced plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% by 2030 and the prime minister launched an ambitious plan last year for a green industrial revolution.

Crypto is here to stay — this point is no longer up for debate. It is creating real-world benefits for businesses and consumers alike — benefits like faster more reliable and cheaper transactions with greater transparency than ever before. But as the industry matures sustainability must be at the center. It’s easier to build a more sustainable ecosystem now than to “reverse engineer” it at a later growth stage. Those in the cryptocurrency markets should consider the auto industry a canary: Carmakers are now retrofitting lower-carbon and carbon-neutral solutions at great cost and inconvenience.

Market participants need to actively work together to realize a low-emissions future powered by clean renewable energy. Last month the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) launched with over 40 supporters — including Ripple World Economic Forum Energy Web Foundation Rocky Mountain Institute and ConsenSys — and the goal to enable all of the world’s blockchains to be powered by 100% renewables by 2025.

Some industry participants are exploring renewable energy solutions but the larger industry still has a long way to go. While 76% of hashers claim they are using renewable energy to power their activities only 39% of hashing’s total energy consumption comes from renewables.

To make a meaningful impact the industry needs to come up with a standard that’s open and transparent to measure the use of renewables and make renewable energy accessible and cheap for miners. The CCA is already working on such a standard. In addition companies can pay for high-quality carbon offsets for remaining emissions — and perhaps even historical ones.

While the industry works to become more sustainable long term there are green choices that can be made now and some industry players are jumping on board. Fintechs like Stripe have created carbon renewal programs to encourage its customers and partners to be more sustainable.

Companies can partner with organizations like Energy Web Foundation and the Renewable Energy Business Alliance to decarbonize any blockchain. There are resources for those who want to access renewable energy sources and high-quality carbon offsets. Other options include using inherently low-carbon technologies like the XRP Ledger that don’t rely on proof-of-work (which involves mining) to help significantly reduce emissions for blockchains and cryptofinance.

The XRP Ledger is carbon-neutral and uses a validation and security algorithm called Federated Consensus that is approximately 120000 times more energy-efficient than proof-of-work. Ethereum the second-largest blockchain is transitioning off proof-of-work to a much less energy-intensive validation mechanism called proof-of-stake. Proof-of-work systems are inefficient by design and as such will always require more energy to maintain forward progress.

The devastating impact of climate change is moving at an alarming speed. Making aspirational commitments to sustainability — or worse denying the problem — isn’t enough. As with the Paris agreement the industry needs real targets collective action innovation and shared accountability.

The good news? Solutions can be practical market-driven and create value and growth for all.

The inspiring story of a former janitor who created Flamin’ Hot Cheetos has crumbled into dust after Frito-Lay said the tale was not true. However a movie about the story is going forward.

According to a report from the Los Angeles Times Richard Montañez has spun a yarn about rising from a janitor to an executive at Frito-Lay and inspired by Mexican-style street corn inventing Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. In two memoirs and numerous speaking engagements Montañez has claimed to have taken the idea to the CEO of Frito-Lay and the rest is (completely fabricated) history.

Richard Montanez VP Branding and Sales PepsiCo speaks during the grand opening of the Art Gallery at Tamayo on Friday May 3 2013 in Los Angeles Calif.

The company looked into Montañez’s story after former employee Lynne Greenfeld asked why she wasn’t given any credit for coming up with the snack item’s name in 1989.

“None of our records show that Richard was involved in any capacity in the Flamin’ Hot test market” Frito-Lay wrote in a statement to the Times. “That doesn’t mean we don’t celebrate Richard but the facts do not support the urban legend. We value Richard’s many contributions to our company especially his insights into Hispanic consumers but we do not credit the creation of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos or any Flamin’ Hot products to him.”

The inspiring story of a former janitor who created Flamin’ Hot Cheetos has crumbled into dust after Frito-Lay said the tale was not true. However a movie about the story is going forward.

Producers of “Flamin’ Hot” an upcoming film about Montañez’s story which is set to be directed by Eva Longoria said there are no plans to ditch the movie idea.

“My biggest priority to make sure we are telling Richard Montañez’s story authentically. I am so happy to have two extremely talented and fellow Mexican Americans on board in these pivotal roles. Jesse (Garcia) and Annie (Gonzalez) have a deep understanding of our community and will be able to help tell this story of great importance for our culture” Longoria previously told Variety.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1icmFuZC9oYXBweS1tb25leXMtc2FkaXJhLWZ1cmxvdy1zaGFyZXMtaGVyLWZhaXRoLWZ1ZWxlZC1sZWFwcy1vbi10aGUtcGF0aC10by1jbW8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy Money's Sadira Furlow Shares Her Faith-fueled Leaps on the Path to CMO,"Be among trailblazing marketing pros at Brandweek this September 23–26 in Phoenix Arizona.

Her current position at fintech start-up Happy Money may be Sadira Furlow’s first-ever CMO role (and this her first-ever podcast!) but don’t let the rookie façade fool you. The 2020 Brand Genius honoree has a string of noteworthy career achievements under her belt including viral Superbowl campaigns like Mountain Dew’s “PuppyMonkeyBaby” and one of her proudest career wins in building from the ground up PepsiCo’s first premium water brand LifeWTR.

This episode is also available on Spotify iHeartRadio and Apple Podcasts.

She’s also an incredibly humble leader whose path to CMO was far from expected. What started as a career to become an orthopedic surgeon shifted to an “in-between” dip into the advertising world which unlocked Sadira’s passion for creativity and the ability to use that creativity to change consumer behavior.

But what truly led to Sadira on the path to CMO was the combination of risk and faith. She attributes beginning her walk with God at age 34 to being the catalyst for the life and career leaps she’s taken since. And part of those risks include her taking on some of the most challenging roles and tasks giving her the reputation of a utility player with a robust set of marketing skills in her arsenal.

With those skills she’s building the Happy Money brand house as well as the brand voice through digital content that speaks to consumers in the way that they like to talk about money (debt-hacks anyone?).

So what has she loved most about being a CMO so far? The “pressure and permission to evolve.” Sadira firmly believes that the push and ability to change along with the dynamic environment marketers live and breathe every day is a true gift. She also believes that curiosity and empathy are two of the most critical skills for marketers today and will continue to be into the future.

Or at the very least be something people might have heard of.

Early in 2020 Lupii’s founders Alexandra Dempster and Isabelle Steichen introduced the small and chewy protein bar made from lupini beans and in flavors like Peanut Butter Cacao Nib and Tahini Lemon Cranberry. Success came early with the bars landing in a handful of specialty and independent grocery stores in New York City yoga studios and even the pantries of New York tech start-ups like Foursquare.

The snack start-up was on the verge of a deal with a distributor that could put its bars on grocery store shelves all over the country. But Lupii’s big moment was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead the two women were left with pallets of Lupii bars stuffed into the corners of their small New York City apartments wondering what to do with them. “How do we get this product that no one has heard of into the market?” Ms. Dempster asked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzLzUtYmVzdC1jZWxlYnJpdHktc3Bva2VzcGVyc29ucy1vZi1hbGwtdGltZS0xMDMwNDMyNjMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Celebrity Spokespersons Of All Time | Markets Insider,"Companies don't really need celebrities to sell their products or brand awareness and not every celebrity is appropriate for these assignments. But when the correct talent is able to connect with audiences there is a magic that transcends mere marketing.

Indeed many companies powered their sales thanks to having the right celebrity in their spotlight.

Here are five of the most successful celebrity endorsement spokespersons. Each one offers a sterling lesson of what the right A-list personality can do for a company's image.

Joan Crawford for Pepsi: The glamorous Hollywood star married Alfred Steele CEO of PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE:PEP) in Las Vegas in May 1955. During the marriage Steele used Crawford’s star wattage to shine a spotlight on his celebrated soft drink.

Steele died of a heart attack in 1959. His successor Herbert L. Barnet appointed her as the first woman on the company’s board of directors which created a flood of media attention.

Although Crawford’s film career in the 1960s saw a decline into horror-thrillers of varying degrees of quality she still captivated the public as an icon of the Golden Age of Hollywood. She traveled across the U.S. and around the world on behalf of the company appearing in promotional films for Pepsi and greeting investors at business conferences. For this period in time Crawford and Pepsi were synonymous to most consumers.

Not everyone in the Pepsi C-suite was enamored with Crawford – women were a rarity in boardrooms and the old boys in charge liked their gender exclusivity – and she was forced to retire in 1973; the notorious 1981 film “Mommie Dearest” greatly exaggerated this segment of her life. Nonetheless Crawford’s work as a corporate brand ambassador and a board director staked out new territory for women to follow.

Karl Malden for American Express: The Oscar-winning character actor’s career gained an adrenaline shot in 1972 when he landed the lead role as a veteran police detective on the TV crime series “The Streets of San Francisco.” The popularity of the series convinced The American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) that Malden’s new persona as a television cop would help promote the safety and security aspects of its travelers checks product.

Beginning in 1973 Malden would appear dressed in the same suit-and-fedora clothing that he wore on “The Streets of San Francisco” while offering micro-dramas of vacationers who abruptly find themselves stranded when their cash is stolen. Malden would explain to the viewer that American Express’ travelers checks could be easily replaced if they were lost or stolen adding the tagline “Don’t Leave Home Without Them” to drive home the point.

Malden’s campaign lasted through 1994 – “The Streets of San Francisco” went off the air in 1977 – and the commercials resonated so greatly in the pop culture that Johnny Carson would frequently parody them on ""The Tonight Show."" In a late-life interview Malden warmly recalled his work with American Express saying “It was a pleasure it was a joy – I loved every minute of it.”

James Garner and Mariette Hartley for Polaroid: This campaign began in 1979 and covered 250 commercials over an eight-year run. Polaroid Corporation initially hired Garner as its spokesperson but his first commercials were too heavy on the salesmanship and lacked charm. The company paired him with Hartley whose career mostly consisted of one-shot roles on TV shows including “Twilight Zone” “Star Trek” and “M*A*S*H*” but she was not a household name.

The commercials offered Garner and Hartley engaging in leisure-time activities – they were on a sailboat anchored in a marina at a stable in a garden unwrapping Christmas decorations – and Garner would photograph Hartley with the Polaroid instant camera. The pair would watch the photograph develop before their eyes all while keeping a good-natured banter.

Many viewers assumed Garner and Hartley were married even though there was nothing in their dialogue to affirm that – Hartley would facetiously acknowledge this public error by creating a t-shirt that read “I am not James Garner’s wife!” Still this was one of the longest running celebrity advertising campaigns of all time and it helped to maintain Polaroid’s market dominance in the pre-digital days.

Michael Jordan for Nike: In 1984 Michael Jordan won a gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympics and was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. His athletic greatness was quickly appreciated but not everyone noticed. Johnson had hoped to snag an endorsement deal with the Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) brand but the company didn’t make any offers. Nor did Converse which already had deals with Larry Bird Magic Johnson and Julius Erving.

Nike (NYSE:NKE) was not Jordan’s preferred choice for a corporate benefactor and an initial meeting at the company’s headquarters in Beaverton Oregon left him underwhelmed. But the company’s $500000 five-year contract changed his mind.

The rest as is often said is history – the Air Jordan sneaker brand from Nike generated $126 million in sales in its first 12 months the market. In Q2 FY2019 the brand recorded more than $1 billion in sales a first for sports footwear. The 2020 documentary series “The Last Dance” put Jordan back in the spotlight and reanimated sales of the sneaker. In Nike’s case Jordan was the gift that keeps on giving.

Elizabeth Taylor for Elizabeth Arden: In 1991 Elizabeth Arden announced a deal with movie star Elizabeth Taylor on a new perfume called White Diamonds. The product was not marketed as a run-of-the-mill scent – the company first sold White Diamonds at $200 an ounce in an exclusive launch at New York’s Marshall Field & Co department store and the first 150 customers who purchased a $300-an-ounce limited edition version were treated to a private tea party with the one-time big-screen Cleopatra.

There were perfumes tied to celebrities before White Diamonds hit the market. But as the blog Fashionista observed about Taylor’s star power: “While she certainly wasn't the first celebrity to come out with a scent she was the first to do it well.”

The success of White Diamonds stirred a whirlpool within the cosmetics industry and companies began paying considerable sums to sign various actors singers and athletes to put their name and image on bottles of perfume and cologne. Still Taylor’s celebrity influence reigned the strongest – when she died in 2011 20 years after the product debuted its global sales were $61.3 million a top-seller for Elizabeth Arden.

Elizabeth Arden was acquired in 2016 by Revlon Inc. (NYSE:REV) but the new owners were not eager to jettison the brand. Today White Diamonds is still bringing in revenue for Revlon and Elizabeth Taylor’s name remains prominently displayed on the packaging.

It would seem that some stars never fade away.

The team – from Gladstone Institute of Virology in San Francisco and the University of California – also provided evidence that individuals who receive one vaccine dose after having recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection may not require a second dose.

Furthermore Nadia Roan and colleagues showed that in previously infected individuals vaccination might induce more persistent homing of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to the respiratory tract than in previously uninfected individuals.

“We find a reassuringly unaltered T cell response against the variants and a striking impact of prior infection on qualitative features of T cells elicited by vaccination” writes the team.

Concerns about vaccine efficacy against variants

Since the COVID-19 outbreak first began in late December 2019 intense efforts to develop and clinically test vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 quickly resulted in the emergency use authorization of several mRNA-based vaccines.

Although the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have proved highly effective at protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection concerns have arisen regarding the extent to which they can protect against the new variants that are now quickly spreading across the globe.

The antibodies generated following vaccination generally remain as potent against the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the UK as they are against the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. However studies have also shown the antibodies to be less effective against the B.1.351 lineage that emerged in South Africa and the P.1 variant that emerged in Brazil.

It is also not clear how booster doses and prior infection might influence the vaccine-elicited immunity.

T cell-mediated immunity seems to be less prone to evasion

Reassuringly early studies have suggested that T cell-mediated immunity appears to be less prone to evasion by the variants.

“The relative resistance of T cells against SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion is important in light of the critical role these immune effectors play during COVID-19” says Roan and colleagues. “T cell numbers display a strong inverse association with disease severity and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predicts recovery from severe disease.”

T cells may also be the key to long-term immune memory due to their ability to persist for decades adds the team.

Furthermore studies of the antibody and B cell response to infection suggest that for COVID-19 convalescents one dose of an mRNA vaccine is beneficial but that a second booster jab is not necessary.

However “how this translates in the context of vaccine-elicited T cell immunity is not clear” says Roan and colleagues.

What did the researchers do?

The team conducted a longitudinal study of eight mRNA-vaccinated individuals four of whom had recovered from COVID-19 and four of whom were infection-naïve. The researchers conducted a T-cell centric CyTOF (cytometry by time-of-flight) analysis to phenotype participants’ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells.

Three of the participants had received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and the remaining five had received the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine.

For each of the 24 samples obtained the researchers assessed phenotype and effector function of T cells responding to the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the spikes of the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants.

The spike protein is the main structure the virus uses to infect host cells and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies following vaccination.

What did they find?

Vaccination-elicited T cells responded similarly to spike epitopes from the ancestral strain and the variants. The phenotypic features of these cells were identical across the different strains.

“That both the quantity and quality of T cell responses is maintained against the variants may provide an explanation for the real-world efficacy of the vaccines against variants” says the team.

Among the infection-naïve individuals a second dose boosted the quantity although not the quality of the spike-specific responses.

The researchers say this highlights the importance of ensuring a second dose is administered to infection-naïve individuals.

Among the convalescent participants however there was again no evidence of phenotypic changes in the spike-specific T cells following a second dose but there was also no evidence of boosted T cell numbers.

“Our results suggest that a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may provide less benefit than in individuals who have not previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2” says Roen and colleagues.

Differences in phenotypes between convalescent versus infection-naïve vaccinees

The researchers say that one of the most striking findings was the remarkably distinct phenotypes of the spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees versus infection-naïve vaccinees.

The spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent individuals exhibited features indicating the increased potential for long-term persistence including the elevated expression of CD127 – a marker of long-lived memory T cells.

Compared with infection-naïve vaccinees CD4+ T cells from the nasopharynx of the upper respiratory tract in convalescent individuals also expressed multiple tissue-homing receptors.

What are the implications of the study?

“All together these results imply that compared to infection-naïve individuals convalescents’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells may be superior in surviving and migrating to the respiratory tract” write the researchers.

Referring to the findings overall the team says “these results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2- specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.”

Our problem is that we aim too low and hit’’' Bourla told recipients of graduate degrees at the virtual commencement ceremony.

Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla urged Babson College graduates on Saturday to set ambitious goals invoking a famous philosopher from his native Greece and citing his own firm’s development of the first coronavirus vaccine cleared in the United States.

While that might seem a daunting challenge Bourla said it’s actually liberating. As evidence he cited the messenger RNA vaccine that the New York pharmaceutical giant got authorized for emergency use in record time on Dec. 11 the first of three coronavirus vaccines cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

“If we had asked our scientists to find ways to develop the vaccine in eight years instead of the 10 that it usually takes they would have found it very difficult and likely would have tried to achieve it by improving the existing process” said Bourla who also serves as Pfizer’s chairman. “But we asked them to do it in eight months not eight years.

“And if we had asked our engineers to manufacture 250 million doses within a year they would try to do it by improving the way we already work. But we asked them to make two and a half billion doses. Both groups recognized immediately that simply making improvements wouldn’t bring them even close to achieving these goals.”

Pfizer employees “needed to think far out of the box and design completely new ways of working and that’s exactly what they did” said Bourla who received an honorary doctor of laws degree at the ceremony.

As of Friday more than 143 million doses of the mRNA vaccine that Pfizer developed with its German partner BioNTech had been administered in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compared with more than 115 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine and more than 9 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine.

Pfizer and Babson have collaborated on customized management development programs including a corporate certificate in advanced management and a corporate MBA degree for Pfizer employees.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Shannon Saile remained undefeated in the circle improving her record to 16-0. She pitched 4.2 innings and gave up two earned runs off of six hits with four strikeouts and two walks. Nicole May relieved Saile for the last 1.1 innings with a clean sheet. OU didn’t commit an error and was aided in the field by two spectacular catches from CF Jayda Coleman.



Both of OSU’s scores were off of home runs as Naomi Kiley and Alysen Febrey hit solo shots in the top of the fifth. In her 27th appearance of the season Carrie Eberle suffered just her third loss (21-3). Kelly Maxwell gave up the final two runs in the bottom of the sixth.



Hansen was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Championship after hitting five homers in three games. She knocked in eight runs and scored six herself with a 2.100 slugging percentage. The entire All-Tournament Team is listed below.

Day 2 Pool Play Recaps

Game 7: No. 5 Iowa State 3 No. 4 Baylor 1

No. 5 seed Iowa State won the third place pool play game in the Phillips 66 Big 12 Softball Championship after a 3-1 win over No. 4 seed Baylor. Lou Gilbert scored the only run for the Bears off an RBI double from Emily Hott in the bottom of the first. The Cyclones’ offense came alive when Carli Spelhaug hit an RBI double in the top of the fifth to put ISU on top. Mikayla Ramos added an RBI in the seventh as she batted in Sami Williams. Earlier in the game Williams became the Big 12's all-time leader in career hits with 329.



Game 8: No. 6 Texas Tech 5 No. 3 Texas 1

No. 6 seed Texas Tech upset No. 3 seed Texas 5-1 to claim the second place pool play game in the Phillips 66 big 12 Softball Championship. The Red Raiders were quick to get the offense rolling putting a run on the board in the first inning and again in the top of the third. The Longhorns’ Colleen Sullivan cut into the Red Raiders’ lead when she hit a solo homer in the bottom of the fourth. Tech responded with three runs on three hits in the top of the fifth to complete the win. It marked TTU’s second Big 12 postseason win over the Longhorns in seven meetings. The last Red Raider win 8-4 came in 2000 when like this year Tech was a 6 seed and Texas was a 3.

The endowment given by the Phillips family was created to recognize paper science and engineering students who show a strong interest in business and professional success. The recipients of this award are to demonstrate academic achievement strong leadership and service within their community. This leadership incentive allows for paper science and engineering students to pursue a business administration minor from the Poole College of Management at NC State.

Before coming to NC State Dr. Phillips retired as the Senior Vice President – Technology and Manufacturing from International Paper. Dr. Phillips is currently an Adjunct Professor and the Executive in Residence in the Department of Forest Biomaterials at NC State. He teaches and consults with our faculty staff and students to elevate the level of our courses and curricula research teaching and outreach. He is also an expert consultant in our industry.

Making Futures Brighter

Each spring rising juniors and seniors are given the opportunity to apply for this prestigious award. This year the Phillips Family Leadership Incentive was awarded to four outstanding students in the Paper Science and Engineering program. Congratulations to our 2021-2022 recipients Kyra Attridge Tressa Glackin Matthew Klassa & Natalie Laux.

Kyra Attridge

I first learned of the Phillips Family Leadership Incentive my junior year of high school when I toured my local paper mill and was introduced to the PSE program at NC State. Not only did I fall in love with the paper industry that day but I also learned the impact having a strong foundation in business can have on an engineer. In my 12 months of work experiences while what I have learned in my paper classes has made me a good intern my deeper understanding of the ins and outs of the industry from my business classes have made me a good engineer. I am immensely honored to be recognized as a leader in our program and to have received this award and am equally grateful to Dr. Phillips and his family.

As an out-of-state and first-generation college student this award is removing the financial burden of my senior year allowing me to focus on academics and embrace my final stretch of undergrad before emerging into the workforce. Thanks to the Phillips’ generosity I will now also have the economic freedom to further my business education and pursue an MBA later in my career. I am also looking forward to developing as a professional by working closely with Dr. Phillips on a business-related project. Between the skills I develop from the project the knowledge from my engineering and business classes and my work experience I will be able to quickly progress in my career into a managerial position. I could not be more thankful for receiving this scholarship and all the other help from our PSE program along the way and am eager to pay it forward.

Tressa Glackin

One important part of paper science is how well the program prepares its students to enter and excel in industry which includes moving up to management positions within mills. I knew even in my freshman year that my career goals included fulfilling those expectations and becoming a leader in a mill and in industry and that learning about business would help accomplish this. The service aspect of this award is also incredibly important to me because I know how prevalent teamwork is within the pulp and paper industry and I know that I could not have gotten where I am today without the help and support of all the people in my life. This award is an incredible opportunity to continue pursuing that knowledge and to become even more involved with the PSE program.

As an out of state student especially one with siblings that have also gone through college and even continued their education beyond undergrad I cannot even begin to explain how financially helpful this award is. I am so honored to be selected as a recipient and I look forward to continuing to learn more about leadership service and professional success.

Matthew Klassa

Being selected as one of this year’s recipients is a significant honor for me. When I entered college I looked up to the student leaders in our program who received this award. I aspired to serve our campus community and give back to our program like they had done but I never fully believed that I was capable of serving and leading as much as they did. However to be selected as one of this year’s recipients gives me a fresh boost of confidence. It is incredibly gratifying to be recognized by my professors and fellow volunteers. Additionally it also reminds me of my obligation to continue serving and acting as a role model for incoming students. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and honor!

Furthermore one of my professional goals is to be a leader in our industry and this award will help me to achieve this. By enabling me to add a business minor to my dual degree this award gives me the opportunity to gain a basic understanding of the different aspects of businesses. This type of understanding will prove invaluable in earning the trust of my future peers and mentors. I can build on this foundation of trust to lead and serve in my future roles. While this award will significantly help me in the immediate future financially perhaps even more importantly it will set me up for success in reaching my long-term goals.

Natalie Laux

Coming up on my final year here at NC State I have taken some time to reflect on my journey here and those who have traveled it with me. With that comes the need to thank my family who has supported me in all my endeavors and the PSE program who has become my family and helped me to grow and learn in ways I never could have imagined.

Whenever I tell someone that I am majoring in Paper Science Engineering they generally ask what it is and how I found it. As far as the how part of that question goes well I did not find it but rather it found me. I did not know what I was going to do past the idea of being an engineer but once I was introduced to the world of paper I fell in love. In love with the chemistry the complicated manufacturing process the faculty and all the students that made NC State feel like home. Without PSE I do not know where I would be right now but I cannot imagine anything better than where I am.

The opportunity to apply for scholarships specific to my field has been an immense assistance to me personally. As someone paying for their own education a huge scholarship like this is simply unimaginable and a huge blessing. With the financial assistance of this scholarship I will be able to continue my involvement and leadership with TAPPI and my campus ministry while graduating debt-free. Thank you to everyone who makes this endowment possible. It means more than you can imagine.

A Sincere Thank you…

Our paper science and engineering program is truly made world class by the many individuals and companies who give of their time talents and treasures. A sincere thank you is in order for Dr. Phillips and his family for this generous and creative endowment. This scholarship has increased the awareness and need for engineers with business skills and significantly impacted the number of students pursing business minors and courses.

Much much taller than the 6-foot-10 frame that — in the glory days of his athletic heyday — he pushed around a basketball court like a titanic dynamic force.

He once scored 48 points for Tennessee Tech — a record that held up for 54 years.

He challenged Ohio State marvel — and future NBA superstar — Oscar Robertson for the 1958-59 college national scoring title. He ended up third in the country at 28.8 points per game — and also averaged 18.2 rebounds per game and shot 83 percent from the free throw line.

He remains the only TTU Tech Golden Eagle roundballer to be named an All-American in two different seasons.

The Minneapolis Lakers picked him in the 1960 draft — their second selection following Hall-of-Famer in-embryo Jerry West. But this man spurned pro basketball.

He sought career stability and the family life chose to come to work for Phillips Petroleum and play for the Phillips 66ers in elite amateur men's play — and capped his career by being named an AAU All-American back when that honor was akin to being a NBA All-Star.

But this man — this 82-inch colossal talent — won't be best remembered for what he did on the hardwood. But rather for his Brobdingnagian love of his family and of life.

He closed his eyes for the final time on May 4 at age 83. But the glow of his vision continues to live in the hearts of his wife children grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

""His dad was injured"" his son James Hagan Jr. said last week during a conversation with the E-E. ""A beam fell on his arm and it ended up making it where he couldn't go and play catch with his son. … That hit him pretty hard. … Once when he was talking about it he even had a tear come to his eyes.""

But Hagan Sr. and his parents forged a loving unit despite a hard life. Or perhaps because of it.

His father would die in the 1970's when Hagan Sr. was just 38. His mom would live until 2017 and age 103.

""They were dirt poor"" Hagan Jr. said about his father and grandparents. ""He'd wake up early in the morning and he'd take his milk bucket with him and go milk. They had several crops corn tobacco everything. They did their own meats with chicks cows and pigs. His life was busy working there at the farm going to school and playing ball. … If he wouldn't have worked so hard on the court playing basketball he probably wouldn't gotten a scholarship and probably ended up not going to college.""

Sixty-five years after Hagan first stepped on the TTU court he still owns four

single-season team records and three career marks including highest scoring average (21.1 ppg) and rebound average (15.2 rpg).

Hagan Sr. would be inducted in 1979 into the Tennessee Tech Sports Hall of Fame. He is one of only four Golden Eagle players to have their numbers retired.

Coming out of college he was honored by playing in the prestigious Shrine East-West All-Star game at Madison Square Garden — arguably the highest prize for an graduating senior player back then other than being selected for the Olympics. In the Shrine game Hagan played for the East squad which also included West and Lenny Wilkens.

The East won by one point.

Even though off the court Hagan Sr. exuded a mild and friendly aura he transformed into a fierce competitor once the whistle blew.

""He was what we could consider a gentle giant"" the younger Hagan said. ""He was very kind and considerate of other people. … But when he was on the court it was all business. … He loved to score.""

Hagan Jr. recalled seeing his dad play in the Phillips Gymnasium in a town team tournament.

""He had to be around his late 30's"" he said. ""He was playing against a young kid from Kansas State who was 6-foot-8 or 6-foot-9. I will never forget watching him play against that young man who was getting frustrated. Dad had this tremendous hook shot which he could shoot right or left-handed. … He was doing his moves inside and really used that hook shot. I was just 12 or 14 and watching your dad do that when you're a teenager is something special. He just had that touch. He worked so hard on his shot.""

The younger Hagan credited part of his dad's mobility on having been a very good college tennis player as well.

""He had a really good wingspan"" he added. ""He could get around well.""

You can ask people you know and use social media and neighborhood boards to get tips. If your school has a swimming team the coach may also be able to give you some ideas.

Another resource is online search tools such as www.usaswimming.org/makeasplash which allows you to search for swim lesson providers near you. Many of these programs also offer options for free or reduced-cost swim lessons. The USA Swimming Foundation is committed to making sure everyone has access to swim lessons regardless of ability to pay. Don’t let financial hardship keep your friends and family from learning this valuable life skill.

Once you identify a program visit the facility with your child to see how swim lessons are run.

Find out who your child’s teacher will be and whether it’s possible to meet him or her in advance.

Learn the program expectations for you as a parent or guardian.

Inquire about the provider’s approach and learn-to-swim philosophy.

Ask about the facility’s COVID mitigation protocols. Swim lessons can be safely administered with proper protective equipment and procedures.

A nationally recognized learn-to-swim curriculum or an independently developed learn-to-swim curriculum that follows a similar model.

Trained and certified instructors with on-deck lifeguards holding current CPR and first aid certifications.

A maximum 6-to-1 student-to-instructor ratio for group lessons.

Minimum of 30 minutes per week of in-water instruction with a minimum total in-water instruction time of four hours.

Written and practiced emergency action plans.

Regulation of the facility and water by the Department of Health or similar governing agency.

Established and practiced child-protection policies.

Screening and background checks on all staff members

Playing in or around the water is one of the joys of summer but this treasured seasonal pastime comes with some serious risks. Drowning is the second-leading cause of accidental death for children under the age of 14 in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.As COVID-19 restrictions ease families will be having more informal gatherings and trips to the beach increasing the potential for children to have unsupervised access to water sources. So it’s important that children have swimming lessons to teach them water safety skills and to create safer habits in and around a variety of water sources. As swimming lessons begin across the country many are being conducted safely with COVID-19 precautions in place.Protect your family’s safety around water this summer with these tips from the Make a Splash Tour presented by Phillips 66 and the USA Swimming Foundation.Designate a Water Watcher and Supervise Children Closely. Designate a water watcher when you are in on or around water. Watch all children and adolescents swimming or playing in or around water even if they know how to swim. Keeping young children or inexperienced swimmers within arm’s length at all times can help ensure you’re able to provide assistance if and when it’s needed.Wear a Life Jacket. Anyone participating in any boating paddling or towed water sport regardless of swimming ability (in particular preschool-aged children those 5 years and younger who are not protected by touch supervision) in pool or open water situations should wear a Coast Guard-approved lifejacket. Swimming aids and water toys such as water wings and inflatable water wings and rings are just toys and not intended to be lifesaving devices. They may provide some buoyancy in the water but they do not prevent drowning.Swim with a Buddy. When possible choose swimming locations where a trained lifeguard is watching for dangerous conditions and helping keep an eye on swimmers. Also make it a practice to always have at least two people swimming together. That way if someone has a problem the other can get help.Learn to Swim. Research has shown formal swimming lessons reduce the risk of childhood drowning by 88%. The USA Swimming Foundation with the support of Phillips 66 encourages children’s swim lessons through their annual Make a Splash Tour. Studies show that swim lessons save lives. By equipping your child with the skill of swimming you’ll open doors to a lifetime of safety and fun fitness and even employment opportunities.While lessons progressively teach a variety of swimming strokes the most important things swimmers learn - even in beginner classes - are breath control and how to float. These basic skills are essential for staying above water should someone find themselves unable to touch or too tired to swim to safety. Children can participate in swimming lessons before they can walk and parent-child swim lessons provide bonding opportunities along with water safety education.Enter Water Feet First. Diving in a pool that is too shallow or into water where you’re not certain what’s below the surface like a lake can have dire consequences. Teach children to dive only in designated diving areas and to always enter water of unknown or non-visible depth feet first.Swim in Designated Areas and Obey Posted Signs and Flags. Ropes buoys and flags in larger bodies of water like lakes or oceans are commonly used to mark off safe swimming areas and provide visual cues about changes in depth underwater surfaces and currents. Teach children what these signs and markers mean and that they’re in place as a safety tool not a toy to play with or float on.Learn CPR. If the unthinkable does happen knowing how to perform CPR allows you to take immediate action which has been shown to significantly better the outcome for children with submersion injury. In the time it takes for paramedics to arrive you could save someone’s life. Seconds count the more quickly lifesaving CPR is started the better the chances of recovery. There are many places that offer CPR training including community organizations and nonprofit groups. You can also check with organizations such as the American Red Cross and American Heart Association directly for local course offerings. Remember to keep your certification current once you have completed the initial requirements.Make safety a priority for your summer water fun.

Archer was making his first competitive appearance since England's IT20 series against India in March having undergone surgery to remove a piece of glass from his hand.

The elbow injury is a longstanding issue for Archer and led to him missing two of England's Test matches in India earlier this year as well as games in South Africa at the start of 2020.

England's two-Test series against New Zealand starts at Lord's on June 2.

Having taken two wickets in the first innings of the match at Hove Archer bowled only five overs in Kent's second innings and following some confusion when Sussex captain Ben Brown seemed to want the 26-year-old England man to open the bowling from the Sea End on day three he did not bowl at all on Saturday.

""I think there was some confusion about the state of Jofra's [right] elbow"" Salisbury told reporters. ""Ben thought he was going to bowl but his elbow was sore and there was confusion over that and he couldn't bowl.

""He wants to win games of cricket for Sussex as does Ben. That's where his disappointment was.

""We're desperate to win this game against our local rivals. Ben is a passionate guy and he desperately wants to win this game for his team.

""You'll have to ask the ECB. Any time that Jofra can't bowl you're going to be frustrated as a leader or as a team.

""But it happens. In sport people get injured. That's life. That's sport. He's still willing to be out there because he wants Sussex to win.

""They [the ECB] had to give him permission to play this game. He's not our player so they had to give permission.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thankfully a floating pool of another sort is slated to open in (yes IN!) New York City's East River within two years. The pool which is dubbed + POOL due in part to its shape has officially received a “confirmation to proceed with due diligence” from the City of New York and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC).

If the unique plus sign shape of the floating pool already has you intrigued the + POOL boasts yet another truly unique feature. According to the + POOL website the pool is ""designed to filter the very river that it floats in through the walls of the pool.""

""+ POOL strives to reclaim the river as a recreational resource for the city while educating the public about issues affecting our water quality"" the + POOL website reads.

According to Architectural Digest the idea for the floating pool was originally conceived by Archie Lee Coates IV and Jeff Franklin of the design firm PlayLab and Dong-Ping Wong and Oana Stanescu of the architecture firm Family well over a decade ago. In the years since the idea was conceived the team has worked to raise funds develop filtration systems test the filtration systems and more.

If construction for + POOL goes smoothly and the appropriate funds are raised New Yorkers can expect to dive in within about two years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

In April Americans would celebrate the first Earth Day marking the dawn of the global environmental movement. In Washington the White House was finalizing plans for a new Environmental Protection Agency and Clean Air Act. General Motors had just promised “pollution-free cars” by 1980. And 50 miles south of Los Angeles Irvine Company executives were unfurling plans for a brand-new green city.

The City of Irvine was rigorously designed to be the heart of an environment “where nature and man both prosper” as the Company announced in an enthusiastic press release on March 19 1970. The blueprint delivered that day to Orange County planners included an unusual promise: Irvine residents “will live in an environment that is as attractive as balanced and as enduring as the science of urban planning can make it.”

This was a striking commitment even in the context of that era’s green ambitions. Yet it arose from a singular set of circumstances. A single corporation held claim to 93000 acres of undeveloped land – six times the size of Manhattan – and had determined to maintain control of it master-planning its development.

Irvine was neither the first nor the largest modern city to be designed from the ground up. More than two centuries earlier Washington D.C. was planned by the French former revolutionary fighter Pierre Charles L’Enfant. Brasilia Brazil’s brand-new master-planned capital was inaugurated in 1960.

And in 1964 while Irvine was still on the drawing board the small woodsy town of Reston Virginia planned by a New York developer would become known as a pioneering effort to avoid the miseries of suburban sprawl.

Still Irvine was special in one major way. Its fortune in having a single owner for the city’s land and its natural surroundings would pave the way for a long-lasting and mutually rewarding collaboration between a private company and local City Council members.

On Dec. 28 1971 Irvine’s 10000 inhabitants embraced their good luck overwhelmingly voting to incorporate as a new city.

The Founding Father

Irvine is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. But the city’s unique history began more than 100 years earlier.

In 1846 James Irvine then an impoverished 19-year-old immigrant arrived in New York fleeing the Irish potato famine. After making his way to San Francisco he sold food and provisions to gold rush miners and made his fortune by investing in real estate. At age 37 Irvine headed to Southern California where he discovered what he called the “most delightful” land he had ever seen in or out of the state. The Irvine Company dates its start from 1864 when Irvine and two partners whom he later bought out began acquiring vast tracts of former Spanish and Mexican land grants. These would include the 93000-acre Irvine Ranch today just an hour’s drive south of downtown Los Angeles.

Priceless Pristine Land

Thanks to a long line of conscientious stewards much of the land that first enchanted James Irvine more than 150 years ago still looks a lot like it did then. Descendants of the eagles hawks mountain lions badgers and scores of species of butterflies that Irvine saw on his first horseback forays still make the Ranch their home.

The Ranch stretches for 9 miles along the Pacific Coast and 22 miles inland to the Cleveland National Forest. Its landscapes are as varied as they are often visually stunning ranging from remote canyons and mountain watersheds to grasslands oak woodlands coves and beaches. Its ecological treasures include one of Southern California’s largest coastal freshwater marshes and the 5500-acre Limestone Canyon home to a striking geological formation called the “Sinks” sometimes compared to a miniature Grand Canyon.

The Ranch belongs to one of the world’s few regions with a Mediterranean climate of mild winters and warm summers. Scientists have distinguished the area as one of 36 biodiversity “hot spots” due to its wealth of rare and vulnerable plant and animal species. The list of flora and fauna endemic to this corner of the continent includes Tecate cypress trees the Nutall’s woodpecker and the endangered California gnatcatcher a songbird that lives in coastal sage scrub.

The Ranch property encompasses roughly one-fifth of modern Orange County home to more than 3 million people and many more millions of yearly visitors drawn by attractions including Disneyland and some of the world’s most beautiful beaches. The Irvine Company initially used the land to raise cattle and sheep but later expanded into agriculture. By 1910 the Ranch was the most productive agricultural location in California expanding into crops including oranges cauliflower and grapes.

Still the land had a much more unusual destiny in store.

A Struggle to Stop Smog and Sprawl

By the 1950s the outside world was starting to intrude on James Irvine’s paradise. Marines and other members of the military from all over the country who had been trained or stationed in Southern California during World War II had fallen in love with the climate and scenery and brought their families west to start new lives. A frenzy of freeway building made it easier for those with jobs in Los Angeles to commute to homes near forests and fresh air. But now in many parts of the region smog and traffic had reached appalling levels. From 1950 to 1987 Orange County’s population multiplied tenfold from roughly 200000 to more than 2 million. Urban sprawl from the north and west was approaching like “oozing molasses” in the words of one Irvine Company executive.

The rapidly growing population put pressure on the Company to subdivide and sell off its properties. Surrounding cities including Newport Beach and Santa Ana sought to annex some of the land. The Company resisted seeking an alternative solution. It found one in 1959 thanks to an already-celebrated architect named William Pereira. University of California regents had hired Pereira to find a site for a new campus. He took them on a tour of 23 sites ending with the one he liked best: The Irvine Ranch. Pereira already had a larger plan in mind. He envisioned a 1000-acre university within a “city of intellect” free from “the tragedies of helter-skelter planning of the impossible traffic the sprawling disorganization” he had seen all over California. He proposed creating a series of master-planned villages where resident families would be able to walk to schools and shopping leaving their cars in their garages.

Architecture critic Alan Hess who was such a fan of Irvine’s Master Plan that he made his home here in 2004 would call it the “largest most successful application of important progressive planning ideas since 1900.”

The Irvine Company embraced Pereira’s concept and in September 1960 transferred title to 1000 acres to the UC system for a symbolic fee of $1 a gesture required by the terms of the Company’s charter. The land sale marked a fundamental change for the Company requiring it to be “proactive rather than reactive in the Ranch’s transformation from its agricultural past to its urban future” as one executive expressed it. In the process the Company assumed a new long-term role as “Master Community Builder.”

Three years later as the bulldozers graders and carpenters went to work Time magazine put Pereira’s portrait on its cover a distinction shared that year by the likes of Muhammad Ali and Robert Kennedy. The magazine praised Pereira for his “early environmental awareness.” The architect understood that the new city had to be a financial success but also hoped it would serve as a model for a more civilized lifestyle with more respect for nature than U.S. suburbs had yet produced.

A Blueprint for a Green Utopia

Irvine Company planners shared Pereira’s hope of combatting what one of them called “a crisis of the spirit” in American suburbs.

“In the smaller towns monotony is king. In the larger cities the scattering of major community facilities has created an urban sprawl with which it is impossible for any man to identify” the 1970 press release said.

The new city would be “totally master-planned” from its roads to its utilities to its homes factories and schools anticipating needs more than 30 years in the future. Its hub would be the campus of the new University of California Irvine with spokes extending into the surrounding residential area. Irvine’s most distinctive characteristic would be self-contained residential “villages” linked by forested corridors. This would greatly reduce dependence on cars as Pereira envisioned because within a 10-minute walk along a greenbelt residents could reach destinations including an elementary school playground recreation center and community pools. At maximum they would walk 15 minutes to reach a shopping center with a market restaurants hardware store banks and barbershop.

Architecture critic Alan Hess who was such a fan of Irvine’s Master Plan that he made his home here in 2004 would call it the “largest most successful application of important progressive planning ideas since 1900.” Many other future residents just liked what they saw: a distinctively family-friendly and environmentall smart city. In September 1976 more than 7000 prospective buyers competed in a lottery for the first 221 homes for sale in the new village of Woodbridge.

Oliver Kazunga Senior Business Reporter

THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is among the 10 Central Banks within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) whose employees have been trained to prevent bank failures.

The capacity building programme was recently conducted by the Comesa Monetary Institute focused on new accounting principles for financial instruments to prevent bank failures.

Zimbabwe’s banking sector has in recent years remained in solid position due to tight supervision of the banking sector on adherence to good corporate governance practices by the monetary authorities.

“In an initiative to prevent failure of banks which is common in the Comesa region Comesa Monetary Institute has trained over 50 staff from 10 Central Banks in the region on new accounting principles for financial instruments” said Comesa in a statement.

Other Central Banks’ staff from Comesa member States that attended the training programme include the Democratic Republic of Congo Egypt Kenya Libya Malawi Mauritius Tunisia Uganda and Zambia.

Comesa Monetary Institute director Mr Ibrahim Zeidy was quoted saying the training was motivated by recurrent bank failures in the Comesa region like in many parts of the world due to poor credit risk management frameworks and practices.

“The Basel Committee on banking supervision’s principles for management of credit risk recommends that banks should have an effective system in place to identify measure monitor and control credit risk as part of an overall approach to risk management” he said.

The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters.

It is believed that after the training participants will be able to recognise impairment of financial instruments and offer a practical hands-on knowledge on how to review internal capital adequacy.

In this context they will be able to identify and assess credit risks by the banking system in their respective countries. The training also empowered participants to measure expected credit loss and the impact on banks’ financial statements.

Meanwhile the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has put in place policy measures that are meant to ensure the failure or collapse of a domestic systemically important bank does not lead to economic or social costs to people beyond the shareholders creditors and employees of the distressed institution.

The framework is also meant to make sure that the fall of a domestic systematically important bank does not lead to a market wide disruption in the provision of financial services.

A domestic systematically important bank (D-SIB) is a banking institution whose sheer size and unique product offerings makes it systemically important thereby presenting potential risks to the entire system and the real economy in the event of getting into distress.

Such banking institutions according to the RBZ are sizeable highly interconnected with less substitutable products or high complexity and their failure can lead to the paralysis of the economy.

The spillover effects of their collapse include disruption in the availability of financial services or supply of credit to the economy directly to the extent that other banking institutions may not quickly fill the void. – @okazunga",,,,,,

Next year the G-Men will be in the Mahoning Valley Athletic Conference and longtime coach John Bennett will be enjoying retirement.

Next year the Rovers will be right back in the Portage Trail Conference and longtime coach Larry Bailey will still be running with kids through the school parking lot (and schooling others in pickup basketball).

On Friday they met one last time with a league title on the line and split the trophies as the longtime rivals finished 1-2 on the boys and girls sides.

The Garfield boys amassed 184 points with Rootstown coming in second with 126 while the Rovers girls had 170 points and the G-Men took second with 147.

The Garfield boys sent their head coach out of the PTC in style Friday with a dominant performance.

""This boys team is the most unique team I've ever had"" Bennett said. ""We have a sign-out sheet on the bus and they never sign out. All the boys who came ride home on the bus and I got a speaker for Christmas and they play their music through the speaker and they all sing they're all at the back of the bus singing and I've never had a team do that before and it's built up camaraderie.""

The G-Men won 10 events including junior Riley LaPorte sweeping the throws and Ryan Stoller sweeping the hurdles to go with victories in the 4x100 and 4x200 relays.

""It feels beyond amazing to come in here do what we do and almost put 200 points up at the league meet"" Stoller said. ""That's something that I'm not sure any team has done in the past.""

Austin Lysiak tacked on a championship in the 100-meter dash with a 11.53 with Michael Baczkowski finishing right behind him for a combined 18 points. Baczkowski also snagged a title in the 200 with a 23.642.

Additionally Luke Porter won the 400 with a 52.286 Cody Leasure took the 3200 with a 11:00.869 and Jace Cain captured the long jump and nearly broke a school record with a 21-05.25.

""Luke's stepped up for us this year from the last season he's really done a lot for us in the 400 4x4 and the 800"" Stoller said. ""Our senior distance runners Cole (Owens) and Leasure they stepped up they're getting a lot of points in the two mile and mile and such and it's really just a big team effort. We're all so competitive and talented as a team that not only sprints or distance carries (us). We do our part and that is what makes us score 190 points.""

While the Garfield boys won 10 events the Rootstown girls won just four yet still put up 170 points.

How?

Depth depth and more depth.

""The kids stepped up in all the races"" Rovers coach Kyle Rodstrom said. ""The goal was to beat anybody who was from Garfield and just place ahead of them if we can.""

Rootstown did that plenty while racking up plenty of points.

As great as Marinna Atanmo was in edging Lake Center's Medgine Wojton for the 100 title — by just .058 of a second — and as important as it was for Sarah Dresp to edge Faith Mills in the high jump — with both clearing 5-0 but Dresp winning via tiebreaker — Atanmo taking third in the 400 and Aubrey Kline snagging third in the high jump was valuable as well leading to an additional 12 points.

As great as it was for Rootstown's 4x100 to win a title (in 51.306) grabbing runner-up honors in the 4x800 — ahead of rival Garfield — was also key.

As great as it was for sophomore Carlee Clifford to win the 100 hurdles fellow sophomore Porter Smith taking second in the 300 meant another eight points for the Rovers.

Rootstown's flurry of toward-the-top finishes included Kasidy Smith earning runner-up honors in the discus (132-06) and shot put (33-02) for a combined 16 points.

Melanie Plecko tacked on second place in the 200 (27.234) while Mallory Butcher (2nd 13:06.626) and Taylor Monegan (3rd 13:14.211) notched 14 points in the 3200-meter run.

Oh and back to Dresp for a second the senior high jumper's title could be the start of an exciting postseason run as she has been a key contributor in multiple relays as well this season.

""She's a really important part of the team"" Rodstrom said. ""She's like top five in the high jump in the region so she's going to be one that's really going to be focusing on the high jump here and the short relays in the next couple of weeks but she does really well.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc29sYXJxdWFydGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE1L2luZGlhLWxpa2VseS10by1nZXQtaXRzLTNyZC1wb3dlci1leGNoYW5nZS1wc2wtYWZ0ZXItaWV4LXB4aWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India Likely To Get Its 3rd Power Exchange; PSL After IEX & PXIL,"In a recent order CERC approve the petition for registration to establish and operate Power Exchange under Power Market Regulation “The PMR 2010” to PSL a consortium of PTC India Ltd BSE Investment Limited (BSEIL) and ICICI Bank (ICIC) on condition to comply with power market regulations before regulator grants registration.

(Michael Zehnder)

(Seychelles News Agency) - Seychelles' biggest freshwater basin the Mare–aux–Cochons wetland is expected to be rehabilitated to enhance its water storage.

Work on the upland wetland located in the north of the main island of Mahe will start next month and is being done under the Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) to climate change project being implemented in Seychelles since 2015.

""The Mare-aux-Cochons watershed is the biggest river basin in Seychelles and home to the longest river in the country. That said it takes its source in the hills of Glacis D'Antin and Sarcelle snakes toward the wetland before going down through the geological fault of the national park toward Port Launay. The area is very rich in minerals and has several natural cascading dams"" Johan Mendez a consultant of the project told SNA recently.

The wetland is currently one of the main sources of freshwater being used by the island nation's Public Utilities Company for potable water. Mendez added that rehabilitation is needed as the area is invaded by invasive alien species especially along the nature trail. The invasive includes the albizzia trees prune de France cinnamon and bwa ber.

""It will be a forest rehabilitation so selective removal of invasive trees to open up space for native trees that already grow under the canopy. There will be mostly planting of native palms and endemics such as Latanyen Lat Milpat and Auban. Five thousand trees will be planted over six months but mostly seedlings already in place will have the chance to grow"" explained Mendez.

The wetland which lies within the Morne Seychellois National Park was designated a Ramsar site – a wetland of international importance - in 2010. Two other sites in Seychelles also have this recognition: Aldabra Atoll – a UNESCO world heritage site – and Port Launay in the west of Mahe.

Mare–aux–Cochons lies in an area of outstanding natural value. The park's most critical ecological community is the mist forest at higher altitudes and includes several other important habitats including intermediate altitude forest riverine forest open water pools marshes and rivers which are all priorities for conservation.

""The area is home to several potential sites for river water storage such as Bougainville indeed the EBA project identified wetland site valuable for enhancement. This could support our national effort in sustainable development and also move toward less desalination plant for water supply"" added Mendez.

The Ecosystem-Based Adaptation is a project through which Seychelles – 115 islands in the western Indian Ocean - seeks to reduce its vulnerability to the effects of climate change. It is often referred to as the 'natural solution' to climate change. This approach recognises that healthy intact diverse and well-managed ecosystems provide abundant ecosystem services enabling people and societies to adapt to current climate variability and long-term change.

Work on the Mar-aux-Cochons wetland follows the successful rehabilitation of the 'Dan Sours' wetland at Bougainville which now has a capacity of around 15 million litres of water.",,,,,,

Plus it will have a flexible screen. Prior to this the same source disclosed the battery capacity of this phone saying it will reach 4360mAh. At this moment this is all we know about the upcoming smartphone series.

As you should remember back in 2019 Xiaomi and Meitu signed a cooperation agreement. Based on the latter Xiaomi took the management of Meitu’s smartphone business. Soon after this agreement the company announced Xiaomi Mi CC9 series. At the same time the Mi CC9 Pro was the first mass-produced smartphone sporting a 100MP camera. Apart from these two there was the third model the customized version of CC9 Meitu.

It is worth mentioning that as Meitu took back the authorization of Meitu smartphones this year. Reportedly we have heard that Xiaomi had suspended the CC series. But it’s almost a year that we are getting various information concerning the next CC10 line models. Say back in June 2020 we got information that the Xiaomi Mi CC10 will come with a 120x telephoto lens. Shortly after this leak we saw some protective cases that revealed the actual look of the upcoming device. Moreover our protagonist even managed to spot in spy photos.

Xiaomi Mi CC10 Processor

Well today’s leaked information says that the Xiaomi Mi CC10 will sport the Snapdragon 870 chip. As said it’s a pseudo-flagship chip. But prior to this we saw the alleged CC10 Pro leaked on GeekBench using a Snapdragon 865+ chip. So we guess initially the manufacturer has had plans of launching this model earlier and powered by an older chip.

In this regard it’s quite interesting to take a look at the similarities and differences of these two.

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 5G integrates a fast ‘Prime Core’ clocked at 3.2GHz and three additional ARM Cortex-A77 performance cores clocked at 2.42GHz. There are also four power-saving ARM Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8 GHz. Compared to the similar and older Snapdragon 865+ the Prime Core clocks 100 MHz faster and the GPU is slightly higher clocked.

It also integrates a Qualcomm X55 5G modem with Sub-5 and mmWave support and global 5G bands with up to 7.5 GBit/s (download) speed. Plus inside it carries the Adreno 650 GPU which offers a slightly higher clock speed of 670 MHz.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vbW9iaWxlL3Jldmlld3MveGlhb21pLW1pLTExLXVsdHJhLXJldmlldy1hLXdvcnRoeS1mbGFnc2hpcC1waG9uZS03MTYyMTA4MTMzNzM3My5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbW9iaWxlL3Jldmlld3MveGlhb21pLW1pLTExLXVsdHJhLXJldmlldy1hLXdvcnRoeS1mbGFnc2hpcC1waG9uZS03MTYyMTA4MTMzNzM3My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra review: A worthy flagship phone,"Brand: Xiaomi

Product: Mi 11 Ultra

Key specs: 6.81-inch WQHD+ AMOLED Display Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor 5000mAh battery 50-megapixel triple rear cameras.

Price: ₹69999

Rating: 4/5

If you're still doubtful about Xiaomi's premium phones the Mi 11 Ultra may just change your mind. Xiaomi has packed in quite a lot in this phone and it doesn't disappoint. The Mi 11 Ultra is Xiaomi's premium offering with 5G Qualcomm's flagship chipset impressive cameras and even a secondary display.

Xiaomi has priced the Mi 11 Ultra at ₹69999 making it its most expensive phone yet. There are also only two colour options available for the Mi 11 Ultra - black and white. We've been using the Mi 11 Ultra for some time now and here's how our experience has been.

Design display

The first thing that will strike you when you get the phone is it's super heavy. It took us a few days to get used to this bulky device but we were still reminded time and again how heavy it actually was. The phone isn't very portable either especially if you want to just fit it into your pocket. Adding to that is the huge camera bump on the back which also houses the secondary display. Having said that the Mi 11 Ultra is a very good-looking phone.

It has a curved AMOLED display with a punch-hole camera on the top-left corner. You also get Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus protection on top. The display is HDR10+ compliant and has a 120Hz refresh rate. You can also switch between FHD+ and WQHD+ resolutions. Colours are bright and crisp and the clarity is really impressive. It's one of the best displays you'll get on a phone right now.

The secondary display is more of a bonus and a good one. It can display notifications the time and the date which you can customise. It can also show images including ones from your phone and you can also use it as a viewfinder for the rear cameras which turned out to be very helpful. There's also an in-display fingerprint sensor but it isn't very consistent and we often had to try a few times before the phone unlocked.

Performance

The Mi 11 Ultra is powered by the Snapdragon 888 processor paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. Throughout our usage we didn't face any issues with the phone's performance. It was a smooth experience with no lags or app crashes. The software experience was also satisfactory especially with no ads. Our review unit runs Android 11-based MIUI 12.0.2. The phone can also run heavy games like Call of Duty: Mobile and Genshin Impact smoothly although it does tend to get hot after a while of gaming. The Mi 11 Ultra's dual speaker system with Harman Kardon is another highlight of the phone. It's great for watching videos playing games and also works as a Bluetooth speaker.

The phone packs a 5000mAh battery with support for up to 67W wired charging and 67W wireless turbo charging. Our review unit shipped with a 55W charging adapter which is still pretty fast as the phone charged to a 100% in around 70 minutes. When it comes to battery life the Mi 11 Ultra does an okay job of lasting a full day with daily usage involving streaming videos social media and occasional gaming.

Camera

On the Mi 11 Ultra you get a triple camera setup with a 50-megapixel wide-angle camera a 48-megapixel ultra wide angle camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera. Daylight shots turned out to be quite impressive. The colour reproduction was quite natural and the details were also intact. Even with zoomed in photos the details were there. The ultra wide angle camera boasts a field of view of 128 degrees which manages to capture a lot but this sometimes leads to loss of detail in some areas.

Focusing on subjects especially for close up shots was a little difficult as it took time to get the right focus. As for low-light photography it did manage to produce some decent shots with good enough clarity and colours. There's also an AI mode for some artificial adjustments to your photos.

The Mi 11 Ultra also offers some interesting camera features such as vlogging which has preset video effects that you can use to shoot videos in landscape mode. There's also a short video mode that's tailor-made for Instagram Reels with effects and background music.

Verdict

The Mi 11 Ultra delivers in almost all the key areas of a premium smartphone. We have hardly any complaints overall. However it does need a bit of work in some areas like the fingerprint sensor. It looks and feels very premium and it manages to give an all-round experience. Xiaomi does have the value-for-money tag still hanging over its head but the Mi 11 Ultra also proves why this device is worth that price. If you're looking to spend on a premium smartphone you can definitely consider the Mi 11 Ultra.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9tb2JpbGUvYXN1cy16ZW5mb25lLTgtdnMtemVuZm9uZS04LWZsaXAtd2hpY2gtb25lLWlzLWZvci15b3Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASUS Zenfone 8 vs Zenfone 8 Flip: Which one is for you?,"ASUS recently launched its Zenfone 8 Series flagship smartphones consisting of the Zenfone 8 and the Zenfone 8 Flip. Interestingly the Zenfone 8 16GB + 256GB and Zenfone 8 Flip 8GB + 256GB models that will arrive in the Philippines carry the same PHP 39995 price tag. So some of you might be wondering which device to get given the budget. We’ll try to answer that in this comparison.

Note: The specs listed below uses the configuration offered in the Philippine market.

Summary of advantages

ASUS Zenfone 8:

• More pixel-packed screen

• Higher refresh rate

• Gorilla Glass Victus

• Higher RAM capacity

• 3.5mm audio jack

• Hi-Res Audio

• FM Radio

• IP68 dust and water resistance

• Compact build

ASUS Zenfone 8 Flip:

• Larger screen

• Dedicated microSD card slot

• Telephoto camera

• Flip cameras allow for better selfies

• Larger battery

Display

Both devices sport Super AMOLED screens which means the screen has great contrast deep blacks and punchy colors. However while both have Full HD+ resolutions the amount of pixel you can cram per square inch differs because of the screen size. The Zenfone 8 has a smaller 5.9-inch screen with 446ppi while the Zenfone 8 Flip’s larger 6.67-inch screen gets 395ppi. As a result the former would look sharper when viewed up close but the latter is better for watching videos.

Another difference is in the refresh rate. The Zenfone 8 has 120Hz while the Zenfone 8 Flip has 90Hz which means the former will offer a smoother visual experience.

When it comes to screen protection both have Corning’s glass but the Zenfone 8 has the newer Victus which offers improved drop resistance compared to the Zenfone 8 Flip’s Gorilla Glass 6.

CPU and GPU

Both devices are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G SoC with an octa-core CPU and Adreno 660 GPU. This is a flagship SoC meaning it will be able to deliver both Zenfone’s features and handle whatever tasks you throw at it including gaming.

Memory

The Zenfone 8 in the Philippines comes in 8GB + 128GB and 16GB + 256GB configurations. The Zenfone 8 Flip on the other hand only comes in 8GB + 256GB.

If you’re after the largest storage possible you can go with either one. However the Zenfone 8 Flip offers a dedicated microSD card slot. However for the same price you’re getting a larger RAM on the Zenfone 8. Tricky I know.

Cameras

The Zenfone 8 sports two rear cameras and a single front camera. The Zenfone 8 Flip on the other hand only has a single triple-camera module that includes a telephoto lens. The latter has the advantage here as the motorized flip mechanism allows the user to ‘flip’ the cameras and use them for selfies. Meaning instead of just shooting selfies on a 12MP camera on the Zenfone 8 you’ll be using a 64MP main 12MP ultra-wide and 8MP telephoto (if needed).

Battery

The Zenfone 8 Flip obviously wins in terms of capacity for having a 5000mAh battery versus the 4000mAh on the Zenfone. Both also feature 30W fast charging. As for the battery life we’ll know once we’re done with our reviews so watch out for that.

Other features

The Zenfone 8 offers plenty of advantages over the Zenfone 8 Flip when it comes to other features. First there’s the 3.5mm audio jack with support for Hi-Res Audio FM Radio and IP68 dust and water resistance. Then there’s the lighter and more compact build which can be attributed to the smaller screen and battery capacity.

Which one to get?

So which one to get if you have PHP 39995 to burn? If you want a compact smartphone with a high refresh rate tougher glass protection bigger RAM 3.5mm audio jack support for Hi-Res Audio and IP68 certified get the Zenfone 8. If the budget is limited you can even go for the 8GB + 128GB model.

However if you’re the creator on the go who wants a device with a bigger screen larger battery support for a microSD card and more versatile cameras especially for selfies the Zenfone 8 Flip is the one to get.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vc3RvY2stcm9tLW9wcG8tYTNzLWZpcm13YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oppo A3S CPH1853 Flash File - Stock ROM Firmware,"Looking to Install a firmware flash file on Oppo A3S CPH1803EX? then you are at the right place.

At age 43 Tom Brady took the risky decision to leave the New England Patriots and join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His first season was a major success as he led the Buccaneers to the Super Bowl title. What made it more impressive that the Buccaneers beat the defending champions Kansas City Chiefs in the game. But how much more does Brady have left in him.

Former Super Bowl winner Chris Canty spoke recently on First Take about Tom Brady. He believes that if the Tampa Bay Buccaneers can keep Brady then he can win at least one more Super Bowl title. The franchise needs to do everything in their power to ensure that they get Brady what he wants and needs. But Brady is also focused and securing his legacy so that no player now or in the future can come close to matching his career achievements.

“If he plays two or three more seasons I’m going to see he has a really good chance to be able to get another ring at least. He’s got a really good chance at that. The organization is going to do whatever it takes whatever he wants. And with Tom Brady he’s also looking at it from a legacy standpoint. He wants to try and push it so far out that there’s not going be anybody that comes remotely close to being able to catch him.”

Brady is focused on winning the Super Bowl yet again this season. He and the Buccaneers have worked hard to ensure that the team continues to stay strong.

And while it's still incredibly hard to buy any graphics card right now without shelling out for a whole gaming PC there is still steep competition between these graphics cards.

Now more than ever the right graphics card for you between these two heavyweights is going to come down to what games you plan on playing what features you're looking for and more than anything – which one you can actually find in-stock long enough to actually buy.

But if you're not sure where to even start when looking at these excellent graphics cards we'll help you pick which is the right one for your needs.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT price

In the past making a price comparison between flagship graphics cards was pretty easy – just take a look at the MSRP and call it a day but that's not quite enough anymore. While we do know the MSRP for both graphics cards – $699 (£649 about AU$950) for the RTX 3080 and $649 (likely to be £649 AU$960) for the Radeon RX 6800 XT you'd be hard-pressed to find either graphics card for that price even if you are lucky enough to find it in stock.

Even in the Newegg Shuffle that's been going up on a nearly daily basis you'll find mostly third-party versions of the RTX 3080 and Radeon RX 6800 XT with highly inflated prices. For instance the MSI RTX 3080 Gaming X Trio is currently listed on Newegg for $1149. And even at that price it's totally sold out.

If you look at a website like StockX where scalpers hawk products for higher-than-street prices you can get a pretty good idea of how much these graphics cards actually cost right now.

Just looking at the reference designs for the graphics cards the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is way more expensive with the last sale going for $2600 at the time of writing. That's nearly a $2000 increase over the MSRP. The Radeon RX 6800 XT on the other hand is still expensive but it's not as expensive. Team Red's flagship is going for just $1809 but it looks like far fewer of them have been sold through the website.

We don't condone scalping but if you are desperate enough to buy a scalped graphics card right now the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT will give much better value for the money right now. Obviously that may change in the future.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT specs

Because the RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6800 XT are built on completely different architectures you can't really make an apples to apples comparison about graphics card specs. But we're going to try anyways.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 has 8704 CUDA cores which is what Nvidia calls its shading units spread across 68 streaming multiprocessors. This is paired with 10GB of GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit bus.

The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT has 4608 shading units across 72 compute units. That's paired with 16GB of VRAM on a 256-bit bus. So on paper it looks like the Radeon RX 6800 XT is much weaker.

However the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT has a much higher clock speed and has a unique Infinity Cache that helps to more efficiently move data from the VRAM to the actual GPU. That does help with bandwidth but it's not enough to make the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT keep up with the RTX 3080 100% of the time though it can hold its own.

You probably noticed the massive difference in VRAM too and that's definitely where the Radeon RX 6800 XT pulls way ahead of the Nvidia competition. We're not quite at a point where the 6800 XT's 16GB of VRAM is totally necessary but it should give some peace of mind when thinking about games coming in the future. Keep in mind though there's really no such thing as future proofing when it comes to gaming PCs so you shouldn't base too much of your decision on what will be good 5 years down the line.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT performance

While the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 has more theoretical raw power and the Radeon RX 6800 XT has theoretically faster memory bandwidth thanks to the Infinity Cache – not to mention more memory the two graphics cards trade places depending on the game you're looking at.

Just looking at the recently-released Resident Evil Village performance the Radeon RX 6800 XT is extremely competitive with the RTX 3080 even surpassing it at 1440p with ray tracing disabled. With ray tracing enabled however the RTX 3080 takes a very substantial lead even though this game doesn't support Nvidia's performance-boosting Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology.

That gap will widen quite a bit in games that do support DLSS though and you just have to look at Cyberpunk 2077 to see it. In that game the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 nearly doubles the performance of the Radeon RX 6800 XT before enabling DLSS at 1080p. And when you enable DLSS that performance lead skyrockets to nearly 4x the framerate.

So our advice would be to look at the games you know you're going to be playing the most and think about whether or not ray tracing is something you actually care about. If you do want to turn on that eye candy you're probably going to want to go with the RTX 3080 right now.

However in pure rasterization performance the two graphics cards are incredibly close still. And especially if you can find an AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT for half the price of what an RTX 3080 is going for that similar level of non-ray tracing performance is pretty appealing.

Nvidia RTX 3080 vs Radeon RX 6800 XT features

While gaming performance is likely going to be the biggest reason to buy one graphics card over another there are a ton of features that each of these graphics cards bring to the table that isn't just raw performance.

Nvidia has one of the most compelling features for our current moment where we're all working from home and it wasn't even originally pitched for that. Nvidia broadcast uses the Tensor cores in Nvidia's Ampere and Turing graphics cards to filter out background noise from your microphone and can even replace your background in a video call. So just by virtue of having an Nvidia graphics card in your PC you can get rid of a lot of distractions while telecommuting.

In contrast most of AMD's extra features still revolve primarily around gaming. One of the biggest and most recent of these is AMD Link. This will let you connect to your AMD-powered gaming PC remotely to play games or even run non-gaming programs through another PC or a smartphone. You can even let a friend link into your PC so you can play local co-op games with them even if you're anything but local.

There are plenty of features that boost performance too. Of course Nvidia has DLSS which uses AI to upscale games to give you much better performance without drastically impacting image quality. This only works in games where developers have actively implemented the technology though so you will want to make sure games support it.

AMD is working on something to compete with DLSS FidelityFX Super Resolution but it's not available yet – though it is expected sometime this year. AMD does have contrast-adaptive sharpening. CAS is basically a sharpening filter that will take colors of the scene into consideration so it doesn't look awful when running at a lower resolution. This is something that you can enable when you're say running a game at 1600p on a 4K monitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL21zaS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXRpLTEyLWdiLWFuZC1ydHgtMzA3MC10aS04Z2Itc3VwcmltLXNlcmllcy1ncHVzLWxlYWtlZC1sYW5kaW5nLWluLWp1bmUv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbXNpLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktMTItZ2ItYW5kLXJ0eC0zMDcwLXRpLThnYi1zdXByaW0tc2VyaWVzLWdwdXMtbGVha2VkLWxhbmRpbmctaW4tanVuZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB And RTX 3070 Ti 8GB ‘SUPRIM’ Series GPUs Leaked Landing In June?,"The GPU market is pretty much an imaginary unaffordable dream right now but Videocardz has recieved confirmation of even more Ampere based cards from NVIDIA. The brand new RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti series will be featured in the ""SUPRIM"" branding from MSI and include a VRAM upgrade. The RTX 3080 Ti will finally move users to a much needed 12 GB vRAM buffer (the 10 GB one on the RTX 3080 just doesn't cut it) while the RTX 3070 Ti will retain the 8GB memory buffer of the RTX 3070.

MSI RTX 3080 Ti SUPRIM and RTX 3070 SUPRIM get leaked by the paparazzi announcement in May and launching in June?

Videocardz has also leaked what appears to be the product information page of MSI's SUPRIM series and it should end the memory debate once and for all. The RTX 3080 Ti constitutes a signficiant upgrade over the RTX 3080 (it is basically a slighlty cut RTX 3090) at 10240 cores. The RTX 3070 Ti on the other hand offers a slight upgrade over the RTX 3070.

The NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti will be based on the GA104-400 GPU and hafve 6144 CUDA cores divided into 48 GPU clusters. This means it has exactly 2 more clusters than its non-Ti variant and 20 less than the RTX 3080. It will feature 48 RT cores (cor comparison the RTX 3080 has 68) which is also 2 more than the RTX 3070 and 20 less than the RTX 3080. ROPs will be 96 for this segment of NVIDIA's lineup and the clock speed is syet to be confirmed. It will feature a 256-bit memory bus with 8 GB or 16 GB GDDR6X memory clocked at 19 Gbps. It is currently scheduled for release in May 2021 alonside the RTX 3080 Ti but this could change considering the volatile supply situation.

Given below is the tweet confirming Videocard's exclusive details on the RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti:

You can use the memory ID given to trace the full specifications of the memory used:

Interestingly the RTX 3070 Ti is positioned as something of a replacement of the RTX 3070 because its not *that* powerful compared to its name sake. With just a difference of 2 GPU clusters theres only so much performance to be gained. The RTX 3080 Ti on the other hand rocks a massive difference when compared to its namesake.

The RTX 3080 Ti has 12 more GPU clusters compared to the RTX 3080 for a total of 10240 cores (2 less than the RTX 3090). It has 80 RT cores and 112 ROPs. It will be coupled with a 12 GB GDDR6X vRAM buffer and a 384-bit bus for a total of 912 GB/s. It is clearly a monster of a card and from the specifications it appears to be a very slightly less-powerful replacement of the RTX 3090 and the true flagship of NVIDIA's ampere lineup.

According to videocards the graphic cards are currently expected to be announced on May 29 with a launch expected in the first two weeks of June. It would also be very interesting to see how much NVIDIA cripples mining performance on these cards. If they manage to cripple it to a large enough extent we might just see these cards available for close to MSRP from AIB and retail partners although I wouldn't hold my brath about",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydXN0ZWRyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2N0cmxhbHRkZWxldGUtd2h5LXRoZS1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNTAtbGFwdG9wcy1hcmVudC1qdXN0LWZvci1nYW1lcnMtNDEzODA2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ctrl+Alt+Delete: Why the Nvidia RTX 3050 laptops aren't just for gamers,"Nvidia announced the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPUs this week but while they will no doubt please budget-minded gamers they’ve also got the potential to take on the MacBook Pro for content creation.

Nvidia’s GPUs aren’t just for gaming. That’s thanks to the free-of-charge Nvidia Studio drivers which can optimise the RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti GPUs for content creation instead of gaming. In Nvidia’s own words “Nvidia Studio Drivers provide artists creators and 3D developers the best performance and reliability when working with creative applications.”

While these drivers work across many Nvidia GPUs they look particularly well matched with the new RTX 3050 and RTX 3050 Ti mobile GPUs. Various laptops brands clearly agree with me with non-gaming laptops such as the Dell XPS 15 and Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Pro embracing the RTX 3050 mobile GPU.

But how good are the RTX 3050 GPUs compared to existing options such as those found inside the MacBook Pro? It’s too early for me to do my own testing but Nvidia has provided its own benchmarks. Take these results with a pinch of salt for now but it’s still interesting to have a look.

Nvidia claims a laptop with an RTX 3050 Ti will see 3.1x faster speeds than a laptop relying on integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. That apparently translates into significantly shorter export speeds on Adobe Premiere Pro falling from a 60 minutes down to an outstanding 20 minutes. And compared to the MacBook Pro with a Radeon Pro 5600M GPU the RTX 3050 Ti is supposedly quicker by an 8-minute margin.

Nvidia also suggests the RTX 3050 Ti can render a heavy scene on Blender in just 26 minutes which is very quick compared to the MacBook Pro (Radeon Pro 5600M) which takes a whopping 1 hour and 17 minutes.

So if Nvidia’s benchmark results are accurate there’s no doubt that the RTX 3050 GPUs provide superior performance compared to the most powerful 16-inch MacBook Pro and Intel’s Iris Xe graphics. But that’s not very useful without knowing the price points.

Fortunately the most enticing aspect of the RTX 3050 GPUs is that they don’t cost a lot of money for manufacturers to fit inside laptops. The Dell XPS 15 with an RTX 3050 Ti will reportedly cost $1249.99. That’s hardly cheap but consider the cheapest 16-inch MacBook Pro costs a whopping $2399.00 and the Dell suddenly looks an absolute bargain.

Of course the upcoming MacBook Pro 2021 will likely leapfrog the performance provided by the RTX 3050 by a considerable margin but Apple’s laptop is also expected to cost a pretty sum. If you want to keep costs down to a minimum but still want to edit video and animate on the go it’s definitely worth checking out these new RTX 3050 laptops.

But thanks to competition in the field it’s not expected to make a big splash sale-wise.

Now though Evkeeza boasts data that could help it garner bigger approval in severe hypertriglyceridemia—provided it can find the right patients to target.

In a phase 2 study presented Sunday at the American College of Cardiology’s annual scientific session Evkeeza helped reduce patients’ triglyceride levels by 57% at median after 12 weeks compared with an overall increase of 1.8% for patients taking placebo.

But the drug worked far better in patients with certain genetic characteristics and essentially didn’t work at all in others suggesting that doctors could test patients to identify who's likely to respond before starting treatment researchers said.

“One of the very important findings in this trial is that by genotyping patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia” doctors are able to identify people who will respond “very well” to the medicine lead author Robert Rosenson M.D. said in an interview. Rosenson is a professor of medicine in cardiology and the director of metabolism and lipids at the Mount Sinai Health System

Investigators recruited 51 patients in North America and Europe with triglyceride levels of 500 mg/dL or higher despite maintaining a strict diet. The patients also had a prior hospitalization for acute pancreatitis a common complication of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Two-thirds of patients received the Regeneron drug for 24 weeks while one-third received a placebo for the first 12 weeks and then Evkeeza for the second 12 weeks.

For patients with a double copy of certain mutations in LPL pathway genes trial investigators found “essentially no benefit” from the treatment. Among those with a single mutation in LPL pathway genes—or no mutations—investigators recorded triglyceride reductions of around 80%.

Evkeeza also known as evinacumab scored an FDA approval in February to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia an ultra-rare disease that affects about 1300 people in the U.S. In that indication the medicine bears a list price of $450000 a year and it’s going up against Amgen’s PCSK9 drug Repatha a mass market med carrying a much lower price.

Plus Regeneron’s own PCSK9 drug Praluent scored an FDA approval in that use back in April. And Novartis is running studies of its PCSK9 inhibitor inclisiran in familial hypercholesterolemia.

Evkeeza works differently however; it binds to the angiopoietin-like protein 3 which regulates cholesterol and triglycerides. Evercore ISI analysts have projected the drug can reach peak sales of $200 million to $400 million.

It isn't clear how Regeneron would price the drug in severe hypertriglyceridemia which affects millions of Americans rather than the 1300 who have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia according to one study. Regeneron hasn't yet said whether it plans to take Evkeeza into phase 3 testing for hypertriglyceridemia.

Up ahead are potential Evkeeza studies at a higher dose and in patients with elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.

Current treatment options for severe hypertriglyceridemia include fibrates omega-3 fatty acids and insulin. Patients with the disease “suffer immensely” and face high risks of hospitalizations for pancreatitis Rosenson said. They often respond “inadequately” to existing medicines he added.

“Each and every effort that we can make to prevent recurrent pancreatitis is important for the quality of life and survival for these patients” he said.

Board members approved the appointment of Charles Edwards East assistant principal to director of title services.

Edwards will fill an “extremely important position” said Superintendent Jim Roberts.

The school corporation’s Title 1 Program provides services and resources to eligible students educators and families to help foster “educational excellence.”

Title 1 is a federal education program that provides financial assistance to schools with high percentages of low-income families to help ensure that all students meet academic benchmarks.

Gina Pleak the previous title services director is moving into the role of assistant superintendent of human resources. The latter position which is also part of the school cabinet was previously held by Teresa Heiny who is retiring.

During the meeting board members commended retirees including Heiny for their service.

“Thank you Ms. Heiny for all the work you’ve done over the years” said Board Member Julie Bilz. “We really appreciate it.”

In addition school officials also welcomed Edwards to the title services position.

“With all the work that we have to do we’re doing a lot of strategic planning work” Roberts said. “… When we look at the future and we’re doing the moonshot stuff and we say ‘Alright here’s our moonshot.’ Well 10 years from now we land on the moon and then we have a ‘remember when’ moment. We look back. And I’m thinking the ‘remember when’ may have been the night we hired Charles.”

Edwards said that he’s excited about his new role and how it will enable him to work with many programs that need funding “to be able to do great things for kids.”

“It’s just one of those opportunities that I couldn’t pass up” he said.

The actor took to his Instagram handle and shared the news along with photos and videos of the donations.

In the caption he wrote “We at #ProjectHealIndia & #AnupamKherFoundation were humbled to make a small contribution of 5 Resmed #Bipap machines and 5 #OxygenConcentrators to @my_bmc for their selfless #CoronaWarriors!! @anupamkherfoundation @AshTewariMD @BharatForgeLtd #DoingOurBit #StayStrongIndia.”

The present situation of India battling the pandemic is a major concern as help is being extended from the entire world for our nation. Mumbai too is facing this crisis with good Samaritans helping in any way they can and NGOs trying their best to get medical aid for people who need it.

Anupam Kher Foundation in collaboration with Dr Ashutosh Tewari (Global Cancer Foundation USA) and Baba Kalyani (Bharat Forge India) recently started an initiative called ‘Project Heal India’.

Through the project the organisation aims to provide critical lifesaving equipment and other life-supporting devices to medical institutions and hospitals across India. The agenda of the organisation is to ensure that help is provided wherever needed and with prompt action.

‘Project Heal India’ has initiated various donations to different medical institutions of the country under its first leg of operations and aims at reaching out to more institutions for further support.

The second wave of coronavirus has infected many people and the number of COVID-19 positive cases has been rapidly rising. In Bollywood also an array of celebrities like Kangana Ranaut Aamir Khan Vicky Kaushal among others got infected within a span of a few weeks.

With a total of 326098 new COVID-19 cases being recorded in the last 24 hours the cumulative count of cases in the country reached 24372907 informed the Union Health Ministry. After 3890 deaths in the last 24 hours the toll due to the disease has gone up to 266207. There are currently 3673802 active cases in the country.

Meanwhile on the work front Anupam had won the Best Actor award at the New York City International Film Festival for his short film titled ‘Happy Birthday’ adding a feather to his cap. The film also bagged the Best Short Film award at the prestigious film festival.

‘Happy Birthday’ marked Anupam and Aahana Kumra’s second collaboration after featuring in the 2019 critically acclaimed movie ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’.

Robert Lewandowski equaled the Bundesliga record of 40 goals in a season during Bayern Munich’s 2-2 draw against SC Freiburg.

His first-half penalty drew him level with Gerd Müller’s tally set in the 1971/72 season and the striker paid tribute to Müller by revealing a shirt that read “4EVER GERD” as he celebrated the goal.

⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽ — FC Bayern Munich (@FCBayernEN) May 15 2021

Bayern wrapped up a ninth consecutive league title last week and is now 11 points clear at the top of the table.

“I’m so unbelievably proud to make history for FC Bayern and to play a part in creating the stories that fans will tell their children – following in the footsteps of legends like Gerd Müller” Lewandowski wrote on Twitter after the match.

He reached the 40-goal landmark when he converted a penalty after Thomas Müller was fouled at a corner – a goal that also saw Bayern become the first side to score in 34 consecutive away games in the Bundesliga.

The away side’s lead was short-lived however as Manuel Gulde equalized three minutes later when he headed in from a corner.

Serge Gnabry had a goal ruled out for offside at the start of the second half but Leroy Sane restored Bayern’s lead shortly afterward when he converted Müller’s cross.

Bayern looked to be on course for victory but Christian Günter’s goal 10 minutes from full-time leveled the scores.

Lewandowski had several second-half chances to score a record-breaking 41st league goal of the season but was denied by goalkeeper Mark Flekken. He could still beat Müller’s record next week when Bayern faces Augsburg in its final game of the season on May 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLzU1MzYwMC1uZWFybHktaGFsZi1vZi1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZG9udC10cnVzdC1jZGMtYW5kLWZkYS10aGF0cy1hLXByb2JsZW0v0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvNTUzNjAwLW5lYXJseS1oYWxmLW9mLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1kb250LXRydXN0LWNkYy1hbmQtZmRhLXRoYXRzLWEtcHJvYmxlbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly half of Americans don’t trust CDC and FDA — that’s a problem,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/553600-nearly-half-of-americans-dont-trust-cdc-and-fda-thats-a-problem/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLzU1MzYwMC1uZWFybHktaGFsZi1vZi1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZG9udC10cnVzdC1jZGMtYW5kLWZkYS10aGF0cy1hLXByb2JsZW0v0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvNTUzNjAwLW5lYXJseS1oYWxmLW9mLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1kb250LXRydXN0LWNkYy1hbmQtZmRhLXRoYXRzLWEtcHJvYmxlbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL2Zvb3RiYWxsL2J1bmRlc2xpZ2EvMjAyMC0yMDIxL2Zvb3RiYWxsLW5ld3Mtcm9iZXJ0LWxld2FuZG93c2tpLWVxdWFscy1nZXJkLW11bGxlci1zLTQwLWdvYWwtcmVjb3JkLWFnYWluc3Qtc2MtZnJlaWJ1cmdfc3RvODMyMDc2MS9zdG9yeS5zaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Lewandowski equals Gerd Muller's 40-goal record with strike against SC Freiburg,"Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has equalled Gerd Muller's 40-goal Bundesliga record with a goal against SC Freiburg.

Bayern are already 10 points ahead of second-placed RB Leipzig and have secured the German league title.

They visited ninth-placed Freiburg on Saturday with Lewandowski on 39 goals in the league already but the 32-year-old Polish striker scored from the spot on 26 minutes.

The Poland striker is already second on the all-time scorers list in the Bundesliga with 276 goals now behind only Mueller's 365. Mueller set his record in the 1971/72 season.

Lewandowski missed a chance in front of goal in the 78th minute and also had an 83rd minute header saved by the keeper after Christian Guenter had drawn the hosts level.

But the result will matter little on the day as Lewandowski was showered with praise with the German Football League (DFL) hailing it as an ""historic"" achievement.

""Almost half a century after the unique Gerd Mueller set the record Robert Lewandowski equalled it today"" the DFL said. ""Congratulations for this outstanding and historic performance.""

Bayern play Augsburg in their final game of the season next week."

The SolarWinds presentation at the ARC 2021 Industry Forum shows why industrial companies need strategies to deal with the growing risks of software supply chain attacks. Industrial cybersecurity is a never-ending whack-a-mole game. Attackers find new ways to penetrate systems and defenders respond with new defensive measures. More sophisticated defenses drive more sophisticated surreptitious attacks.

The SolarWinds attack demonstrates how far this game has progressed and how high the bar has been raised for an effective cybersecurity program. Software supply chain attacks exploit trust relationships with suppliers and extend the cyber battlefield beyond the province of individual companies. Defense against these kinds of attacks requires a collaborative effort among many different security teams.

Eric Byres the CEO of aDolus and a well-known figure in OT cybersecurity provided an informative presentation about the SolarWinds attack at the 2021 ARC Industry Forum. His talk demonstrated how a compromised update file affected 1800 companies that use the popular SolarWinds Orion network management software. This resulted in persistent unfettered access to confidential information of Fortune 500 companies telcos the defense and intelligence community and even the White House. While there were no reports of OT systems being compromised all defenders should take note.

Lesson 1 – Attackers Can Outsmart Even the Best Defenders

SolarWinds was an extremely sophisticated attack generally attributed to Russia. Regardless of who actually launched the attack the resources required to execute it certainly suggests the involvement of a nation state.

Most reports on this attack refer to a single malware package called Sunburst. But the actual attack involved a fifteen-month sequence of attacker actions leveraging a collection of different malware and web shell components including Sunspot Sunburst Teardrop Cobalt Strike Beacon and SuperNova that attackers used to progress their goals. These tools were so well designed that attackers were able to compromise some of the world’s most critical and well-protected IT systems.

Lesson 2 – Supply Chain Attacks Amplify ROI

Cyber criminals and nation-states strive to maximize the returns generated from their malicious cyber efforts. This fuels continuous development of more surreptitious ways to overcome defenses and more sophisticated malware to lengthen time before detection.

The SolarWinds attack demonstrates how supply chains amplify the effectiveness of both strategies. By exploiting supply chain trust relationships an attack on one site gave the actors access to information in over 1800 major companies and government agencies. While the effort to build and assemble the malware was extensive this investment was repaid manifold with over seven months of unfettered access to droves of information and the opportunity to hide their tracks.

The Odyssey of the Seas is the latest addition to the company's fleet and was set to debut in Haifa. Israeli residents age 18 and up all fully vaccinated against COVID-19 would have been able to embark on 3- to 7-night getaway throughout the eastern Mediterranean.

The decision at the time to start the ship's first voyages from Israel followed the country's widely successful vaccination rollout which has seen a vast majority of Israelis being vaccinated against COVID-19.

However this has all changed due to the ongoing situation in Israel.

""Due to the unrest in Israel and the region Odyssey has not been able to complete the preparations required to operate from Haifa as planned"" the cruise line said in a release provided by spokesperson Lyan Sierra-Caro according to USA Today.

“This change while understandably very disappointing for the Israeli holidaymakers who we looked forward to welcoming on board reflects our strong commitment to offering holidays that are as safe as they are memorable” Royal Caribbean International president and CEO Michael Bayley said in a statement according to USA Today.

The ongoing crisis in Israel was sparked after ongoing clashes in Jerusalem specifically in Sheikh Jarrah and al-Aqsa on the Temple Mount as well as an ongoing escalation between the IDF and the Gaza-based terrorist group Hamas.

'Due to the unrest in Israel and the region Odyssey has not been able to complete the preparations required to operate from Haifa Israel as planned. Given this and the uncertainty of when things will return to normal the industry’s newest ship will now spend its inaugural season in Florida' Royal Caribbean said in a statement.

The company said its change of plans was driven by the safety and well-being of guests crew and the surrounding communities. Details on Odyssey’s new cruises will be announced at a future date.

This second Quantum Ultra ship delivered March 31 had been scheduled begin its inaugural North American season in November offering six- to eight-night itineraries from Port Everglades to destinations including Perfect Day at CocoCay Curaçao and Aruba.

Hopes to return

Royal Caribbean said it will continue to closely monitor the changing situation in Israel and remains hopeful to return with its ships in the future. Travel partners and passengers on the affected sailings are being notified and getting information to confirm the refund process.

This would have been Royal Caribbean's second ship to return to service following Quantum of the Seas' resumption from Singapore in December. As earlier reported here a coronavirus spike in Singapore is temporarily reducing Quantum's capacity to 25% and impacting on-board services.

Other cruise lines also have Israel calls

Situated in the heart of the vibrant Strijp-S district the design was created in collaboration with the Trudo housing association. Titled “The Tribune” the architecture boasts a stepped tribune-like structure offering residents and visitors access and views onto the public square below.

Originally built as a component of the Philips electronics company’s factory complex Strijp-S has transformed since Philips’ departure in the 1990s into the center of Eindhoven’s culture. Now a hub of activities it hosts Dutch Design Week and a mix of creative businesses and residents living in renovated factories and contemporary high-rises surrounding the area.

Reflecting the area’s industrial past The Tribune climbs eight stories then falls to a low two stories at Ketelhuislein blending in with the surrounding greenery. The two-story design alongside the plaza of the Ketelhuisplien forms a mediating element between the open space and the Tribune’s high rise. It boasts a timber facade adding warmth and echoes the activations exhibited during Dutch Design Week such as 2019’s famous Biobasecamp.

Without a doubt Strijp-S is a neighborhood with extraordinary charisma. With our design we aim to capture and contribute to the emergent energy of this place creating a new building that fits seamlessly in its place while lifting the atmosphere of Strijp-S to the next level. The many features that promote a dynamic and tight-knit residential community in the building are a big part of that. --MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas.

In an effort to embrace sustainability The Tribune’s steps are generously planted with greenery with a number of trees and long planters that serve as railings. The Tribune also boasts expansive private green terraces that feature biodiversity and mitigate water runoff. These oases offer private spaces for residents and communal gathering spots interconnected by staircases fostering a sense of community. Extending toward Leidingstraat the design features a pier that doubles as a public lookout enhancing connectivity and safety.

Internally the building hosts commercial spaces on the lower two stories that can be used as retail stores restaurants cafes or offices. Above the apartments are accessed with wide internal hallways boasting natural daylight. In fact the design creates a sense of gathering within hallways serving as community spaces and fostering neighborly relationships like a small street.

The state’s main teachers union spent $2.85 million during the first quarter of this year — more than twice as much as the second and third ranking lobbying funders two Big Oil interests — as it pushed teachers to the front of the line for vaccines and resisted efforts to force a return to the classroom.

The review also shows the resiliency of the lobbying industry: Groups spent $368.5 million over the year since the pandemic emerged to make their views known under the Sacramento Capitol Rotunda down only slightly from the previous year despite health precautions that shifted many legislative functions online.

Their pursuit of political influence comes at a critical juncture amid an enduring pandemic a national economic crisis potential electoral shake-ups — including an election to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom and the 2022 midterms — and a $76 billion state budget surplus.

To illustrate special interests’ role in these critical issues the Bay Area News Group conducted its analysis of state lobbying expenditures by downloading and refining raw data from the California Secretary of State’s Cal-Access website. California law requires interest groups to disclose quarterly what they spend to drive the legislative process.

“We’ve never seen a crisis of this proportion with coffers this large” said David McCuan a Sonoma State University Professor of Political Science. Like all money in the political realm lobbying expenditures are a form of sophisticated communication he said made even more complicated by the way that COVID-19 has restricted access in Sacramento. “If you want to know what a politician believes or an organization believes you look at where they put their money.”

The CTA is no newcomer to this scene. The 300000-member Burlingame-based organization ranks third in total lobbying spending since 2017 spending $18 million a figure exceeded only by Western States Petroleum and Chevron which spent $30 million and $27 million respectively. Still the union’s current activity is remarkable — it is on track to blow past the $4 million it spent on lobbying in 2020 funding television and digital advertisements advocating to continue online classes for more than six million school children and obtain vaccines for one of the state’s largest workforces. The teachers union also topped the list of interests during the second quarter of last year in the pandemic’s first months.

“We’re very grateful that the governor set aside vaccines for teachers and that was one of the outcomes” of our lobbying said Lisa Gardiner a union spokesperson.

“When it comes to safe reopening there have been challenges and complexities around safe instruction for schools” said Gardiner. “We needed personal protective equipment safe ventilation vaccines small cohorts of students and lobbying is education. I used to work in the capital that’s what advocacy is its educating people about perspectives and situations…We feel we have a social responsibility to do that.”

California is among the last states to reopen campuses drawing criticism from some parents groups who claim the state deferred to the deep-pocketed teachers union at the expense of students who continue to slog through online classes from their homes. School closures continue in the Golden State despite growing scientific evidence that they could safely reopen.

The BANG analysis found that the biggest spender on lobbying since early 2020 had nothing to do with the pandemic. Big Tobacco specifically North Carolina-based RAI Services Company poured more than $8.7 million last year into its failed effort to defeat SB 793 a new law that bans the sale of flavored tobacco products in California. Its spending dropped off thereafter.

But since 2021 began the legislature’s focus — and that of the special interests — has sharpened. With California unexpectedly awash in revenues other advocates for public sector employees have joined the teachers group as top spenders on lobbying. The California State Council of Service Employees an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union spent $889000 the County Behavioral Health Directors Association spent $632000 and the California School Employees Association spent about $185000 in the first quarter.



Counties and cities are also spending large amounts of money on lobbyists to secure a portion of state funds with Contra Costa County reporting $725000 in the first quarter more than all other government agencies.

Contra Costa County’s Senior Deputy Administrator Lara Delaney who supervises lobbying contracts and legislative efforts acknowledged “unusually high” expenditures but said the bulk of the money $656989 paid for professional association dues particularly for health and welfare professional organizations.

Alameda County came in second with $487000 and Los Angeles County the state’s largest and most populous spent $412000.

McCuan noted that the pandemic has shifted critical responses for testing vaccine distribution and overall increased healthcare and other government responsibilities onto local jurisdictions which have increased lobbying activities in an effort to recoup some of the additional costs associated with COVID-19 mitigation.

“Many governments have had to dip into reserves to pay for response and that requires relief from Sacramento for governments to remain solvent so they’ve picked up their game in Sacramento” McCuan said.



After years of droughts wildfires and threatened electrical shortages public utilities are also high on the list of top spenders in the first quarter of 2021: Pacific Gas and Electric spent $636000 Sempra Energy spent $475000 and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California spent $458000.



While some groups appear to have tapered off lobbying efforts during the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year — the Western States Petroleum Association halved its annual spending in 2020 and Equality California the civil rights organization spent nearly $1.7 million in 2019 and only $205000 in 2020 — many other groups seem to have continued lobbying unabated.



The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association ramped up spending last quarter reporting more than $946000 in lobbying expenditures or about half of its annual expenditures since 2017. The tax relief advocates were the fourth leading spender in the first quarter.

Scott Kaufman a lobbyist for the 250000-member organization said one of the major issues the association pursued in the state capital was legislation to protect property tax advantages for certain kinds of homeownership transfers between parents and children which were nullified when voters passed Proposition 19.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 979 that requires public companies headquartered in California to diversify their governing boards with directors from underrepresented communities by the end of 2021.

With four new board members in tow — two women and two Black men — the Manhattan Beach-based electric vehicle-maker was already compliant with the new law.



The newcomers were Wendy Greuel former Los Angeles City Controller; Roderick Randall a co-founder of Boston-based Vesbridge Partners; Nadine Watt chairwoman of the Los Angeles Business Council; and Mark Hickson an executive vice president of corporate development strategy quality and integration at Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc.



The automaker has since added William McDermott chief executive of ServiceNow Inc. a software company based in Santa Clara and Mitch Zuklie chief executive of San Francisco-based law firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. The eight-member board also includes company’s two co-founders Chief Executive Henrik Fisker and his wife Chief Financial Officer Geeta Gupta-Fisker.



“We have a phenomenal board” said Randall who’s also an early investor in the automaker. “At any time they all bring different perspectives so when we have a discussion you get all these different backgrounds and angles and thought processes. I’m just delighted to be a part of the group and to be honest with you I pinch myself half the time.”



Other local companies are following suit adding to their boards individuals who self-identify as Black African American Hispanic Latino Asian Pacific Islander Native American Native Hawaiian Alaska Native or as members of the LGBTQ community.





Board additions



Playa Vista-based Honest Co. Inc. which in May raised $413 million in an initial public offering for a market value of about $1.45 billion last month added James White and Susan Gentile to its board of directors.



White is the former president and chief executive of Atlanta-based Jamba Inc. while Gentile serves as chief financial and administrative officer at H.I.G. Capital Management in Miami.



“James and Susan’s diverse expertise are a welcome addition to our board of directors” Honest Co. co-founder and Chief Creative Officer Jessica Alba said in a statement.



“As our company continues to expand our reach across categories in the clean space the background they will bring to Honest will help ensure we continue to reflect the needs and wants of our consumers and the communities we serve in all that we do” Alba added.



Santa Monica-based Counter Brands which sold a majority stake to Carlyle Group Inc. last month in a deal that valued it at $1 billion in January added Dasha Smith to its board of directors its fifth female member. Smith is chief administrative officer for the National Football League.



Santa Monica-based internet services company Leaf Group Ltd. which is set to be acquired by Virginia-based media conglomerate Graham Holdings Co. in a deal valued at $323 million appointed Harold Logan to its board in November. Logan a Harvard University graduate served as chief executive at BuyBook Technologies Inc. prior to its acquisition by AutoTrader Inc. in 2014.



LiveXLive Media Inc. a West Hollywood-based company that specializes in streaming live events and original shows announced on May 3 that Kris Wright vice president of Nike Inc.’s global men’s footwear lifestyle product will join its board of directors. Wright is also an appointed member of the Executive Leadership Council a national organization of Black CEOs.

I hear screams (of anger as well as joy),"Yes green. There's a purple one too. And oh a white keyboard. Jon Prosser render

I've been thinking about this for a while.

What would it be like to have a laptop that didn't look like my last laptop or the one before that?

If you're a committed MacBook Air user -- guilty m'lud -- you know should you have the remnants of a heart and a soul -- that Apple has made you feel like the person who always goes to church on Sundays never sings and is always generous when the collection plate comes by.

The pandemic seemed to incite a tinge of guilt in Apple. It suddenly released an Air with the company's new M1 chip.

The problem of course is that the M1Air looked exactly like the IntelAir. Which felt like a little ConAir.

Yet now there is hope for all aesthetes. Well some aesthetes. Well it really depends on your sense of taste.

Prodigious leak-magnet Jon Prosser claims to have been passed some images of an upcoming M2Air. He asked a renderer to portray what these future Airs might look like three-dimensionally.

And oh do breathe.

It seems that the new Air will allegedly have coats of many colors. Green for example. And even something that resembles purple.

Colors. It's almost as if it's a homage to the fact that we're emerging from a bleak period into a rainbow-adorned future.

Moreover the prospect of matching -- or contrasting -- the color of your new Air with your new blazingly colorful iMac will have the dedicated rushing to Sherwin Williams or Home Depot for advice.

I admit I'm unreasonably uplifted by the idea of my next MacBook Air not exuding the same silvery gray chilly dullness.

There's more. The Air will -- must I add more allegedlys? -- also be thinner than your average horse racing trainer's excuses. I'm not sure how moved I am by this as I've almost cut myself on my current Air's edges more than once.

ZDNET Recommends The best laptops Our recommended models for every use case and platform. Read now

Still the new Air will supposedly not be tapered. Tapered pants are out ergo so are tapered MacBooks. And a small thing this but the function keys suddenly look bigger. Which will certainly please those who bother to use them.

Yes I've been avoiding the other stuff. The stuff's that sure to divide at least as much as it conquers. For this leak suggests that not only will the new Air have the same white bezels as the new iMac but oh the keyboard will be white too.

I imagine should this leak even verge on the accurate that Apple will claim the keyboard is a proprietary new color called Snow White. Or Tighty Whitey.

I worry though that white keyboards may appear more joyous but ultimately look a touch cheap when compared with the current soothing black.

Should you constantly hark back to former centuries when every Mac was a glorious adventure perhaps you'll be ululating for joy.

I fear though that there'll be those whose timbers shiver at the sight of this almost frivolous attempt at happy design.

You never know it might not happen.",,,,,,

The Piper Point property’s value is largely because it has 131 feet of frontage on unusually deep water according to the Los Angeles Times. That means it can accommodate large yachts.

The property has two docks and four moorings for that purpose making it one of the area’s largest privately owned marina facilities attached to a home according to Forbes Global Properties.

For that it appears Murdoch paid the full asking price for the roughly half-acre property.

The house is an entirely renovated two-story boat shed with a living area on the top floor and a luxury take on a workshop below possibly for working on boats.

The living area has two bedrooms and a modest common space under vaulted ceilings. The lower level leads to a small lawn and swimming pool.

Its Murdoch’s biggest real estate deal since he bought L.A.’s Chartwell Estate for $150 million in late 2019. Earlier that year his father sold 21st Century Fox Inc. to Walt Disney Co. for $12 million which was distributed to the younger Murdoch and his siblings.

Lachlan Murdoch has been working at the upper echelons of his father’s companies since 2014 following a roughly 10-year hiatus. He is widely seen as his father’s successor to run those companies and was named Chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation shortly after the Disney deal.

Game of the Week

Resident Evil Village

Platform: Xbox PlayStation Google Stadia PC

Genre: Horror

Price: £54.99

Age rating: 18+

Resident Evil is a hallmark for survival horror games and Village is a jumpy fast-paced adrenaline-driven follow-up to 2017’s Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. It continues on with Ethan Winters who finds himself in a disturbing village brimming with mutant creatures – not least of all the now-infamous towering vampire Lady Dimitrescu – as he tries to find his baby daughter. There are even some familiar faces in the form of Chris Redfield. It’s very much in line with previous Resident Evil games blasting your way through villains you encounter but that’s fine. Some of the boss fights are a bit lacklustre but that doesn’t detract from the overall horrific beauty of the Village especially on a next-gen console.

Skip to the end: A fitting continuation for Biohazard with all the things we love to be scared of.

Score: 8/10

New Pokemon Snap

Platform: Switch

Genre: Simulation

Price: £49.99

Age rating: 3+

Fancy yourself as a photographer? New Pokemon Snap is a more relaxed type of gaming with photographing Pokemon in the wild for your Photodex as the main mission. As the name suggests this is not the first time we’ve had a Snap-based Pokemon title; we were first introduced to it on the Nintendo 64. You find yourself in the Lental region and get ratings from Professor Mirror on your shots based on factors like capturing two Pokemon in the same image – we felt some of our snaps deserved higher scores but maybe Professor Mirror has tough standards. You can also share your pictures online and apply special effects to them. It can all get a little repetitive after a while though due to a lack of rewards pushing us to snap on.

Skip to the end: A chilled gaming moment that hits the right nostalgic tone but almost a bit too slow to keep us hooked.

Score: 7/10

Hood: Outlaws & Legends

Platform: Xbox PlayStation PC

Genre: Multiplayer

Price: £24.99

Age rating: 18+

This Robin Hood-inspired multiplayer-only heist title is officially classed as PvPvE – yes rather clunky. By that we mean player vs player vs environment. And by that we mean two teams of four players battle it out to steal treasure from an oppressive rich regime so you not only have a live rival gang to worry about but the AI baddies too. You need to find the sheriff to get the key then locate the vault and get away safely. All the while the rival team could ambush you at any moment as they want exactly the same thing. It is a good premise but when you do win there is no real sense of progression making you long to play much more. Enjoyment is kind of dependent on your company.

Skip to the end: Despite a well-designed art style and interesting concept lack of longevity pulls Hood: Outlaws & Legends down slightly.

Score: 7/10

Simon’s Cat – Story Time

Platform: iOS

Genre: Puzzle

All three have been mainstays across the whole season in Steven Gerrard’s line-up and have earned the right to celebrate.

The Light Blues have had the league wrapped up since early March but had to wait to today to get their hands on the trophy.

That sparked wild celebrations outside Ibrox inside George Square and across many other Glasgow locations.

And Kent’s post – racking up an impressive 25000 likes – gives a glimpse into the party INSIDE the stadium too.

He captioned the post: “Montecristo Way Winners Circle.

“Champions 55.

“WE ARE THE PEOPLE.”

Ex-Gers stopper Wes Foderringham commented on the pic saying: “Ayyy.”

He was joined by hundreds of others who loved the picture of the three stars.

One user commented: “Love you Kenty.”

Another added: “Please never leave.”

A third said: “Glasgow is blue.”

A fellow fan wrote: “I love that from you Kenty my man.”

While one said: “Fantastic lads. Thank you.”

Meanwhile Scott Brown signed off at Celtic with a dig at Rangers by saying: I'm a PROPER Invincible.

The Ibrox side's unbeaten Premiership campaign ended the Hoops captain's ten-in-a-row dream.

He said: ""It's obviously a sad time but let's be honest I've had a fantastic 14 years at Celtic.

""I would rather be in my situation than anyone else's with 620 games and 22 trophies.

""We have gone proper Invincible throughout the entire season.

""We have gone Treble after Treble after Treble after Treble - and that's not easy.

""I will reflect over the summer and I will smile about it all because it's been fantastic.

""There have been so many highs it's been one thing after the other especially over the last four years.

""It does take its toll on everyone's body and that is what happened this year. We gave it everything we could but we just couldn't get the ten.

""You do have to think about this season too - as it's a learning curve.”

While Buddy is cuteness overloaded as a few commented ""adorable"" and ""too cute for buddie"" others were more interested with the chair in the background.

The chair also looks super comfy as many made the same comments.

""Do you sell this chair?"" asked one.

But that's kind of the point of his Southern Plains Productions.

""I've always wanted to start a theater company. I've known from a very young age that the theater is my calling and it's what I want to do with my life"" Gifford said.

""In Oklahoma we already have a really vibrant arts scene. ... but there really is nothing like this. There's not a place where collegiate and early-career artists can come together and share their unique vision into creating one story.""

Southern Plains Productions will present its inaugural production ""Small Mouth Sounds” directed by fellow Oklahoma native and Carnegie Mellon University directing student Jacob Musgrove at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday on the Myriad Botanical Gardens' Water Stage.

""This is a story that needs to be told right now. It's about six lost souls ... and throughout this journey it's very awkward because you're not supposed to talk. But sometimes words come out inherently or your actions speak louder than words"" Gifford said.

What is the show about?

A critically acclaimed play by Drama Desk Award winner Bess Wohl ""Small Mouth Sounds"" follows six people from different walks of life who converge in the woods for a silent-meditation retreat. When forced to confront themselves their pasts and each other their vows of silence conflict with the innate human need for connection.

""I think it's really interesting because as a society we've really been forced to kind of go into our own space and distance ourselves from everybody. And I think that this play relies so much on the actors' bodies and the story that they're telling with their movement. It's a really great piece to bring us back together: it really shows the human experience"" Gifford said.

""A production like this is not often done and it's especially not done in a gorgeous outdoor venue like the Myriad (Gardens). ... I think that there's gonna be a lot for people to talk about as they leave the theater.""

What is the mission of the new theater?

The new nonprofit theater company looks to provide meaningful art for Oklahomans by creating accessible and affordable productions that enhance quality of life for audiences.

""I think we have we have several wonderful well-established theater companies. ... I think one of the things that makes it really different is that it is led by such a young talent and they have an energy where they're really looking to bridge audiences"" said Chandra Boyd who is chair of Southern Plains Productions' board of directors.

Gifford got got his start on the stage at Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma and the Sooner Theatre in Norman. He attended Oklahoma City's Classen School of Advanced Studies until he took the chance to study at the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan.

""He really had a passion for coming back to Oklahoma City and bringing new theater"" said Boyd who is deputy director of the Oklahoma Arts Council.

""He's really focused on engaging theater theater that's very accessible not just from a price point — although price is very important. But (he's) really drawing in different types of audiences to theater offering opportunities for young talent and emerging talent to have more of an opportunity in theater to be cast in productions and lead the direction and set design and that sort of thing. Also he specifically went towards the Myriad Gardens because he wanted theater to be something that was just very comfortable.""

What can people expect from Southern Plains Productions?

Now a bachelor of fine arts student in the musical theater program at Otterbein University in Westerville Ohio Gifford said he envisions that Southern Plains productions will primarily stage shows in the summer and provide Oklahoma City audiences a chance to see future stars of Broadway film and television in action.

""I want to bring things that aren't usually seen around this area: new productions new works and maybe classics told in a different way with a spin on them ... and new actors that you don't normally see performing in Oklahoma"" Gifford said.

""Our casting pool is nationwide so we're really able to bring in the best of the best to Oklahoma to do these shows. And it's really exciting. Shows next year the possibilities truly are endless.""

(AP) — Even as railroads are operating longer and longer freight trains that sometimes stretch for miles the companies have drastically reduced staffing levels prompting unions to warn that moves meant to increase profits could endanger safety and even result in disasters.

More than 22% of the jobs at railroads Union Pacific CSX and Norfolk Southern have been eliminated since 2017 when CSX implemented a cost-cutting system called Precision Scheduled Railroading that most other U.S. railroads later copied. BNSF the largest U.S. railroad and the only one that hasn’t expressly adopted that model has still made staff cuts to improve efficiency and remain competitive.

The railroads acknowledge they have cut staff lengthened trains and made other adjustments to reduce spending but they are adamant none of the changes increase dangers. Regulators at the Federal Railroad Administration say they are tracking the changes and that the data so far does not show the new operating model is unsafe. But unions counter that with the stakes so high any time a train derails the new system is risky.

“Every time the wheels come off the rail it’s kind of like buying a lottery ticket to the big disaster” said Jason Cox with the carmen division of the Transportation Communications Union.

Precision Scheduled Railroading calls for running fewer longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. The railroads also operate their trains on more of a set schedule now with fewer stops and pickups and they have eliminated shorter less-profitable routes.

By increasing the length of trains railroads can reduce total trips cut down on the number of engines and railcars needing maintenance and manage with fewer employees. Some trains now stretch longer than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers). Union Pacific said the average of its maximum train length has grown more than 30% to 9250 feet which is 1.75 miles (2.8 kilometers) since it started using the new operating model in 2018 and the railroad is expanding track sidings throughout its network to accommodate much longer trains.

The railroads say they abide by federal regulations for car and signal inspections and that human inspections are supplemented by high-tech systems that can scan tracks and railcars for defects.

They also say safety has improved overall over the past five years. All the major railroads issued statements defending their safety records and citing investments they have made in their networks.

“Across the board I do not see evidence of our workforce at Union Pacific being rushed overworked or put in harm’s way. I just don’t see it statistically” said Lance Fritz CEO of Union Pacific the nation’s second-largest railroad.

CSX officials said most of the key safety measures they track like employee injuries and train accidents have improved since it started using the Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model.

“We do not move freight at the expense of the safety of our employees or the communities where we operate” CSX spokeswoman Cindy Schild said.

The head of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio last week asked the Government Accountability Office to study Precision Scheduled Railroading’s impact on safety and the industry overall.

Independent expert David Clarke director of the University of Tennessee’s Center for Transportation Research said the safety data is inconclusive.

“Right now I just haven’t seen anything to demonstrate that it’s definitely having a negative impact on safety” Clarke said.

However the union coalition Transportation Trades Department notes the amount of time carmen have to inspect each car in a train has been reduced by more than half — from three minutes to just 60 seconds. Also staffing cuts mean less-trained train crews are often handling those inspections the group says.

“From the conductor side we’re basically finding things that are just obvious” said Greg Hynes national legislative director with SMART-TD union that represents conductors.

The unions also say that most signalmen who maintain railroad crossing guards and safety signals along the rails have seen their territories grow by 150% leaving little time for maintenance work once required tests are completed.

“As maintenance gets neglected. then obviously the failures go up” said Tim Tarrant a vice president with the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen.

Overtime is also up which the unions say increases fatigue and the chance that a safety defect could be missed.

Unions acknowledge it’s part of their mission to maintain or increase staffing levels but members said they’re more motivated by the potential for disasters such as a 2013 derailment in Canada that killed 47 people in the town of Lac Megantic and caused millions of dollars in damage or a 2005 derailment in Graniteville South Carolina where nine people were killed and more than 250 treated for exposure to toxic chlorine gases.

Former CSX employee Kasondra Bird said safety concerns led her to resign in December after 24 years with the railroad even though she didn’t have another job lined up. As a conductor operating trains by remote control in a Grand Rapids Michigan railyard she went from switching 150 cars a day to 300 to 350 each shift.

Bird said some workers skipped meal and bathroom breaks to keep up.

“I was hoping to stay a lot longer but if it means my safety it’s not going to do me any good staying another day if that means I’m not going to come home” said Bird who is a 45-year-old single mother. “Safety and the well being of employees have definitely taken a backseat to production.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYWJhbWFuZXdzY2VudGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE1L2FsYWJhbWFzLWhoaC1zYW5pdGF0aW9uLWhhcy10aGUtcG9ydGFibGUtc29sdXRpb24tdG8tYS1wcmVzc2luZy1uZWVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alabama's HHH Sanitation has the portable solution to a pressing need,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.alabamanewscenter.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The project will convert 272 guest rooms to make 281 residential units in a lesser-developer corner of the state capitol overlooking the American River. The Ezralow Company is responsible for the development via Bercut-Railyard LLC.

The 6.7-acre Hawthorn Suites hotel property offers lodging across six three-story hotel buildings a restaurant building and separate laundry facilities. Ezralow’s proposal will include the architectural upgrading of the exteriors with extensive renovation for all structures except the restaurant. The total structural footprint will not increase.

Once complete the project will include 194680 square feet with 2530 square feet for the community pool building 186270 square feet for residential use and 8400 square feet for the restaurant. On-site parking will be included for 302 vehicles across 113380 square feet and space for 144 bicycles.

R.L. Davidson Architects is responsible for the architecture with LPAS in charge of the landscaping. The proposed redesign of the structure includes a variety of design styles on each structure. Facades will transition from shingle siding to a barn-like board and batten paneling while portions will be clad with corrugated metal siding.

Gala Construction will be the main contractor. The job is expected to cost $2 million with no given timeline for completion.

In April Americans would celebrate the first Earth Day marking the dawn of the global environmental movement. In Washington the White House was finalizing plans for a new Environmental Protection Agency and Clean Air Act. General Motors had just promised “pollution-free cars” by 1980. And 50 miles south of Los Angeles Irvine Company executives were unfurling plans for a brand-new green city.

The City of Irvine was rigorously designed to be the heart of an environment “where nature and man both prosper” as the Company announced in an enthusiastic press release on March 19 1970. The blueprint delivered that day to Orange County planners included an unusual promise: Irvine residents “will live in an environment that is as attractive as balanced and as enduring as the science of urban planning can make it.”

This was a striking commitment even in the context of that era’s green ambitions. Yet it arose from a singular set of circumstances. A single corporation held claim to 93000 acres of undeveloped land – six times the size of Manhattan – and had determined to maintain control of it master-planning its development.

Irvine was neither the first nor the largest modern city to be designed from the ground up. More than two centuries earlier Washington D.C. was planned by the French former revolutionary fighter Pierre Charles L’Enfant. Brasilia Brazil’s brand-new master-planned capital was inaugurated in 1960.

And in 1964 while Irvine was still on the drawing board the small woodsy town of Reston Virginia planned by a New York developer would become known as a pioneering effort to avoid the miseries of suburban sprawl.

Still Irvine was special in one major way. Its fortune in having a single owner for the city’s land and its natural surroundings would pave the way for a long-lasting and mutually rewarding collaboration between a private company and local City Council members.

On Dec. 28 1971 Irvine’s 10000 inhabitants embraced their good luck overwhelmingly voting to incorporate as a new city.

The Founding Father

Irvine is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. But the city’s unique history began more than 100 years earlier.

In 1846 James Irvine then an impoverished 19-year-old immigrant arrived in New York fleeing the Irish potato famine. After making his way to San Francisco he sold food and provisions to gold rush miners and made his fortune by investing in real estate. At age 37 Irvine headed to Southern California where he discovered what he called the “most delightful” land he had ever seen in or out of the state. The Irvine Company dates its start from 1864 when Irvine and two partners whom he later bought out began acquiring vast tracts of former Spanish and Mexican land grants. These would include the 93000-acre Irvine Ranch today just an hour’s drive south of downtown Los Angeles.

Priceless Pristine Land

Thanks to a long line of conscientious stewards much of the land that first enchanted James Irvine more than 150 years ago still looks a lot like it did then. Descendants of the eagles hawks mountain lions badgers and scores of species of butterflies that Irvine saw on his first horseback forays still make the Ranch their home.

The Ranch stretches for 9 miles along the Pacific Coast and 22 miles inland to the Cleveland National Forest. Its landscapes are as varied as they are often visually stunning ranging from remote canyons and mountain watersheds to grasslands oak woodlands coves and beaches. Its ecological treasures include one of Southern California’s largest coastal freshwater marshes and the 5500-acre Limestone Canyon home to a striking geological formation called the “Sinks” sometimes compared to a miniature Grand Canyon.

The Ranch belongs to one of the world’s few regions with a Mediterranean climate of mild winters and warm summers. Scientists have distinguished the area as one of 36 biodiversity “hot spots” due to its wealth of rare and vulnerable plant and animal species. The list of flora and fauna endemic to this corner of the continent includes Tecate cypress trees the Nutall’s woodpecker and the endangered California gnatcatcher a songbird that lives in coastal sage scrub.

The Ranch property encompasses roughly one-fifth of modern Orange County home to more than 3 million people and many more millions of yearly visitors drawn by attractions including Disneyland and some of the world’s most beautiful beaches. The Irvine Company initially used the land to raise cattle and sheep but later expanded into agriculture. By 1910 the Ranch was the most productive agricultural location in California expanding into crops including oranges cauliflower and grapes.

Still the land had a much more unusual destiny in store.

A Struggle to Stop Smog and Sprawl

By the 1950s the outside world was starting to intrude on James Irvine’s paradise. Marines and other members of the military from all over the country who had been trained or stationed in Southern California during World War II had fallen in love with the climate and scenery and brought their families west to start new lives. A frenzy of freeway building made it easier for those with jobs in Los Angeles to commute to homes near forests and fresh air. But now in many parts of the region smog and traffic had reached appalling levels. From 1950 to 1987 Orange County’s population multiplied tenfold from roughly 200000 to more than 2 million. Urban sprawl from the north and west was approaching like “oozing molasses” in the words of one Irvine Company executive.

The rapidly growing population put pressure on the Company to subdivide and sell off its properties. Surrounding cities including Newport Beach and Santa Ana sought to annex some of the land. The Company resisted seeking an alternative solution. It found one in 1959 thanks to an already-celebrated architect named William Pereira. University of California regents had hired Pereira to find a site for a new campus. He took them on a tour of 23 sites ending with the one he liked best: The Irvine Ranch. Pereira already had a larger plan in mind. He envisioned a 1000-acre university within a “city of intellect” free from “the tragedies of helter-skelter planning of the impossible traffic the sprawling disorganization” he had seen all over California. He proposed creating a series of master-planned villages where resident families would be able to walk to schools and shopping leaving their cars in their garages.

Architecture critic Alan Hess who was such a fan of Irvine’s Master Plan that he made his home here in 2004 would call it the “largest most successful application of important progressive planning ideas since 1900.”

The Irvine Company embraced Pereira’s concept and in September 1960 transferred title to 1000 acres to the UC system for a symbolic fee of $1 a gesture required by the terms of the Company’s charter. The land sale marked a fundamental change for the Company requiring it to be “proactive rather than reactive in the Ranch’s transformation from its agricultural past to its urban future” as one executive expressed it. In the process the Company assumed a new long-term role as “Master Community Builder.”

Three years later as the bulldozers graders and carpenters went to work Time magazine put Pereira’s portrait on its cover a distinction shared that year by the likes of Muhammad Ali and Robert Kennedy. The magazine praised Pereira for his “early environmental awareness.” The architect understood that the new city had to be a financial success but also hoped it would serve as a model for a more civilized lifestyle with more respect for nature than U.S. suburbs had yet produced.

A Blueprint for a Green Utopia

Irvine Company planners shared Pereira’s hope of combatting what one of them called “a crisis of the spirit” in American suburbs.

“In the smaller towns monotony is king. In the larger cities the scattering of major community facilities has created an urban sprawl with which it is impossible for any man to identify” the 1970 press release said.

The new city would be “totally master-planned” from its roads to its utilities to its homes factories and schools anticipating needs more than 30 years in the future. Its hub would be the campus of the new University of California Irvine with spokes extending into the surrounding residential area. Irvine’s most distinctive characteristic would be self-contained residential “villages” linked by forested corridors. This would greatly reduce dependence on cars as Pereira envisioned because within a 10-minute walk along a greenbelt residents could reach destinations including an elementary school playground recreation center and community pools. At maximum they would walk 15 minutes to reach a shopping center with a market restaurants hardware store banks and barbershop.

Architecture critic Alan Hess who was such a fan of Irvine’s Master Plan that he made his home here in 2004 would call it the “largest most successful application of important progressive planning ideas since 1900.” Many other future residents just liked what they saw: a distinctively family-friendly and environmentall smart city. In September 1976 more than 7000 prospective buyers competed in a lottery for the first 221 homes for sale in the new village of Woodbridge.

A Deeper Shade of Green"
LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1ib2VpbmctNzM3LWRlbnZlci1sYXMtdmVnYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: My first Southwest Airlines flight in nearly 18 months,"Southwest Airlines is one of the largest domestic carriers in the U.S.

The airline known for its lightning-fast turnaround times between arrival and departure operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet with more than 4000 daily peak departures before the pandemic.

Though Southwest blankets most of the country with its blue red and yellow jets — in fact the carrier has launched or announced 17 new destinations since the pandemic began — its route map has a noticeable gap in coverage in New York City. Southwest flies to just 12 cities from LaGuardia (LGA) and it doesn't serve New York-JFK and no longer flies to Newark (EWR) per Cirium schedules.

So being based in lower Manhattan I don't frequently fly with Southwest. My last flight with the Dallas-based carrier was in January 2020 from Oakland to Seattle.

Fast forward nearly 18 months (and a pandemic) later and I had another opportunity to fly with Southwest. I needed to get between Denver and Las Vegas so instead of flying United Frontier or Spirit (which I've all recently reviewed) I decided to change it up and choose Southwest.

Read on for how it went.

An elevated departure experience

All three of America's traditional U.S. network carriers operate a large network of airport lounges both at hubs and popular outstations.

Southwest with its low fares and all-coach cabins doesn't have any lounges so you'll need to wait in the terminal.

However since I was flying from Denver I had the opportunity to visit the recently opened American Express Centurion Lounge located just steps away from Southwest's gates in the C concourse. Having access to the lounge was a great way to spend an hour catching up on work and grabbing a last-minute bite to eat.

Unlike airline-branded lounges Amex outposts as well as lounges that belong to the Priority Pass network can be accessed regardless of which airline you're flying meaning that tickets on Southwest (and its competitors) qualify for access.

Sitting in the gate area would've been fine too though it got quite crowded as the flight departure drew closer.

Business Select was worth the investment

I booked roughly a week before departure and decided to splurge for Southwest's most expensive fare class Business Select. The carrier offers three fares for its flights which were priced at $195 for Wanna Get Away $233 for Anytime and $273 for Business Select for my short two-hour hop.

I thought the $75 upgrade to Business Select was reasonable and worthwhile.

For one Anytime and Business Select tickets are fully refundable to the original form of payment. Wanna Get Away fares on the other hand can be changed or canceled for free but the value must be reused by the originally ticketed passenger within 12 months of the booking date.

When I booked my trip my meeting in Las Vegas wasn't 100% confirmed — there was still a chance I might need to cancel. Had I needed to cancel a Wanna Get Away fare I would've been stuck with Travel Funds that I might not have used within a year.

Business Select also includes free same-day confirmed changes which could've come in handy if I arrived at the airport well ahead of departure as well as a host of other perks.

But best of all by purchasing Business Select I significantly improved my chances of scoring an exit-row extra-legroom seat.

Southwest doesn't have assigned seating. Rather you board in an assigned order based on the order in which you checked in and once on the plane you can choose whatever seat you'd like.

Business Select guarantees you a boarding position within A1 to A15. I checked into my flight right at the 24-hour mark and snagged the coveted A1 position.

I was first on the plane after a group of pre-boarders (who are barred from sitting in the exit row) so I grabbed my favorite seat on the carrier's 737-700 the port side exit-row window that doesn't have a seat in front of it.

The seats are actually quite comfortable

My flight was operated by a nine-year-old Boeing 737-700 registered N968WN outfitted with 143 coach seats arranged in a 3-3 configuration.

Each seat has an average pitch of 31 inches and a width between 15.5 and 17 inches.

Unlike other low-cost carriers the seats on the Southwest jet were noticeably well-padded and actually quite comfortable for the two-hour ride to Vegas.

All seats sport roughly the same amount of legroom except for the bulkhead and exit row.

No screens no problem

Southwest doesn't outfit its jet with seat-back entertainment screens. Instead the carrier offers free streaming entertainment which was more than enough to keep me occupied on the short hop.

This includes 12 channels of live TV and 49 pre-loaded movies for the month of May with the full list of titles available here.

Additionally the carrier offers free inflight messaging through iMessage and WhatsApp.

If you want to upgrade to full internet access that'll set you back a modest $8 per device. Speeds were okay at 10 Mbps download but just 0.55 Mbps upload. Another generous move on Southwest's part is that the Wi-Fi package can be used across all connecting flights on the same day as your initial purchase.

There's no power…

Unfortunately Southwest doesn't offer in-seat power outlets or USB ports on any of its Boeing 737s.

That means you'll need to make sure your devices are fully charged before boarding or travel with a portable battery pack to keep your electronics juiced up.

For longer flights the lack of power outlets could be make-or-break for a business traveler.

…or juice

Right now the airline doesn't offer juice for your devices nor for human consumption.

Southwest initially suspended all onboard beverages and snacks due to the pandemic. However as of mid-March 2021 the airline is now serving a limited selection of non-alcoholic beverages and snacks for flights over 250 miles. These include Coke Diet Coke and 7Up in addition to water. For all other flights snack and beverage service is still temporarily suspended.

On my flight the friendly flight attendants passed through the cabin taking drink orders. They then returned with pre-poured cups filled with our drink preference. Though Southwest is ""still limiting selections to support the wellbeing and comfort of our Customers and Employees"" the airline is noticeably behind its competitors on returning to pre-pandemic levels of inflight service.

You still won't find any hot beverages juices or alcohol on Southwest. (Since the airline isn't serving alcohol right now it's extending any expiring drink coupons through at least the end of 2021.)

The airline used to offer a selection of snacks to choose from but that's now been replaced with a non-branded snack mix containing pretzels cheddar cheese squares and ranch bagel chips.

The crew really sets Southwest apart

All things considered my Southwest flight wasn't much different than the average run-of-the-mill domestic hop — except for the crew.

Everyone I interacted with from the Denver-based check-in agent to the inflight crew seemed genuinely excited and happy to be there. I was welcomed back to Southwest multiple times during my travel journey and I even witnessed flight attendants cracking jokes with customers throughout the flight something I rarely see on the other network carriers like American or United.

On my flight there were seven passengers who use wheelchairs who needed to pre-board. Both pilots had grabbed a bite to eat in the terminal before boarding and perhaps most impressively instead of just walking back down the jetway to the cockpit they both escorted the passengers onto the plane.

Every airline has a mix of friendly and less friendly employees but in my experience it's the crew more than anything that really sets Southwest apart.

If you're a large company that is.

Southwest Airlines has managed for the most part to turn it into an artform.

Its corporate attitude seems relaxed even verging on the human. Its employees are often free to express themselves wittily. Even their planes have a certain democratic air with no real snooty section separating the haves from the have-lesses.

Something though may have happened during Covid to shift the airline to a posture between cocky and galling. I confess it's been getting on my very last wick.

You're Going Whether You Like It Or Not.



You see I keep getting marketing emails from Southwest. Many airlines use this method. I've not seen any however that offer such blatant piffling nonsense wrapped in a veneer of sloppy psychology.

It began last September. I received an email headlined: ""$59 to Vegas is still in your cart.""

I stared and wondered whether I'd been imbibing beyond my limits the previous evening. It can't have been so as I never imbibe beyond my limits officer.

When then could I have put a $59 Vegas fare in my cart? This couldn't have happened especially as the idea of flying to Vegas in the middle of a pandemic was as appealing as swimming in an Irkutsk lake with Vladimir Putin.

I ignored the email thinking that perhaps Southwest had got its Matyszczyks in a twist and the email was intended for some other non-related Matyszczyk.

You've Left Something Behind. Your Gall.



October though brought another mind-testing email: ""$99 to Denver is still available.""

No I hadn't been contemplating flying to Denver. No I've never flown to Denver with Southwest in my life. No I hadn't been anywhere near the Southwest site.

But I still wanted to be forgiving. Perhaps this was merely a route that wasn't being booked and Southwest was desperate for anyone to get on the plane.

Thankfully Southwest gave it a rest over Christmas and New Year. In March though the nonsense began again: ""You left something behind: Panama City FL for $103.""

Would you believe me if I told you that I'd left nothing behind that I've never contemplated voluntarily going to Panama City and that I do realize there's a Panama City in Florida?

Would you also believe me that this supposed trick of the mind had me of a mind to call Southwest and verge on the rude?

Instead I kept these emails and only just opened them months later. Inside they offer no hint that I've left anything behind at all. They don't begin with: ""Remember when you were thinking of flying to Panama City?"" They don't have a cart with my Panama City flight nestling within.

I worry about the psychology of using technology to question a customer's sanity. Emailing a customer they did something when they manifestly didn't seems like the equivalent of me suggesting Southwest is entirely lovable when it really isn't.

The emails you see have kept on coming. Last month for example: ""You left something behind: Charleston for $78.""

I wouldn't mind so much if I'd been contemplating flying to Charleston. I wouldn't mind so much if I'd once flown to Charleston and really liked it. I wouldn't mind so much if I had a long-lost friend who's just moved to Charleston and got back in touch.

But all this was beginning to make me completely reconsider my feelings for Southwest.

Does Annoyance Work?



You might think I'm being excessively reactive. (It wouldn't be the first time you've thought that would it?)

Oh if only you knew me better. I'm as placid as the Adriatic on a July evening. And I know that many other companies use annoyance in the belief that in the end you'll succumb.

But if a brand is lovable I expect it to use e-commerce in as lovable a manner as its humans treat me on its planes. Here it's more like: ""Are you sure you didn't rob that bank last Thursday? Are you sure you haven't lost your mind?""

Southwest isn't relenting. It seems to believe this method of supreme annoyance will get me into its seats. A couple of weeks ago I got this headline: ""You left something behind: Manchester for $121."" What I'm progressively leaving behind is my urge to ever fly Southwest again.

Shut up I hear you say all airlines do exactly this. They don't. Some don't pester all that much at all. And some -- and here I must be grateful that generally far less lovable airline American -- don't question your sanity in the slightest.

American emailed me last week with: ""Fares under $199 for summer travel.""

That one I actually opened. I realized that few of these $199 fares would be to destinations I coveted but at least the communication was honest and didn't try to tell me I was losing my marbles.

I wonder if American has flights to Charleston. I suddenly have the urge to go there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL29waW5pb24vb3V0bG9vay9hcnRpY2xlL09waW5pb24tVGV4YXMtcXVpdC1wbGF5aW5nLXJ1cmFsLWFuZC1hY3QtbGlrZS0xNjE3NzUyNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Texas act like the urban powerhouse you are,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Opinion-Texas-quit-playing-rural-and-act-like-16177527.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL29waW5pb24vb3V0bG9vay9hcnRpY2xlL09waW5pb24tVGV4YXMtcXVpdC1wbGF5aW5nLXJ1cmFsLWFuZC1hY3QtbGlrZS0xNjE3NzUyNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uYy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzE1L3BpcGVsaW5lLWltcGFjdC0tdG93LXRydWNrcy1yZWFkeS10by1iYWlsLXBlb3BsZS1vdXQtaWYtdGhleS1ydW4tb3V0LW9mLWdhcy3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tow Trucks ready to bail people out if they run out of gas,"CARY N.C. — Gas remains scarce in the triangle following the reopening of the Colonial Pipeline on Wednesday night.

Colt-Land Towing & Recovery in Cary has been in businesses for 22 years.

Jackson Wetherby has been helping his step-father run the business for the past three years.

Wetherby said normal protocol for a driver who ran out of gas would be to bring them gas to refuel or take them to a nearby gas station. But he said due to panic buying that's licked the pumps dry that's currently not an option.

“Our biggest way is just trying to help people get their vehicles to a safe area to be able to wait until there is gas available” Wetherby said.

He said on a normal day they only receive one to two calls for help.

""It’s actually been keeping people at home for the most part"" Wetherby said.

Wetherby says it's only a matter of time before the calls start coming in.

For drivers who may find themselves teetering on the edge of empty and not able to make it to a gas station or find gas near them Wetherby offered some advice.

""If you realize you’re going to run out of gas before you get somewhere safe just make sure you’re pulling off the side of the road away from a lot of traffic. It gives you space so you're safe and away from traffic. It also gives us space to come and help you in any way"" Wetherby said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3Bhc3Nlbmdlci1vZi1zaXplLWRhbmdlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Does A Passenger Of Size Become A Passenger Of Danger?,"Here’s an interesting issue I want to approach in a very sensitize way. When does a passenger of size (a large or overweight passenger) on an airplane become a danger such that transport itself places the safety of others in danger?

Should A Passenger Of Size Be Permitted To Block The Aisle On A Flight?

A Live and Let’s Fly reader sent me the following note:

I was on a United flight recently and the passenger across the aisle from me was so huge that he took up not only his seat and the seat next to him but the entire aisle as well. Flight attendants were unable to move their cart past him and passengers struggled to navigate around him in order to use the lavatory in the front of the economy class cabin. I was scared not only for the passenger but for those around him. He literally blocked the aisle. What would have happened in the case of an emergency?

The reader sent two pictures as well which I’ve included above and below because it does not show the gentleman’s face. I post this with caution because he is a human being and the point of this post is not to mock or denigrate him in any way.

As you can see the man is indeed blocking the aisle:

I’ve long defended the right of passengers with disabilities especially young children to enjoy special accommodations onboard including exceptions to the mask mandate. In many of these cases people cannot take care of themselves which renders them a potential hazard in case of an emergency.

But the only correct answer for those passengers is that they be welcomed onboard with the same dignity as other passengers. So often the trope is that overweight people simply are undisciplined and cannot control themselves. I personally think that is a rather simplistic way to look at the situation and ultimately not helpful in determining who should be allowed or banned from commercial flights.

Regulatory issues of accommodation aside there is no doubt that this man posed a threat to others by being so large unable to move easily and thus created a risk.

But I don’t see any other solution than to let the man fly and accept the risk just like so many other exceptions we make…

CONCLUSION

This is a twist on the usual passenger of size issue because the man was blocking the aisle. Without debating personal responsibility versus genetics I simply don’t see any other path forward except for letting the man travel as he did. Banning him ushers in a whole host of problems…

What are your thoughts on this issue? Insensitive or crude comments will be deleted."

With the US job market heating up a shift supervisor at an Atlanta Starbucks told Insider she's leaving for a job with better pay and benefits. The final straw for leaving her job of two years she said was realizing how her pay compared to the increasingly pricey drinks Starbucks sells.

""The thing that really radicalized me was that our starting wage ($9) is less than one average customer's ticket"" she told Insider.

Though pay varies across Starbucks locations this supervisor's experience is at the heart of the company's strategy. The coffee chain relies on fewer customers who spend more on customized drinks. In the second quarter of 2021 US same store sales increased by 9% despite a 10% decline in number of transactions. The growth was driven by a 22% increase in average ticket size as orders grow larger and more complicated. Additions like different milks and sauces can increase that base price of a drink.

Mobile orders and drive-thru orders tend to be larger and more costly than in-store according to Starbucks earnings so many of the most complicated orders are coming through these channels. Drive-thru and pick-up mobile orders made up 80% of transactions before the coronavirus pandemic and have increased since then.

The chain continues to add customization options and new multi-step drinks even as competitors pare down offerings to make drive-thrus more efficient. While drive-thru menu offerings are trending slimmer at most restaurants some experts don't expect that from Starbucks. ""They have a ton of customization and that's not going away. They believe it's a strength"" Mark Kalinowski founder of Kalinowski Equity Research told Insider.

In 2020 Starbucks lagged behind coffee competitor Dunkin' in terms of speed according to QSR's annual drive-thru study. While Starbucks is working to make drive-thrus more efficient it isn't trying to be the fastest drive-thru around Kalinowski says. ""Customization is much more meaningful for Starbucks"" he says even if it means slightly longer waits.

Instead Starbucks is more of a destination where customers spend time and money for a drink made to their exact specifications.

Workers say customization and speed are at odds

Erika a Starbucks shift supervisor in Ohio told Insider that as the business has changed to focus on customizations through drive-thru and mobile the company has not adjusted staffing needs appropriately to deal with the new volume.

""Drinks are becoming increasingly more complicated as they are offered unlimited modifications and people are still bored from lockdown so they visit us for a sense of normalcy"" she told Insider explaining that the heavily modified drinks take more staff to make and keep lines moving.

Starbucks did not respond to Insider's request for comment about customizing orders and the time they might take for workers.

Another supervisor in Pennsylvania told Insider that situation is the same at her location. ""Custom drinks from social media like TikTok are also increasing the need for labor. These drinks are getting more and more complicated while the company is pushing for drive-thru times under 40-50 seconds"" she told Insider. These demands create an ""impossible standard for partners to uphold"" with ""a large amount of stress on partners.""







While Erika would like to make those drinks for customers she says supervisors expect the impossible with strict limits on wait times in the drive-thru. It isn't sustainable she says and creates a problem because people expect Starbucks to act as a quick service restaurant.""Simplification of our menu and restricting modifications would improve our speed or set us up for success by labeling us as a custom beverage establishment that prides itself on the limitless modifications"" she told Insider.

""We can't do both. At least not staffed the way we are.""

The coffee giant is the latest to update its mask policy after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new masking guidelines.

Masks will still be required at locations where local or state regulations mandate them.

Masks not required:Walmart Costco Trader Joe's Publix no longer require masks for vaccinated customers. See the list.

The CDC said Thursday that fully vaccinated Americans for the most part no longer need to wear masks indoors and don’t have to wear masks outdoors even in crowded spaces.

But privately-owned businesses can still require masks which most of the nation's largest retailers started mandating last summer. There are other exceptions for when the CDC recommends masks such as in health care settings transportation hubs such as airports and stations planes and public transportation.

Trader Joe's Walmart Sam's Club Costco and Publix were among the first to confirm updates to mask requirements Friday.

Mask compliance has sparked debates throughout the coronavirus pandemic after Americans received mixed messages from authorities early on over whether they should wear face coverings in public places.

Starbucks started requiring masks nationwide on July 15 weeks after an altercation at a California Starbucks went viral.

In June 2020 Amber Gilles a yoga instructor accused Starbucks barista Lenin Gutierrez of refusing her service for not wearing a mask. Gilles posted his photo on Facebook and a GoFundMe campaign ""Tips for Lenin"" was created that raised more than $100000.

Gilles recently filed a lawsuit against Matt Cowan the creator of the GoFundMe and previously requested half of the money raised.

The announcements from the various companies comes shortly after the CDC released new federal guidelines surrounding face coverings stating that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can now be indoors or outdoors without masks or social distancing in most cases.

""The science is clear: If you are fully vaccinated you are protected and you can start doing the things that you stopped doing because of the pandemic"" the CDC said in a statement on Thursday about those who are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine or two weeks after the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot.

However the government agency is still leaving the final decision on mask mandates to local and state governments which can continue to require face coverings for fully vaccinated individuals. Private businesses such as many grocery store chains and restaurants can also continue to require masks on their premises.

The most anticipated new additions are 24-ounce multicolored dome cold cups some of which feature a kaleidoscope design motif beneath its lid.

Rumors circulating on social media suggest that as many as 25 cups mugs and water bottles among other merch could be released between now and August.

The flowers are blooming the days are getting longer and like other surefire signs of summer Starbucks fans are spotting brand new merchandise and menu items at their local café.

Customers were likely intrigued this month to hear that the coffee giant unveiled a brand new drink the Strawberry Funnel Cake Frappuccino! as well as a few other beloved seasonal treats like the Unicorn Cake Pop. But diehard Starbucks enthusiasts are definitely more excited by the arrival of a new line of coffee cold cups water bottles and mugs.

The newest line of merch features gorgeous marbled designs and bright ombré motifs that any true cup collector will love. A few standouts include tonal marbled 24-ounce cold cups that emulate waves on the ocean shore plus iridescent ombré grid cold cups and water bottles in a multitude of colors.

Coffee aficionados may be most compelled however by a pale pink opalescent 24-ounce coffee tumbler with a domed lid. The special design also comes in a transparent blue hue but it's unlike any other cold cups released this year. Starbucks has yet to confirm prices on any of these pieces of new merchandise but these cups usually range from $18 to $25.

While the chain has yet to confirm it eagle-eyed social media user @coffeekawaii noticed that one new section featured on Starbucks' merchandise shelves includes a new rainbow dome tumbler designed exclusively for Pride Month in June. The cold cup reportedly sports a kaleidoscope beneath its lid and reflects light in all directions while you enjoy a coffee of your choice. What's more there's a blue-tinted pearlescent mug that's sure to sell out soon.

Other social media users in Facebook groups dedicated to cup hunting and all things Starbucks have shared screenshots of PDFs that indicate more merchandise may be released later in the summer. Starbucks hasn't confirmed any plans but rumors and speculation shared online suggest that an additional batch of cups may land in stores in late June; by our count the full summer collection contains well over 20 pieces of merchandise. We'll update this story as more details and prices become available.

Some social users have claimed they've discovered new cups in standalone Starbucks cafés across the country. But like other merch drops at Starbucks the best chance to purchase these new cups and mugs may be to visit a local Target or grocery retailers with an in-house Starbucks. Those who regularly buy new cups have long headed to Target and stores like Kroger or Safeway to find them first — and getting your grocery shopping done early may be just another excuse to get your hands on yet another cold cup.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks may officially add puppuccinos to its menu soon - and there's evidence it could start selling pet ap,"Starbucks filed a trademark application for ""puppuccino"" this month.

Starbucks declined to say anything else about puppuccinos.

Puppuccinos may soon officially be part of Starbucks' menu a new trademark filing suggests.

The coffee giant applied to trademark the term ""puppuccino"" with the US Patent and Trademark Office on May 4.

Puppuccinos are small amounts of whipped cream served in espresso or sample cups that customers can give to their dogs . They're not officially on Starbucks menus but customers can order whipped cream on the side for free.

""All customers have the ability to order extra whipped cream for a beverage and we've seen customers order this for their dogs. We recommend that pet owners consult with their vet on what treats are best for their pet"" a Starbucks spokesperson told Insider.

The trademark application lists two categories: whipped cream and pet bandanas. While the Starbucks representative did not offer any additional information the trademark suggests the company could eventually sell pet apparel.

There's already a large market for accessories for Starbucks-loving pups. Etsy has hundreds of results for Starbucks pet bandanas made by fans.

The puppuccino is usually associated with Starbucks but other restaurants have adopted similar items for pets . Some Dunkin' locations offer a cup of whipped cream while Shake Shack Culver's and Dairy Queen all have other dog treats available."

Special to The Courier Journal

When St. Xavier senior Hillis Burns scored his fourth goal with three minutes remaining some of his teammates yelled “crown him” while tapping the top of their helmets from the sideline.

Then roughly a minute later Burns scored his fifth goal and freshman Ryder John got on his knees and started bowing towards him. It was that type of night for Burns and the St. Xavier boy’s lacrosse team.

Burns was named MVP for his performance after St. Xavier defeated Trinity 17-8 on Friday night to capture a third straight Kentucky State Lacrosse League tournament championship. It’s the 14th for the program overall.

“Just thankful I did it with a group of guys that I’ve been playing with mostly since fifth grade including guys on Trinity” Burns said. “It’s really good to be on the field with them one last time and I’m really thankful for our last game.”

St. Xavier (17-3) and Trinity (10-5) met already once this season back on March 24th with the Tigers picking up a 12-4 victory. This time around St. Xavier remained in control for most of the game but Trinity made a few runs to keep it close through three quarters.

Trinity sophomore Lucas Osborn scored the first goal of the game in less than two minutes. But St. Xavier answered by scoring four straight goals including back-to-back goals from Burns. The Air Force commit secured a hat trick in the first quarter alone after scoring with less than a minute remaining to give St. Xavier a 5-2 lead.

“He’s (Burns) such a special player” St. Xavier coach Scott Howe said. “He’s hard to cover he’s got an awesome shot he’s got a great stick.”

The Tigers led by as many as five goals in the first half until the Shamrocks scored three straight in the second quarter. Osborn’s second goal cut the St. Xavier lead to only two but the Tigers ended the first half by scoring two goals within a minute of each other.

Senior Ben Hubbs scored his first goal in that sequence and went on to score two more in the third quarter to pick up a hat trick himself. The Bellarmine commit was named KSLL Mr. Lacrosse after the game for his performance this season.

“It’s just been awesome like showing that all the hard work just pays off” Hubbs said. “It’s been a great four years. I played with my brothers the first two and just winning state all-state Mr. Lacrosse is really just overwhelming. It’s awesome.”

In the third and fourth quarters St. Xavier allowed a few goals from Trinity but it was never enough to put the title in question down the stretch.

After the game Howe reflected on the championship while watching his team hoist the trophy. After having last season taken away from the COVID-19 pandemic this championship had something more behind it. He said you can tell how close the team is and how much love they have for each other.

“These guys are just phenomenal” Howe said. “Phenomenal night phenomenal season and doggone it’s just good to get back outside and have some fun.”

Two St. Bonaventure University faculty members have been honored with awards of excellence for the 2020-21 academic year.

Dr. René Hauser associate professor in the School of Education and director of its master’s level inclusive special education program received the Professional Excellence in University Service Award while Dr. Alexander Mazurek adjunct instructor of classics received the Adjunct Faculty Professional Excellence in Teaching Award.

Hauser who has taught at St. Bonaventure since 2004 has a record of service to her campus and community that can be tiring just reading through it. “A list of committees she has not served on would likely be shorter than the long list of committees and task forces she has been a member of and continues to serve” said Dr. Mary Rose Kubal associate professor of political science who served with Hauser on the Faculty Senate.

“Staggering” is how elementary education professor Dr. Adam Brown describes the number of tasks Hauser gladly takes on. “Service work is in René’s blood she never stops” said Brown. “And anyone who has had the pleasure of working with René knows she is extremely productive…she is usually the one volunteering for extra work or being asked do to tasks for which others don’t have the expertise.”

Hauser has chaired the university’s Graduate Council since 2016 is a founding member of the University Planning Commission and since 2011 has served as the School of Education’s assessment and accreditation coordinator work the school’s dean Dr. Lisa Buenaventura said demands “a significant amount of time effort and collaboration.”

Her résumé includes serving on the university’s Faculty Senate; the Honors Council; the Academic Program Evaluation Committee; the University Technology Committee; the Institutional Review Board; the University Diversity Action Committee’s Disability Subcommittee; the Council on Discrimination and Harassment; the School of Education Graduate Admissions Committee; the Center for Attention Learning and Memory; and the Women’s History Month Committee.

In addition Hauser has served on search committees review boards scholarship and grant committees as a conference coordinator task force member peer reviewer for national and regional professional journals and conferences and as adviser to the student Hip Hop team.

Off campus she is a longtime member and officer of Olean’s Zonta Club an international organization devoted to rights of women and girls. She is also a member and Council president at Immanuel Lutheran Church of Olean as well as past-president and member of its Christian Child Care and Preschool board. She has served as a voter registration volunteer and helped start a peer tutoring program at Kenmore West High School in Kenmore New York.

“René is an example of service at work and she has helped many throughout her time at St. Bonaventure” said Dr. David Hilmey dean of the School of Arts and Sciences. “She is well-deserving of the Professional Excellence in Service Award.”

Hauser earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in elementary and special education from the University at Buffalo and her Ph.D. in special education from U.B. in 2006. Prior to coming to St. Bonaventure in 2004 she served as an adjunct instructor at Canisius College; a part-time lecturer at Buffalo State College; a special education teacher at Warsaw Junior and Senior High School in Warsaw New York; and as a special education teacher for BOCES.

Who better to determine a teacher’s effectiveness than his students and the professors who see him in action? Dr. Alexander Mazurek adjunct instructor of classics gets an A from both groups.

“Hire this man for life” a student wrote in an evaluation after taking Mazurek’s Greek and Roman Mythology class. “A great teacher” said another. “A master of online classes” said a third.

A student in his Archaeology of Ancient Greece and Italy course called him “by far the most relatable teacher I have had at Bonaventure.” Others described him as “energetic and passionate” “fun and interesting” “intelligent relatable and humorous.” Another called Mazurek “one of the best professors I’ve had in my four years at St. Bonaventure.”

These are just a sampling from the four pages of favorable student evaluations accompanying the nomination of Mazurek for the excellence in teaching honor.

Mazurek earned his bachelor’s degree in classics and archeology from Boston University his master’s in classics from the University at Buffalo and his doctorate in classics will be conferred at U.B in June. He was a teaching assistant and instructor at U.B. before coming to St. Bonaventure in fall of 2017.

His academic preparation is “first-rate” said Dr. Jeffrey White emeritus professor of classics at St. Bonaventure. Mazurek brings “youth idealism imagination and energy” to the classics department and his interactions with students have an “unselfish collaborative character” White added.

Dr. Theodore Georgian emeritus professor of biology at St. Bonaventure sat in on Mazurek’s Archaeology of Ancient Greece and Italy class in spring semester of 2020. “Simply put it was a great course and Mazurek did a great job of teaching it” said Georgian noting Mazurek employed “vivid illustrations penetrating analyses” and “frequent questions to students” to make the class “easy to follow and yet intellectually stimulating.”

Anahiz Rivera a graduating senior carrying a double major in English and professional & creative writing as well as minors in Latin and classics took a Latin course from Mazurek her sophomore year. “He has been my favorite professor ever since” she said describing him as “knowledgeable organized detail-oriented and committed to helping students do the best they can.”

After that Latin course her sophomore year Rivera would enroll in three more courses taught by Mazurek over the next two years.

“I wish I could take more” she said. “I have become a better student and person through his guidance.”

COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout Begins For Ages 12-15 Amid New CDC Guidelines

On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that fully vaccinated people can limit wearing masks both indoors and outdoors.

Masks can still be required by state local tribal or territorial business and workplace laws according to the CDC. Masks are also still required in crowded places such as public transportation homeless shelters and hospitals.

Following the news eight states adjusted their rules on mask wearing: Connecticut Illinois Kentucky Minnesota Nevada Oregon Pennsylvania and Washington.

On Friday Rock County and La Crosse County lifted their mandates. In Dane and Milwaukee counties the mask mandate still remains.

Later on Friday the Wisconsin Department of Health Services released a statement aligning with the CDC announcement.

“The science is clear: if you are fully vaccinated you are protected and you can start doing the things that you stopped doing because of the pandemic” said DHS Secretary-designee Karen Timberlake. “For vaccinated people this means returning to the Wisconsin way of life we all enjoy.”

The CDC and DHS updates come as children ages 12 to 15 have been given the green light on Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinations from the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Milwaukee Public Schools said Friday that it will be hosting walk-in vaccine clinics for all people age 12 or older starting Monday. Five schools are participating.

Opponents Of Proposal For Ban On Transgender Athletes Say It Would Affect Few

Wisconsin’s transgender community and advocates say that legislation being supported by state Republicans would affect only a few athletes according to sports officials at both the high school and collegiate level. The legislation aims to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s school sports citing unfair competition.

But Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association officials told the Journal Sentinel they could not think of an instance where a transgender athlete has competed in a state tournament.

Quill Graham is the only collegiate transgender athlete — out of almost 5000 total athletes — in Wisconsin. He said the bills are “very ill-informed” and “don’t address a lot of complexities of gender and biology.”

Assembly Speaker Robin Vos R-Rochester said the legislation will move forward in the Assembly. But the bills face a potential veto by Gov. Tony Evers.

Wisconsin Disabled Community Opposes Election Law Changes

Wisconsin voters with disabilities are urging lawmakers to reconsider a pair of Republican-backed bills passed by the state Senate that would make it more difficult to cast absentee ballots.

The measures that passed Tuesday are part of the GOP push to make it harder to vote by mail following Donald Trump’s defeat.

Advocates and those with disabilities said the Republican-backed measures put those with physical challenges at a particular disadvantage.

Both bills must still clear the Assembly and be signed by Gov. Tony Evers before becoming law. Evers is expected to veto them but opponents say they are worried about them coming back years later.

The Festival was canceled in 2020 due to the pandemic and has adjusted this year to operate virtually with all film being streamed online.

“This festival doesn’t only show sort of classy foreign films with subtitles it shows goofy funny entertaining stuff but maybe not the same goofy entertaining stuff that you’re going to find elsewhere” said Ben Reiser the outreach and community engagement manager for Wisconsin Film Festival.

St. Augustine Record USA TODAY NETWORK

Germari Rickerson a member of Boy Scout Troop #63 and a student at St. Augustine High School was recently awarded the prestigious Boy Scouts of America Eagle Scout Award.

During a ceremony at the Scout Troop #63 meeting at Cathedral Parish School’s Bosco House Rickerson accompanied by his mother and father received his Eagle Scout award pin.

Eagle Scout is the highest achievement or rank attainable in the Scouts BSA program. Since its inception in 1910 only 4% of Scouts have earned this rank which requires a lengthy review process. More than 2.5 million youth have earned the Eagle Scout rank. Scouts who earn this highest award can reference their Eagle Scout rank for academic vocational and military recognition including scholarships and advanced enlistment grade. Rickerson is of the 3% Black Scouts to earn this prestigious award.

To qualify for the Eagle Scout award Rickerson achieved a series of significant requirements went through an application process and completed a community service project that called for planning and development that required the leadership of others and was preapproved by the local BSA council.

His Eagle project was the successful design and construction of a storage pantry box for the distribution of non-perishable food items to the homeless at Home Away on State Road 207 in St. Augustine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdnRkaWdnZXIub3JnLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvc3Qtam9obnNidXJ5LXdpbnMtZ3JhbnQtZm9yLWFybW9yeS1jbGVhbnVwLWJvbmQtdm90ZS1wbGFubmVkLXRoaXMteWVhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Johnsbury wins grant for armory cleanup; bond vote planned this year,"The historic armory on Main Street in St. Johnsbury seen on May 14 2021 has been vacant for more than a decade.

ST. JOHNSBURY — The town has won a half-million-dollar grant to clean up its long-blighted armory a significant step in plans to move public safety services into the old building.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency announced the $500000 award Tuesday. St. Johnsbury is one of only two recipients from Vermont this grant cycle — the other being a Northeast Kingdom coalition focused on brownfields.

“We’re one giant step closer to having a real bona fide project at a property we’ve been trying for 12 or 13 years to find a solution (for)” Assistant Town Manager Joe Kasprzak said Friday.

With the EPA money in hand town officials are now waiting to hear about another $500000 grant from the state Vermont Community Development Program. Town representatives are scheduled to meet with state officials about the grant in June.

If all goes as planned Kasprzak said the town will ask residents in late summer or early fall to approve a $4 million to $5 million bond for the entire armory project.

“We couldn’t even give it away basically” he said. The building had been available for years for $1 to any interested developer.

The two-story armory building on Main Street was built in 1916 and operated for decades under the state Board of Armory Commissioners which oversees properties for the Vermont National Guard. In 1975 the board sold the building to the town government and several local departments moved in.

However town officials closed the armory in 2009 because it was too costly to keep it in line with evolving safety codes according to the grant application and has remained vacant since.

In recent years town officials have taken fresh looks at possible uses for the downtown building but contaminants — particularly PCBs or polychlorinated biphenyls used in paint in the basement — blocked those plans.

The floor paint in the armory basement tested for PCB concentrations of up to 5700 parts per million according to grant documents. Officials plan to dispose of the wastes through a facility in Michigan. Safe PCB levels in buildings depend on the size of the human being and the length of exposure and there’s no bright line on safe exposure. However government safety guidelines indicate that materials containing PCBs in concentrations of 50 parts per million or more are regulated.

Developers didn’t want to touch the armory project because of the contamination Kasprzak said and officials received remediation cost estimates between $800000 and $1.3 million.

“That was just an obstacle too large” he said.

But if the town could get grants to lower the net remediation costs officials believed residents would back a bond to finance the whole project.

So last fall officials applied for the EPA grant. Securing the funds the assistant town manager said is a crucial step toward persuading residents to approve the financing.

The town wants to move its police department and regional dispatch center into the armory. They’re now in a building down the street that isn’t structurally sound Kasprzak said. The town fire department which uses the same building has had to store some equipment elsewhere because it is too heavy for the building to handle without risk.

Finding a use for the armory has also been a priority because of its historic value and prominent spot on the town’s main drag.

“The last thing we wanted to do was go build a new structure and leave that building vacant and blighted” Kasprzak said.

If voters approve the financing remediation would occur next spring and summer with construction starting later that year. Officials hope to have the armory occupied in early summer of 2023.

“It’s really important for communities like ours that have brownfields right in the middle of their downtowns that they can seek assistance” Kasprzak said."

Back then Poli kept a few horses and chickens on the farm. Later her son Nolan Thevenet expressed an interest in raising sheep.

Poli had another idea.

“I asked him if he would raise one pig for me because I didn’t like the taste of the pork from the store” she said.

One pig eventually blossomed into Stryker Farm a family-run operation in Saylorsburg Monroe County Pennsylvania that raises beef lamb and pork on pasture.

Poli’s specialty is the farm’s heritage breed pigs which fluctuates between 100 and 300 head. For someone who grew up in the suburbs Poli’s venture into hog farming was a bit unconventional.

When she first asked her son to raise a hog Poli didn’t expect to soon be raising a few hundred pigs as part of a farm business. And when Poli did become a bona fide hog farmer 11 years ago she was 58 years old.

“The learning curve was enormous” Poli said. “I never thought I’d be doing this. I’ve been asked if another woman my age could do this and I said no. I couldn’t have done it without my son. He was the driving force.”

A Free-Range Life

While Thevenet handles the physically strenuous tasks and manages the on-farm store Poli’s strength is in raising heritage-breed hogs in a manner focused on nature and ethics.

At the beginning Thevenet conducted extensive research on which breeds to raise. He and his mother settled on the heritage variety for their ability to thrive in a free-range operation. The heritage breeds have longer legs and a more pronounced snout Poli said which makes them better at roaming the wooded pastures and rooting in the ground. They also have coarser hair she said which allows them to handle being outside in the winter.

Poli does provide open-front shelters for the hogs and sows have their young inside shipping containers altered to serve as farrowing structures.

But the hogs are free to come and go as they please including the sows and piglets.

“The piglets are basically born free-range and that makes them hardy” Poli said. “We let the mothers do what they want and they raise the piglets themselves.”

The pasture life Poli said produces pigs that are more alert and able to fend for themselves. She does have self-feeders in the pastures that supply the hogs with a non-GMO feed mix but it’s up to them when they eat root or wallow.

“I think our pigs are very content. It’s a different kind of life than pigs raised in a building” Poli said.

A Good Routine

It’s also a different kind of life than the one Poli ever imagined for herself. While the farm functions as a business it also serves as the heart of the family. Thevenet manages the farm and store while Poli cares for the hogs. She also has a second business Poli Restoration that deals with the restoration and conservation of paper collectibles such as stamps money maps documents and covers. The studio for the restoration business is attached to the farm store and Poli’s daughter Rebecca Silvius is her partner.

The fact that Poli splits her days between wearing farm-chore clothes while feeding hogs and donning a white lab coat while restoring valuable paper collectibles exemplifies the diverse life she made for herself on the farm nestled in the Pocono Mountains.

For Poli it all centers on the farm and provides a purpose.

“I like the lifestyle and having to go out there every day to work outside with the pigs. The routine of it is a good thing for me” she said.

Now that the difficult learning curve is behind her and the farm is an established success Poli isn’t sure if the family will take the operation in a new direction. They worked hard to get to where they are today she said and even though they’re constantly learning they’ve found comfort in the free-range system they have in place.

And it all started when a woman from the suburbs moved to a farm in the mountains and decided to raise hogs at an age when most people are pondering retirement.

“I used to wonder what we are getting ourselves into by doing this but once it was in the works it wasn’t’ something where you could quit and turn back” Poli said. “We tried to create something unique in how we raise and feed pigs and it was something we never did before.

“Now we know where we’re going and we know we can run this farm. And through it all it taught me not to be afraid of the unknown.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvYS5hZnJpY29tLm1pbC92aWRlby8yNDAzMi9janRmLWhvYS13ZWxjb21lcy1hLW5ldy1jb21tYW5kZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CJTF - HOA,"Multinational Exercise Bull Shark 24-2 reinforces U.S. bonds with allies and partners The objective of exercise Bull Shark 24-2 was to strategize simulate and carry out various personnel recovery scenarios involving land sea and air units while ensuring effective communication among all participants.

How the T-Mobile Military Discount Works

T-Mobile offers two different flat-fee discount plans for qualifying military members. The Magenta Military plan is $25/line; the Magenta MAX Military plan is $35/line.

Those discounted rates are substantially lower than the standard Magenta and Magenta MAX plans from T-Mobile which are $47 and $57 per line respectively. Those prices make T-Mobile worth checking out.

Both are unlimited plans and include up to four lines plus 5G access for compatible devices; an additional two lines (for a total of six) can receive a 50 percent discount. The plans vary between streaming speeds mobile hotspot data data and texting speeds and in-flight Wi-Fi access.

You must confirm military service verification within 45 days of signup and AutoPay is required.

Who Qualifies for the Discount

The military member must be the account holder and apply for the discount unless it's a Gold Star family member. If an active duty member is deployed T-Mobile will allow a spouse or another family member to apply for the member and verify eligibility.

So rather than rehash most of the commentary out there our take on the SK3 is going to come in several parts and focus on a few things that we consider to be interesting and worthwhile about this hybrid cell phone and data device. Part one deals with the new Sidekick’s camera and phone reception.

We’ve said a number of times that we were not impressed with the cameras on Motorola’s various iTunes phones: virtually every company is switching to decent 1.3 Megapixel (1280×1024) or 2.0 Megapixel (1600×1200) cameras these days and Motorola has been releasing .3 Megapixel (640×480) phones for U.S. customers. Its first exception to that – the RAZR V3i – has a 1.3 Megapixel camera that’s so blurry that you can barely distinguish it from a .3 camera. So we were glad to see that Danger did the right thing with Sidekick 3 not only upgrading its camera from .3 to 1.3 Megapixels but actually making very substantial detail gathering improvements in the process. This shot is from the SK2 – click on it to see a full-sized version.

We did some direct indoor and outdoor comparisons between the Sidekick 2 and 3 cameras just to see how much better the new model performed.

In both of our sample scenes below you’ll see considerable improvements in the SK3 which are magnified even further when you open the shots in an image editing program and zoom in. To help you make the comparisons quickly we’ve done some zooming and cropping for you. Below is the same shot as above taken with the SK3 then a series of crop and resize comparisons. Again you can click on this shot to see a full-sized version which is much larger than the SK2 version. You won’t realize the scope of difference until you click.

This comparison shows how much additional detail the SK3 camera captures natively: the SK2 and SK3 pictures are cropped and shown at actual pixel size.

This comparison shows how much better the SK3 picture looks than the SK2 picture when the SK3 picture is shrunk down to SK2 size. The detail difference is striking.

Similarly this comparison shows how much better the SK3 looks than the SK2 when you try to scale the SK2 picture up to match the native SK3 size.

In this second series of shots the SK3’s strengths become more apparent: it is more color accurate (especially indoors) than the SK2 was though it’s also fair to say that neither camera is truly great in this regard. You’ll also note that the SK3 camera remains noisy and a little less than perfectly sharp – not as bad as the SK2’s but still not the rival of a dedicated digital camera. It also has a tendency to blow out highlights – bright spots in a photograph – rendering them all white or super-bright.

We’ve noticed that there’s still a shutter lag on the SK3 camera – somewhat annoying – but it’s compensated for by several major improvements. Our unit came with a 64MB miniSD card which now stores lots of pictures – the exact number depends on the JPEG mode you’re in and resolution but ranges from around 60 to hundreds. The SK3 makes transfers from phone memory to the card’s memory super-easy and also includes a USB cable that lets you transfer the photos directly off the memory card onto a PC or Mac.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxhd2FyZW9ubGluZS5jb20vdmlkZW9zL25ld3MvY3JpbWUvMjAyMS8wNS8xNi9lbHNtZXJlLXBvbGljZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS1hcHBhcmVudC1ob21pY2lkZS1tZXRyby10LW1vYmlsZS1zdG9yZS1zYXR1cmRheS81MTE0ODE4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elsmere police investigate apparent homicide at Metro by T-Mobile store Saturday,"Elsmere police investigate apparent homicide at Metro by T-Mobile store Saturday

My sister is a doctor in a suburb of Washington D.C. and her daughter’s pediatrician was also a woman. Initially my niece wanted to follow in their footsteps. Then she decided she wanted to be an astronaut. And then a couple of years later just as I was starting to wonder if things might be shifting for girls of her generation my niece newly adorned in pink dresses and sparkly headbands informed us that she had scrapped her astronaut ambitions altogether. “I want to be a princess” she announced.

“Snow White Belle Aurora… What little girl wouldn’t want to be a Disney princess? Wouldn’t want long flowy hair and wouldn’t want to make a wish in a well and have the perfect life?” asked Anya Dubner a high school student and the teenage daughter of Freakonomics podcast host Stephen Dubner in an October 2019 episode. “What you want is probably because of Disney this fantasy life where everything is so easy and everything is perfect and you find a prince. [But] having your ideal life be so easy to achieve is a really bad message to send to anybody… especially to girls.”

True we’re mostly over the idea of being saved by Prince Charming but vestiges of that narrative still stick stubbornly to our subconscious as girls—and even as fully grown women. While the princess stories have evolved some elements never seem to change. The heroines are still conventionally beautiful with flowing locks and the wide-eyed dewy glow of youth. And it’s still their looks rather than their smarts that tend to draw the attention of men (and often the envy of women). “Pretty” and “princess” are synonymous and evil and ugly are almost inevitably linked in these fairy tales. And while our heroines may be smart adventurous and independent-minded they never have to worry about their income and ultimately end up finding their prince.

Is it any wonder then that so many women spend years building up their hopes instead of building up their wealth?

It’s not just Disney that has perpetuated this fantasy. The fact is if you’re a woman you’ve probably been lied to about wealth and the importance of building it your whole life. But wait you may be thinking hasn’t there been a ton of attention paid in recent years to women and money? Yes. And in particular much has been made of the gender pay gap: that overall women in the United States still earn just 82 cents for every dollar that men do and Black and Latina women earn even less.

But then there’s the gender wealth gap. We don’t spend nearly as much time talking about that. And it is much wider than the pay gap. On average single women in this country have just one-third the net worth that single men do. (“Net worth” meaning the money you have built up in investments savings and your home versus the money you owe.)

Unless something changes that wealth gap is unlikely to close anytime soon. Women are still earning less and setting aside far less for their future than men are. In one recent report from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies nearly half of the women surveyed said they weren’t confident they’d be able to retire comfortably. And with good reason: The center found that women’s median retirement savings amounted to a third of men’s. A 2018 study from Merrill Lynch and the research firm Age Wave estimated that by the time they reach retirement age a man will have made as much as $1 million more in cumulative earnings than a woman.

Maybe a gap like that was OK fifty years ago when the vast majority of households were supported by male breadwinners and one income was enough to provide a comfortable life for a family of four. Back then most Americans could also count on pensions and Social Security to support them in retirement. But that’s not the case anymore. Yet we still aren’t being told or taught to build our incomes and wealth in the same way men are. In fact we’re often discouraged from going after more money.

“Despite the numbers we still believe—and it’s infused in what we teach our children—that men are the breadwinners and for women it’s optional” Marianne Cooper the sociologist at Stanford’s Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab told me. And this assumption that men bear most of the responsibility for earning and investing the money while women are in charge of spending it continues to inform the way parents talk to their sons and daughters about money.

Cooper said even she fell victim initially to the belief. “I considered myself to be financially independent because I was able to take care of myself—I didn’t need a guy to pay the bills or to pick up the check. But I was missing the larger point” she told me. “Being able to take care of yourself today financially isn’t the same thing as being financially independent or financially empowered. Being financially independent means being in a position to take care of yourself for life and to afford the life you want independent of whether you end up sharing it with someone or not.”

Still survey after survey finds parents are more likely to teach their sons core breadwinning skills like how to build credit and invest their money. Girls meanwhile are more likely to be taught how to track their spending and budget.

A Giftcards.com survey found that girls even get less money from their parents with boys in high school and elementary school receiving roughly twenty dollars more on Christmas three dollars more for completing chores and one dollar more for allowance. “Girls are paid less and are taught that they need to save and budget while boys are paid more and taught about investing and credit scores” Bri Godwin a media relations associate for Giftcards.com told Fast Company in 2019.

Is it any surprise then that the gender wage and wealth gaps persist? Or that women end up with less credit less savings and less money invested than men do?

At the heart of this is the fact that even today many parents are still holding on to two deep-rooted beliefs: that their sons will become the main providers for their families and that their daughters will get married. While women are seen as financial contributors who are able to have their own careers we’re still expected to be the ones in charge of managing the household budget (and often the household)—not managing the investments. We’re taught how to budget our money but not how to grow it.

More boys than girls also report that their parents talk with them about setting financial goals. And in an annual survey produced by T. Rowe Price twice as many boys as girls reported having access to credit cards and accompanying lessons on how to use them. The same survey also found that across the board boys feel smarter about money and better prepared for their financial future.

Often this isn’t the result of any conscious decision by parents to withhold credit- and wealth-building advice from their daughters. It’s that we still haven’t wrapped our heads around the idea that these will be essential skills for girls to master in order to succeed as adults.

“ What are women encouraged to invest in? Our wardrobes. ”

Even financial adviser Judith Ward who works at T. Rowe Price worried that she might have talked more about money with her son than with her daughter. “I find myself looking back on the way I talked to them about money matters while they were growing up. Did I inadvertently favor my son over my daughter?” Ward asks in an essay she wrote about the results of her firm’s survey which found that parents are more likely to talk with their sons about financial goals credit and saving. “Should I have talked to both of them more?”

Couple that mixed messaging with the incessant pressure on women to maintain our wardrobes our homes and our appearances and the billions of marketing dollars aimed at encouraging us to spend our hard-earned money to do it and it’s not hard to see why even women who move into higher-paying careers still lag behind men when it comes to saving and investing money for their futures.

Even media created by and for women tends to reinforce these old tropes about budgeting versus investing. A couple of years ago the research firm Age Wave analyzed the money coverage in the most popular women’s magazines. Out of nearly 1600 editorial pages it analyzed guess how many covered financial advice? Five pages. Five! Women’s magazines are full of tips on how to shed ten pounds look ten years younger and pick the perfect little black dress but not how to pick stocks or build an investment portfolio to fund our dreams and our retirement.

When publications that target women do offer money advice the focus is typically on spending less money—not growing more of it. Anne Boden CEO of the British bank Starling commissioned a linguistic study a few years ago of three hundred money-related articles. She found that 90 percent of money articles aimed at women suggested spending less while the majority of those aimed at men focused on investing and building wealth. “Women are told to cut back on coffee to save up for a new pair of shoes” Boden told The New York Times. “With men money is all about power suits and investing and long-term goals.”

What are women encouraged to invest in? Our wardrobes. Google “women’s investment fashion pieces” and you’ll get more than 28 million results including headlines like “30 Investment Pieces Every Working Woman Needs by 30” from Vogue (the first: a $3260 “neutral wool coat”) and Goop’s “Invest Wisely: 10 Classic Pieces That Pay Dividends” (including a $1264 shirt dress). What’s an “investment piece”? It’s basically an addition to your wardrobe that costs the equivalent of your paycheck or more. Outside of a handful of vintage designer bags—which can run anywhere from a couple thousand dollars to more than $40000 (meaning they’re out of budget for many of us)—most items in your wardrobe even designer pieces will typically lose value the longer you own them especially if you’re actually using them.

“ Shifting to a breadwinner mindset is one of the fastest most effective ways to take charge of your finances and your future. ”

Men meanwhile get headlines like “How to Become a Property Millionaire” (Esquire) “How to Make a Million Dollars” (GQ) and “Investing in These Stocks Now Could Make You a Millionaire Retiree” (Fool.com).

It’s not just that women’s magazines and websites don’t offer a lot of advice on investing in stocks and bonds and real estate—assets that are expected to increase in value over time and can provide you with additional income. It’s that the financial advice they do give tends to focus on being able to cover just the basics. Extra goes to little luxuries like new shoes or a girls’ getaway rather than to saving for a house with a walk-in closet to put those shoes in or saving for a future that allows you and your loved ones to travel regularly. We’re encouraged to be ambitious when it comes to our careers. Why not when it comes to our money?

Understanding how millions of us have been conditioned to think about wealth differently than men have—and not in a good way—is key to creating a mindset that will empower you to build wealth like a breadwinner. The truth is most of us need to overwrite a lot of programming we got encoded into us growing up (and even as adults) in order to confidently grow our money.

Imagine instead if you’d been raised to believe you’d be responsible for taking care of yourself financially—and maybe a family too. That you’d been taught how to invest in stocks and bonds and encouraged from a young age to start investing as soon as you got your first paycheck. Imagine if you’d learned how to negotiate everything from a job offer to the best deal on a used car and how to build good credit without sinking into debt. What if by the time you were living on your own you already had a sense of what you’d be earning and what your expenses would cost you? And managing money—and asking for more of it—felt perfectly natural. How would that have affected the choices you made?

Happily it’s never too late to retrain your brain. Whether you’re twenty-two or fifty-two single or married shifting to a breadwinner mindset is one of the fastest most effective ways to take charge of your finances and your future. This is about reprogramming the cultural sabotaging that has been baked into our subconscious early on. It starts with becoming aware of all the messages you’ve already absorbed about breadwinning and then transforming them into beliefs that will propel you toward the life of your dreams.

As spotted by a member of video game message board ResetEra  the hit indie game has been given a 15+ rating by Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee and is reportedly being published by Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive.

Interestingly Hades is currently only available on PC and Nintendo Switch and as at the time of writing there's been no news the game is heading to any other platforms.

So does this confirm Hades is coming to PS4? Not quite. Does it hint that it might be? Yeah probably. For now though all we can do is keep hoping and await official confirmation either way.

ICYMI someone has beaten Hades in seven minutes and 16 seconds . YouTuber Vormie began by purposefully dying and starting an entirely new run where the clock starts ticking as soon as they enter the House of Hades.

From there it's an absolutely breakneck run to the very end of Hades. The player uses the Adamant Rail weapon combined with a lightning-based ability coupled to their attacks to absolutely plow through enemies in split seconds and yes the clock is always ticking throughout the entire run.

""I've played Hades to hell and back (heh) and I still feel that I haven't seen it all"" wrote GR+'s Austin . ""I want to spend more time with Dusa the gorgon housekeeper not to mention the hidden weapon aspects. I have to finish Achilles' arc. I need to pet Cerberus more!

The listing was spotted by users on ResetEra. According to the listing the applicant is Take Two Interactive so the company could be publishing the game for PS4 on behalf of Supergiant Games. If this listing is correct and they usually are we could expect to see Hades pop up on Sony’s consoles relatively soon. Previously the South Korean board has leaked Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered and Fortnite for Switch.

In Hades players take on the role of the Immortal Prince of the Underworld and hack through the roguelite to escape the underworld and the clutches of the titular god. Helping the Prince along the way are Olympus heavyweights Zeus Athena Poseidon and some of the othe gods too. Hades took the gaming world by storm racking up a lot of awards and even beat The Last of Us Part 2 to win Best Game Award at the 2021 BAFTAs. Hades is currently available on PC and Switch with cross save enabled between the platforms. Back in September Jim speculated on whether Supergiant Games’ god tier roguelite would appear on PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It seems that speculation is at least half right for now.

The food price index climbed 0.5% with incremental gains across most categories. The largest increases were reported for pork (+2.4%) and beef & veal (+1.4%).

12-Month Change

Gasoline prices have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The energy index rose 25.1% over the past 12 months boosted by gasoline (+49.6%) and natural gas (+12.1%). High energy prices roused mounting inflation worries throughout the financial markets.

But iOS 14.5 also introduced support for the new Apple AirTag which risks doing the opposite.

For the uninitiated an AirTag is a small device (similar to a Tile) that can be attached to personal items such as keys wallets or luggage. The tag periodically sends messages that can be used to track its location letting you find any lost or missing items with the help of an app.

While clearly useful AirTags can also potentially be misused. Concerns have been raised they might facilitate stalking for example.

And there’s also a more fundamental issue with this technology. Its euphemistic description as a “crowdsourced” way to recover lost items belies the reality of how these items are tracked.

What you won’t find highlighted in the polished marketing statements is the fact that AirTags can only work by tapping into an Apple-operated surveillance network in which millions of us are unwitting participants.

So how exactly do AirTags work?

AirTags are small circular metal discs slightly larger and thicker than an Australian one-dollar coin. Once paired with your Apple ID the tag’s location will be shown in the “Find My” app whenever location data are available.

Apple newsroom

Each tag transmits a unique identifier using Bluetooth. Any compatible Apple device within range (up to 100 metres in ideal conditions) will then relay that identifier to Apple’s servers along with its own location data. The tag’s owner can then log onto the Find My app and access those location details and bingo — you now have a pretty good idea of where your lost bag is.

The AirTags themselves have no positional location capability – they do not contain GPS technology. Rather they merely “ping” the nearest Bluetooth-enabled device and let that device’s location data do the rest.

Besides Bluetooth AirTags also use a relatively new technology called Ultra Wideband. This new feature is supported only by recent Apple devices such as iPhone 11 and 12 and allows for much more precise location tracking.

This precision extends to directional finding – now your phone can literally point you towards the missing tag.

Apple newsroom

While the actual nature of the data transmitted is not too concerning (tag ID and location) what makes it worrying is the sheer scale and number of devices involved. By using an AirTag you are effectively availing yourself of a global monitoring network containing millions and millions of devices.

Everyone’s iPhone (assuming Bluetooth is enabled) is listening for AirTags. When it “hears” one it uploads details of that tag’s identifier and the phone’s location to Apple’s servers.

Besides any privacy concerns this also likely uses small amounts of your data allowance. That’s probably fine most of the time but if you are travelling internationally you might be hit with unexpected charges if you’ve forgotten to disable data roaming.

Stalking technology?

Apple says it has implemented a range of safeguards to detect and prevent attempts to use AirTags for stalking including an alert triggered when an AirTag seems to be accompanying someone who’s not its owner. The alert can appear on the victim’s phone (if they use an iPhone) but can also raise an audible alert on the tag itself. But these measures are relatively easy to circumvent.

One experiment showed a tag can be placed on a person and would not trigger any of the safeguards if reconnected to the stalker’s device regularly enough. This could be done by the victim returning home or within range of their stalker within a three-day window.

More concerningly the alerts can be turned off – which a victim of domestic violence may be coerced into doing by their aggressor. What’s more as AirTags and similar devices become more common we will inevitably encounter more warnings of tags appearing around us. Just like other commonly encountered alerts many users will tire of seeing them and dismiss the prompts.

It is also presumably only a matter of time until these devices are hacked and put to other nefarious purposes.

Apple isn’t the only technology company drawing unwitting users into large networks. Amazon’s SideWalk creates a network that allows your neighbours’ doorbell to connect through your Echo device (if their WiFi doesn’t extend to the front door) effectively sharing your internet connection!

All of this functionality (and the inherent privacy risks) are covered in the standard terms and conditions. That lengthy legalese document we never read allows tech companies to hide behind the claim that we have willingly opted into all this.

Can we opt out?

A simple option to avoid your device acting as a cog in Apple’s machine is to turn off Bluetooth and location services. With Bluetooth disabled your device won’t “see” the beacons coming from AirTags and without location services you can’t report the proximity of the tag.

Of course turning off this functionality means losing useful capabilities such as hands-free kits Bluetooth speakers and satellite navigation and of course makes it harder to find your phone if you lose it.

Ultimately if we want to benefit from the ability to locate missing keys wallets and luggage through AirTags we have to accept that this is only possible through a global network of sensors – even if those sensors are our own phones.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The May 5 crash in Fontana a city 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Los Angeles is also under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The probe is the 29th case involving a Tesla that the federal agency has probed.

In the Fontana crash a 35-year-old man identified as Steven Michael Hendrickson was killed when his Tesla Model 3 struck an overturned semi on a freeway about 2:30 a.m.

Hendrickson was member of the Southern California chapter of a Tesla club who posted numerous photos and video on social media of his white Model 3. One video on his Instagram account showed him riding in the driver’s seat without his hands on the wheel or foot on the pedal as the Tesla navigated freeway traffic. The video included the comment: “Best carpool buddy possible even takes the boring traffic for me.”

A GoFundMe page set up to raise money for his funeral and memorial service says Hendrickson was survived by his wife and two children. A message seeking comment from his wife has not been returned.

“Every time we spoke to him he would light up talking about his kids and loved his Tesla” Tesla Club-SoCal posted on Instagram. “He was truly an amazing human being and will be missed!

Another man was seriously injured when the electric vehicle hit him as he was helping the semi’s driver out of the wreck.

The CHP announced Thursday that its preliminary investigation had determined that the Tesla’s partially automated driving system called Autopilot “was engaged” prior to the crash. The agency said it was commenting on the Fontana crash because of the “high level of interest” about Tesla crashes and because it was “an opportunity to remind the public that driving is a complex task that requires a driver’s full attention.”

However on Friday the agency walked back its previous declaration.

“To clarify” a new CHP statement said “There has not been a final determination made as to what driving mode the Tesla was in or if it was a contributing factor to the crash.”

At least three people have died in previous U.S. crashes involving Autopilot which can keep a car centered in its lane and a safe distance behind vehicles in front of it. Tesla is allowing a limited number of owners to test its self-driving system.

Tesla which has disbanded its public relations department did not respond Friday to an email seeking comment. The company says in owner’s manuals and on its website that both Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” are not fully autonomous and that drivers must pay attention and be ready to intervene at any time.

Autopilot at times has had trouble dealing with stationary objects and traffic crossing in front of Teslas.

In two Florida crashes from 2016 and 2019 cars with Autopilot in use drove beneath crossing tractor-trailers killing the men driving the Teslas. In a 2018 crash in Mountain View California an Apple engineer driving on Autopilot was killed when his Tesla struck a highway barrier.

Tesla’s system which uses cameras radar and short-range sonar also has trouble handling stopped emergency vehicles. Teslas have struck several firetrucks and police vehicles that were stopped on freeways with their flashing emergency lights on.

After the Florida and California fatal crashes the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that Tesla develop a stronger system to ensure drivers are paying attention and that it limit use of Autopilot to highways where it can work effectively. Neither Tesla nor the safety agency took action.

In a Feb. 1 letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt urged the department to enact regulations governing driver-assist systems such as Autopilot as well as testing of autonomous vehicles. NHTSA has relied mainly on voluntary guidelines for the vehicles taking a hands-off approach so it won’t hinder development of new safety technology.

Sumwalt said that Tesla is using people who have bought the cars to test “Full Self-Driving” software on public roads with limited oversight or reporting requirements.

“Because NHTSA has put in place no requirements manufacturers can operate and test vehicles virtually anywhere even if the location exceeds the AV (autonomous vehicle) control system’s limitations” Sumwalt wrote.

He added: “Although Tesla includes a disclaimer that ‘currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous’ NHTSA’s hands-off approach to oversight of AV testing poses a potential risk to motorists and other road users.”

NHTSA which has authority to regulate automated driving systems and seek recalls if necessary seems to have developed a renewed interest in the systems since President Joe Biden took office.

The M3 LR and Performance have had

BT37 the original ~75kwh pana battery

BT38 the ~75kwh lg battery

BT42 the pana ~82kwh battery

BT43 the unknown probably LG ~ 82kwh battery



If you find your car in mytesla and look at the html you’ll find the battery code for your car but roughly..



They were all BT37 when MIA until the last year



When MIC LR started the MIA LR and P changed to BT42 and the MIC LR used the BT38.



There was a delay in MIC M3P (no Q2 deliveries of MIC P cars) until the BT42 battery was available in China. The MIC LR continued with the BT38



Europe have had a mix of MIA and MIC LR cars and following the logic above the MIC have the BT38 battery and consequently smaller capacity and range than the later MIA LR cars. U.K. have never had a 82kwh LR option (although could be about to change) as we switched to MIC before MIA switched to the BT42 battery



They’re now starting to use BT43 in MIC LR at least they’ve been spotted heading to Australia



So there have only been 4 batteries and until a few weeks ago there were only 3.



The SR+ has a different history but again only 3 batteries have been used all of smaller capacity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzY0MzQ2MjgvdGVzbGEtYml0Y29pbi13b250LWFjY2VwdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla No Longer Accepting Bitcoin but a Few U.S. Car Dealers Do,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36434628/tesla-bitcoin-wont-accept/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzY0MzQ2MjgvdGVzbGEtYml0Y29pbi13b250LWFjY2VwdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhb3JhY2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE2LzIwMjEtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS10ZXN0ZWQtb24tdGhlLWdlcm1hbi1hdXRvYmFobi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Tesla Model 3 Performance top speed tested on the German Autobahn,"The review team from AutoTopNL got their hands on a brand new 2021 design refresh Tesla Model 3 Performance and they are testing it rigorously. This is probably from one of the first batches of Model 3 Performance shipped to Europe this year.

In this video review Max from AutoTopNL first went through the face-lift changes that Tesla has made to the exterior and interior to the new Model 3 lineup. Mainly including the new headlights chrome delete of the window trim and side-repeater camera housings the newly designed matte black center console etc.

Most of these changes were first introduced with the launch of the Tesla Model Y in the United States last year.

Performance Brakes

Describing the features of the new Model 3 Performance Max mentions that the car has Brembo brakes but the Tesla online configurator does not specifically mention this brand. Tesla refers to the red colored brake caliper in the Model 3 Performance as “Performance Brakes” they also have a Tesla logo printed on them instead of the Brembo one.

Top Speed

AutoTopNL put the German Autobahn to the right use to test the top speed of the 2021 Tesla Model 3 Performance. Tesla increased the top speed of the Model 3 Performance from 155 mph (250 km/h) to 162 mph (261 km/h). Interestingly in the following test video the 2021 Model 3 Performance reached the top speed of 262 km/h — 1 km/h above the specs on paper.

In-car music composing with Tesla TRAX

Tesla has not just disrupted the internal combustion car market the in-car entertainment segment has also entered into a new era thanks to the innovation of Elon Musk and his software teams at Tesla.

Besides video games YouTube Netflix and other popular streaming services you can create music with the TRAX app when the car is in PARK or charging at a Supercharger station. In this review video Max created a sick and addictive music loop with this Tesla center touchscreen app.

Handling & Track Mode

Max found the handling of the nimble Tesla Model 3 very useful and precise even at high speeds. For the race tracks Tesla has introduced a special ‘Track Mode’. The latest software update contains Racing and Drifting presets to choose from.

A Track Mode custom settings option is also available for experienced and professional drivers. “Model 3 Performance suspension and chassis are impressive” said Max from AutoTopNL in the following review video.

Its ultimate goal is to make internal combustion engines in cars obsolete and that's bound to upset some people.

EV

The fact the first cars made by the then-emerging company weren't exactly great on all levels - while still offering the bestpowertrain at the time - didn't help particularly in Europe where customers tend to hold build quality in high regards. And we all know that quality wasn't one of Tesla's strong points early on.In fact AutoTopNL's Max says the first time he drove a Tesla felt it was like ""a disposable lighter"". Needless to say he didn't like it which goes to show just how important it is in some markets to offer a well-balanced product instead of just a car with great acceleration and range. People will gladly sacrifice those two for a bit more comfort and perceived quality.Fast-forward to 2021 though and the same Max admits he's impressed by the progress that Tesla made. He says that in his home country the Netherlands you'll see a Model 3 everywhere you look. ""They are like cockroaches"" he says and that sed to irritate him since he felt there were other options people should have considered.After driving the 2021 Tesla Model 3 Performance he gets it. He says the improvement is palpable both in terms of materials used and overall build quality. However it's still the performance that steals the show with an acceleration run prompting him to utter something you're not very likely to hear in other cars: ""Surprised myself there!"".With the regen set to the highest position the throttle pedal is described as an ""on and off switch"". He says that accelerating and lifting off too much can make you physically sick and we see no reason to doubt it. And if that doesn't do it then the tail-happy attitude you get with the drift mode active should more than take care of it though the car remains easy to control in any situation.Since this is an AutoTopNL review we all know what to expect: a top speed run on the Autobahn . Max is always happy to deliver and he's lucky enough to deal with a pretty empty section of the German highway. The Model 3 refuses to go over 161 mph (259 kph) which just happens to be its official top speed as well. However the further the battery drains the lower the vehicle's software sets the top speed cap so it's not actually a fixed number."

Recent violence against Asian Americans terrifies me,"I am a survivor of the Cambodian genocide.

When I came to America as an 8-year-old refugee I knew immediately what it felt like to be seen as the other. We were called derogatory terms walking down the street. We even received phone calls telling us to go back to our country.

Advertisement

I felt like I didn’t belong that I was insignificant and lesser than others. I wouldn’t wish these feelings on anyone. But over time I was also exposed to the incredible kindness and hospitality of many Americans and I was fortunate to experience the American promise of going to college and finding amazing career opportunities.

With the recent rise of hate and violence against Asian Americans the worst parts about my experience coming to America and the deep wounds it left are resurfacing.

The shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead including six people of Asian descent has rocked the Asian community. While the district attorney intends to seek hate crime charges against the shooter these sorts of attacks whether racially motivated or not tap into the deep trauma of being Asian in America.

The history of this trauma can be traced back to Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s who were initially thought to be too weak for the job. When they finally prevailed against these prejudices they were then exploited with low wages punished by abusive supervisors and endured incredibly dangerous working conditions — from landslides to explosions to disease.

In the 20th century we saw the unjust internment of Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Regardless of the time period Asian Americans have been consistently singled out for discrimination in this country.

The COVID-19 pandemic has played no small part in reviving these sentiments as Chinese Americans are once again used as a scapegoat.

Sadly Asian Americans are forced to take precautions even in Dallas. I’ve had to warn my parents about simply leaving the house. I’m choosing the treadmill instead of running outside. We are cautioning our children to be watchful and to always be with somebody.

The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism in California has documented a 164% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in 16 of America’s largest cities. For those of us who have experienced bias discrimination and racism firsthand these numbers are terrifying but not surprising.

Even small racially motivated incidents like one I had at the grocery store recently can bring those feelings of otherness back to the surface. A micro-aggressive butcher singled me out for an extra charge to trim salmon fillets for which the store has never charged customers according to a store manager I consulted after the episode. A wound here a wound there. The daily confrontations add up.

Yes this is the America we live in and I am confident that what is broken can be repaired.

I learned early in life that you have to stand up for your worth and the worth of others. Through conscious collective action we can repair this nation and make it more welcoming — and safer — for everyone.

That is why I am on the board of the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum where every visitor is taught the lessons of the Holocaust and other genocides and what it means to be an upstander for those who have no one to stand up for them.

We teach visitors at the museum that an upstander is someone who combats prejudice hatred and indifference. When upstanders see something wrong they work to make it right.

Every day I see more people speaking out against prejudice hatred and indifference. More teens and adults are recognizing their own unconscious bias against others and choosing to transform the way they interact with the world. Is this happening among people you know? If not you can be part of the solution.

While I believe we should all support tougher penalties for hate crimes we must also focus on changing hearts and attitudes. New and effective legislation and tougher penalties may help curtail mass shootings like the ones in Atlanta or El Paso but only changed hearts can fully prevent them.

That is why I’m grateful to the Texas Instruments Foundation for its recent financial gift to support the museum’s programming to confront anti-Asian hate and bigotry. The gift will fund programs through 2022 including our “Voices of Asian Americans” event on May 20 and next year’s “Crucial Conversations: Confronting Anti-Asian American Hate Speech and Hate Crimes” — two in a series of special events that will provide space for personal testimony of racism from Asian American and Pacific Islander voices and education about the work that needs to be done.

Now is the time to remain steadfast united and hopeful because we have the resources right here in Dallas to impact attitudes confront bigotry and make the United States a better place for everyone.

S&P 500 semiconductor stocks trade at an average of 19x 2022 price-to-earnings (P/E) estimates nearly 20% below the S&P 500 Industrials despite free cash flow (FCF) margins 1500-2000 basis points (bps) above and 400-500 bp faster sales growth than the industrials according to a May 11 BoA Global Research note. Semiconductor stocks share attributes with high-quality industrials with the current relative weakness in semiconductor stocks indicated by the SOX index vs. industrials (XLI) showing market rotation rather than trading based on fundamentals BoA reported.

The investment firm opined that semiconductor stocks are not expensive since SPX industrials are trading at 27x 2021 estimated P/E vs. just 21x from semiconductor stocks despite the latter generating 29% FCF margins or 2.4x that of industrials at 12% FCF. Plus the impact of the ongoing chip shortage is not limited to semiconductor stocks since it extends to their industrial and auto customers that are disproportionately impacted in the current cycle BoA noted.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Aided by 5G Broadband and U.S. Chip Making

Similar to industrial stocks semiconductor companies benefit from U.S. infrastructure stimulus in 5G broadband and domestic chip manufacturing. While double-ordering risks exist in semiconductor stocks they are offset by “solid visibility” that is driven by non-cancellable orders product customization and broad-based demand BoA concluded.

Not to be overlooked is the recent upside in gross margins signaling that semiconductor companies are “very effective” in passing along rising input costs to turn inflation into a positive driver for the sector BoA noted. As a result the SOX index has benefitted from rising rates historically.

“Over the past five years chip stocks have been among the best-performing NASDAQ stocks with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) up 4X while the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) is up 3X” said Hilary Kramer who hosts the nationally aired “Millionaire Maker” radio program and heads the GameChangers and Value Authority advisory services.

Kramer wrote to her Value Authority subscribers on May 11 that she expects value stocks to keep outperforming growth stocks but suggested “a rest” would be overdue and healthy for the market.

The six best semiconductor stocks to buy now are trading at over 20X earnings estimates suggesting the market growth will last beyond 2022 Kramer commented. But it is interesting to note that even with the recent chip shortage semiconductor stocks have not performed well since early April.

Overall risk-reward characteristics of the semiconductor stocks is “not great” but it can be said about the NASDAQ as well Kramer counseled. End markets and earnings should be healthy if the economy remains firm she added.

Applied Materials Ranks First Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

The top recommendation of BoA among the six semiconductor stocks to buy is Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) a Santa Clara California-based provider of materials engineering for computer chips and advanced displays. BoA’s price objective of $170 for AMAT is based on 25x 2022 estimated earnings per share (EPS) above the high end of a historical range of 8x-23x but in line with the 1x-2x historical discount to more profitable peers.

Potential catalysts for AMAT’s share price include longer-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity lift semiconductor equipment sales and boost market share. Downside risks to the price target for AMAT could come from a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity upgrades market share loss in key segments merger & integrations risk and macro-economic headwinds BoA noted.

AMAT and two other large U.S.-based semiconductor vendors — Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) a Fremont California-based provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to help chipmakers build smaller and faster electronic devices and KLA Corp. (NASDAQ:KLAC) a semiconductor capital equipment company in Milpitas California trade at 20x average forward P/E. That P/E is two turns below the broad market despite solid multi-year visibility strong balance sheets and potential double-digit-percentage sales and EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next 3-5 years BoA noted.

Lam Research Ranks Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

BoA gave Lam Research a $725 price target based on 20x cash adjusted 2022E P/E within the stock’s historical range of 8x-24x and based on LRCX’s 20%-plus EPS growth rate. Amid a multi-year wafer fabrication equipment growth cycle LRCX is well positioned to benefit the investment firm wrote.

Potential upside catalysts to LRCX’s price objective are stronger-than-expected electronics demand that would tighten semiconductor capacity increased semiconductor equipment sales and improved market share. Downside risks are a slower-than-expected capital spending cycle a delay in memory capacity additions and a market share loss.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Include U.S.-based KLA Corp.

KLA Corp. gained a $400 price objective from BoA based on 22x 2022E P/E within KLAC’s historical range of 10x-26x. The investment firm envisions KLAC as a key enabler of semiconductor manufacturing technology offering a less cyclical topline industry leading profit margins and best-in-class shareholder returns.

Risks to BoA’s price objective for KLAC are the cyclical nature of semiconductor capital spending and its impact on earnings as well as competitive price and market share issues particularly against Applied Materials. Another vulnerability would occur if trouble arose in bringing new products and technologies to market BoA cautioned.

Nova Measuring Instruments Gets Berth as One of Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI) a Rehovot Israel-based provider of metrology devices for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing received a $108 price objective from BoA based on 34x a 2022 estimated non-GAAP EPS that includes stock compensation and adjustments for net cash. The valuation is within its peer range of 20x-40x and is justified BoA noted due to Nova’s superior gross margin profile and its potential to outgrow the market in the next three years.

Downside risks for the stock could include an inability to earn share in new X-Ray metrology market stiff competition from large rivals such as KLA Corp. and historically cyclical semiconductor capital spending. Nonetheless BoA lists NVMI among the six best semiconductor stocks.

Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now Feature Teradyne

Another of the six best semiconductor stocks to buy now is Teradyne Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) a North Reading Massachusetts-based maker of automatic test equipment. BoA’s $155 price objective on TER is based on 25x P/E applied to a fiscal year 2022 estimated Non-GAAP EPS.

The expected P/E is at the high end of Teradyne’s long-term trading range of 12x-26x given TER’s recent and unique exposure to 5G/automation cyclical recovery in auto and industrial markets and market share gains in core semiconductor testing. Downside risks to the investment firm’s price objective are cyclicality and potential loss of market share in the core semiconductor test market along with increasing competition in the robotics segment BoA cautioned.

NVDA Gains Place Among Six Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now

A BoA buy recommendation NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara California-based designer of graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. BoA highlighted trends at top cloud picks and noted NVDA showed solid data center visibility at its recent analyst day with 2021 forecast to be a strong year with year-to-year growth of about 30%.

In addition BoA described NVDA as having momentum that could accelerate after its introduction of its Grace-Arm-based server processor in 2023 that will be focused on the Giant AI/HPC portion of the market. NVDA is positioned to take advantage of its scale data center presence and complementary silicon (GPU and DPU) as well as its software and development ecosystem BoA added.

Further easing of cloud digestion and positive capital expenditure upside positive for NVDA led BoA to give the stock a $700 price target based on 44x 2022 estimated P/E excluding cash at the higher-end of NVDA’s historical 20x-54x P/E range showing NVIDIA’s superior long-term growth profile in large underpenetrated markets according to BoA.

Risks to achieving BoA’s price objective include NVDA’s exposure to the personal computer market competition in accelerated computing markets and among auto vendors “lumpy and unpredictable sales” in new enterprise data center and auto markets potential reduced capital returns possible auto sales slowdown until advance driver-assistance systems (ADAS) become more meaningful and increased operational expenditures.

Semiconductor ETF Appeals to Pension Fund Chairman

“The semiconductor industry is going through major changes that are related more to politics and national security than technology” said Bob Carlson chairman of the Board of Trustees of Virginia’s Fairfax County Employees’ Retirement System with more than $4 billion in assets. “Asian companies have dominated the industry for a while. But the United States is concerned about national security competition with China and supply chain problems. A heavy dependence on Asian semiconductor manufacturers presents the potential for geopolitical tensions to trigger restrictions on semiconductor supply.”

The semiconductor stocks are down from their highs due to these concerns combined with revenue and earnings declines that are likely to be caused by the global semiconductor shortage said Carlson who also leads the Retirement Watch investment newsletter. It is a good time to invest in the stocks particularly with a diversified portfolio through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as his choice of Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (NYSE Arca:PSI).

The California-based company which also produced some very fine audio electronics and planar-magnetic headphones could see the writing on the wall: streaming video was the future and disc-spinning was the past. Oppo’s Chinese parent company must have concluded (correctly we must admit) that there was more money to be made selling mainstream consumer electronics such as the Oppo-branded smartphones and smart watches that are still being built mostly for the Asian market. In early 2019 Samsung followed suit exiting the disc-player market. At that time high-end players were still being offered by Panasonic Pioneer and Sony but none could match the discontinued Oppo players’ combination of high performance excellent build-quality extensive features and overall value. In the last couple of years most of the large electronics companies have chosen not to refresh their lineups of disc-players at all focusing instead on TVs gaming consoles and mobile devices. For the average Joe the quality of picture and sound available via streaming is more than good enough. And indeed streaming quality has improved significantly in the last several years. But AV enthusiasts know that the very best home-theater experiences are still encoded in the microscopic pits and lands of the Ultra HD Blu-ray disc. And it is with these enthusiasts in mind that a new company called Reavon has entered the scene with its first two products the UBR-X100 and UBR-X200 both of which are UHD Blu-ray players boasting high-end performance and a noticeably Oppo-like appearance. Is there a new Oppo in town?

Aesthetic similarities aside there are reasons for the references to Oppo. Like Oppo Digital Reavon is a small company owned by a larger organization (in this case it’s the French consumer electronics company Groupe Archisoft) seemingly founded with one goal in mind: to build the best disc-spinners for discerning enthusiast customers. And while Oppo invested millions to co-develop a custom SoC (System on Chip) with chip manufacturer MediaTek the Reavon players use MediaTek’s most advanced “off-the-shelf” SoC the MTK8581. This chip is a highly integrated multi-media SoC that handles 4K-UHD playback and upscaling. Like Oppo’s customized SoC the 8581 utilizes a quad-core 64-bit processor — an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cluster running at 1.3GHz — along with an ARM Mali-T860 MP2 graphics processor. (If I remember correctly the MTK8581 also can be found in Pioneer’s $1100 UDP-LX500 player which is an excellent performer.) Oppo fans will recall that the company offered a two-player lineup with identical video capabilities in both units. The pricier UDP-205 produced exactly the same images as the more affordable UDP-203 but it offered audiophile-quality DACs and a custom analog output stage. The two new players from Reavon follow a similar model. If you need analog outputs the UBR-X200 will be for you. But if you only plan to connect your player via HDMI the UBR-X100 is just as good a digital transport as its more expensive sibling. It simply lacks DACs and analog audio circuity altogether. Speaking of prices surely you must be wondering how much these new players will cost. Well so am I. When I reached out to Reavon for some answers I was told that the products are still under development and that more information would become available at an unspecified later date. Will the players even be sold in the US? And if so how much will they cost? We simply don’t know yet. But the UBR-X100 and UBR-X200 are both slated to launch this summer in Europe where they will sell for €800 and €1600 respectively. (That comes to about $945 for the UBR-X100 and about $1890 for the UBR-X200 though it’s worth pointing out that retail prices don’t always translate proportionally from one market to another). For the sake of comparison Oppo’s UDP-203 sold for $550 in 2018 while the flagship UDP-205 would set you back $1300.

We do know that both players will support Dolby Atmos and DTS:X along with HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR. No mention is made of HDR10+ support. Both offer dual HDMI outputs; one delivers the standard audio/video combo while the other is an audio-only path that reportedly carries a higher-quality audio signal. Like the Oppo players the Reavons are “universal disc players” meaning they will also play CDs and SACDs along with DVDs standard Blu-rays and UHD Blu-ray discs. Users can play back multimedia files from external USB drives or from DLNA/Samba local network storage. But Reavon users may have to rely on an Ethernet cable for network connectivity; WiFi is not yet on the features list. (The Oppo players featured built-in WiFi for those keeping score at home.) Of the two Reavon players only the more expensive UBR-X200 includes an RS-232C terminal for custom AV integration. It also offers 7.1-channel analog outputs along with both balanced and unbalanced stereo analog outs. Both Reavon players promise ultra-robust construction. The 1.6-mm-thick chassis base is attached to a 3-mm-thick steel plate which provides mechanical reinforcement and a low center of gravity. This stiffer and more stable chassis structure minimizes the potentially deleterious effects of mechanical movement coming from the disc drive according to Reavon. (Interestingly when I was double-checking the retail price of Pioneer’s UDP-LX500 I noticed mention of the same 1.6-mm-thick chassis base and 3-mm-thick steel plate.) Weighing in at 15 lbs the Reavon UBR-X200 is no featherweight for a disc-spinner and some of that heft can be attributed to the “military engineering class” toroidal transformer that sits at the heart of the unit’s power supply. Still Oppo’s UDP-205 was even chunkier at 22 lbs. The Reavon’s other main audiophile consideration is the use of Burr-Brown Audio PCM1690 DACs. Built by Texas Instruments these 24-bit Delta-Sigma chips offer differential outputs and can process 8-channels of audio each with an advertised signal-to-noise ratio of 113dB. The UBR-X200 also employs “custom audiophile capacitors” a “jitter-free clock” and a high-quality main circuit board according to Reavon.

Did OPPO Set the Bar Too High for Others To Follow?

There are still many questions surrounding Reavon and its new UHD players. The comparisons with Oppo are perhaps inevitable and it’s no secret that many enthusiasts who never got around to buying a UDP-205 have been kicking themselves since 2018. (Don’t believe me? Try to find a used one selling for less than $3K. I’ll wait.) But Oppo left some very big shoes to fill. While Reavon might succeed in producing well-built high-performance players the company hasn’t yet promised a feature-set on par with what Oppo offered. In addition to the aforementioned built-in WiFi the Oppo players eventually became Roon-ready. Roon users could painlessly and wirelessly send music from their favorite streaming services — or from their own music libraries — directly to their Oppo players allowing them to take advantage of the dual ESS 9038PRO Sabre DACs in all their glory. Or thanks to the USB input the UDP-205 could be used as a USB DAC complete with MQA certification. Coaxial and optical digital inputs meant that smart TVs or legacy audio products could benefit from an Oppo’s superior DACs as well. Meanwhile an HDMI 2.0 input allowed the user to connect another video source such as a cable box or streaming device and take advantage of Oppo’s superb video processing. And if you wanted to watch a movie or listen to music late at night the UDP-205’s built-in headphone jack was surprisingly capable of powering many high-end headphones to a satisfying level. The Reavon players do not have a headphone jack an HDMI input a USB input a coax input nor an optical input. As of now they seem to offer no audio streaming capabilities whatsoever which seems like a waste when you consider how much money and engineering must have gone toward the audio performance of the step-up UBR-X200 model. Some might argue that these features aren’t necessary in a high-end Blu-ray player and it’s certainly true that a product needn’t be all things to all people in order to be successful. Many high-end audio products seem to benefit from stripping away unneeded features in order to focus on performance. (Compare for example the features list of a typical AVR to that of a high-end 2-channel integrated amp.) But the fact remains that the Oppo players did offer all of these features along with superb performance excellent build-quality and (in my experience) great customer service. And on top of that they were less expensive than these new Reavon players at least based on the European launch prices. Now I don’t mean to suggest that AV enthusiasts shouldn’t be excited about Reavon’s arrival. I am thrilled to see a new company dedicated to physical media especially at a time when most of the major brands have either backed out completely or allowed their players from a few years ago to “mature” on store shelves. I just think that Oppo set the bar very high in the niche market of high-end Blu-ray players and that Reavon — or anyone else — will need a heck of a running start in order to reach it.

French company Reavon is developing a pair of conspicuously Oppo-like UHD Blu-ray players. The UBR-X100 (€800) and UBR-X200 (€1600) are slated to arrive in Europe soon! Will they be the next OPPO? Buy Now Thank you for supporting Audioholics by purchasing from our Affiliates.

The light armored vehicle (LAV) is not a ""tank"" exactly -- but since its introduction in 1983 General Dynamics (GD 0.85%) and its predecessor companies have sold more than 10000 around the world. That's about as many Light Armored Vehicles as it's sold Abrams main battle tanks. At recent prices running to $4.3 million apiece the LAV has evolved into a multibillion-dollar franchise for the giant defense contractor.

But now it's at risk.

Tanks for the memories LAV

In 2019 the U.S. Marine Corps the original buyer of the LAV announced a project to replace the Corps' venerable armored vehicle with a new ""modern Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle ... highly mobile networked transportable protected and lethal"" aiming to begin the switchover in the late 2020s.

As the legacy provider General Dynamics was quickly tapped to offer a prototype ARV to replace the Marine Corps' fleet of 600 LAV-25s last year. BAE Systems which manufactures the Marine Corps' Amphibious Combat Vehicle is also expected to bid. SAIC (SAIC 1.18%) entered the competition in 2019 but has since dropped out.

General Dynamics' toughest competition of all however for the upcoming ARV contract may come from a joint bid by rival U.S. armor-maker Textron (TXT 1.27%) and its Israeli partner Elbit Systems (ESLT -0.84%). Last week the two companies jointly announced plans to offer the U.S. Marine Corps a ""transformational"" light tank by the name of ""Cottonmouth"" to serve as the new ARV.

Introducing the Cottonmouth

Technical specifications of Textron's prototype have not been released. But images of the Cottonmouth prototype show it to be an amphibious six-wheeled low-profile armored vehicle equipped with an anti-tank missile launcher and a remotely operated gun system. To meet USMC requirements the Cottonmouth would need to weigh no more than 18.5 tons so that a single ""Ship-to-Shore Connector"" (a large hovercraft) could carry four ARVs at a time from an amphibious warship to assault a beach.

Inside the Cottonmouth will feature ""360° Situational Awareness"" from Elbit utilizing external cameras to display the vehicle's surroundings inside on crew workstations and on individual ""IronVision Helmet Mounted Displays."" With this tech the ARV's crew will be able to effectively ""see through"" the ARV's armor in all directions.

What it means to General Dynamics ... and to Textron

Winning the ARV competition would be big business for any company -- but for Textron especially.

Consider that analysts estimate that an ARV contract could yield sales of $1.8 billion to $6.8 billion over five years to the winner depending on the prices the competitors bid. If accurate this implies a unit cost of $3.6 million to $13.6 million on the estimated 500 ARVs that the USMC would require.

That's quite a lot considering that General Dynamics is still selling LAVs for about $4.3 million. In theory General Dynamics could make even more money selling the USMC 500 ARVs than it's made already selling them 600 LAVs. And according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence General Dynamics' Combat Systems division which builds the LAV and would build the ARV is General Dynamics' most profitable division boasting an operating profit margin of 14.4% on its sales. For its part Textron earns only 11.6% profit margins at its smaller Textron Systems business which would be responsible for Cottonmouth production. (And Elbit's operating margin is even smaller -- just 7% for the entire company).

If the ARV contract ends up being worth $6.8 billion that would still be less than one year's Combat Systems sales for giant General Dynamics which booked $7.2 billion in sales last year -- moving the needle for giant GD but perhaps not by much. $6.8 billion for Textron on the other hand would be more money than its tiny Textron Systems division generates in over five years of work. For Elbit a $6.8 billion contract would be more money than the entire company makes in a year.

A win on ARV for General Dynamics therefore would be welcome news and help maintain the profitability of what is currently General Dynamics' most profitable division. A win for Textron and Elbit on the other hand could transform each of those companies into vastly more profitable businesses for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“What the town’s looking to do is be the location for the next generation of jobs in terms of the life sciences biotechnology clean industry you know the jobs of the future and clearly here is an active provider in that industry” said Town Manager Paul Cohen.

Although the company already has a 60000-square-foot non-manufacturing facility at 22 Alpha Road and a manufacturing facility in Bedford the expansion into this 113000-square-foot space at 220 Mill Road will allow the company to ramp up production.

“We’re experiencing unprecedented demand for our products right now. That’s in support of COVID-19 but it’s also in support of a lot of life-saving life-sustaining therapies as well” said Brandon Pence vice president and general manager of the company’s purification and pharma analytics business. “For us to maintain our ability to supply those quickly to our customers we needed expanded sites.”

Once the new facility is operating Thermo Fisher Scientific will have tripled its manufacturing capacity.

Pence said that after a global search for the new site location the company landed on Chelmsford in March 2020 for two primary reasons: proximity to the Bedford site and the existing Mill Road building that “lends itself very well to what we need from a manufacturing footprint” he said. He added that the town was a good fit because “it’s a great corridor of bioprocessing and biotech.”

The project was likely facilitated by a decision a few years ago to expand the zoning definition of research and development to specifically include biotech and bioscience according to Chelmsford Community Development Director Evan Belansky. Chelmsford was also recently designated as a Platinum “BioReady” community the highest designation by MassBio due to its modernized zoning bylaws expedited permitting processes and accessible infrastructure.

Chelmsford Business Development Director Lisa Marrone called the project “a perfect example of what we’ve been working towards with our zoning and our permitting” she said. “We’re just so thrilled to have that project happening at a time when we’re really trying to push for modern technology in our empty spaces.”

The Mill Road site will manufacture chromatography resins used to purify biologic medicines which are “extracted from semi-synthesized by or manufactured in living organisms” according to IMMpress Magazine. These resins also purify vaccines including mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Pence explained how chromatography resins work. Their surface chemistry allows them to bind to particular molecules which then allows users to wash out impurities from the drug or vaccine. Once that happens the drug or vaccine “(goes) through a number of other downstream processes that purify it into the form that gets injected or taken in the customers that we serve” he said.

Because this process is so rigorous the company’s customers which include “basically every major pharma company or biotech company” according to Pence “will require pretty exhaustive qualification documentation to show that a new site is equivalent to the prior site.” This means the company will spend months demonstrating that the site meets clients’ quality standards. Pence declined to name specific clients Thermo Fisher Scientific works with.

Although its expansion was planned before the pandemic picked up worldwide its technology was already in place to aid in the vaccination effort. “What’s happened in the course of a year might have otherwise taken seven to 10 years” Pence said. “The fact that it took off as quickly as it did is just one of those unique things that came from the pandemic but for us it didn’t require us to alter our manufacturing process. We had a technology that was already in play and we were able to respond quickly for our customers.”

Thermo Fisher Scientific is already hiring for roles at the new facility including operations quality and manufacturing engineering. The company is working with UMass Lowell particularly its chemistry and chemical engineering departments on its recruitment efforts. Open jobs listed at https://jobs.thermofisher.com include those for applicants with a variety of educational backgrounds. Roles in other departments including marketing product management and research & development will likely be available at that site down the road as the business grows. Many of those teams are in Bedford. Pence estimates that the company will hire about 100 new employees ahead of its January 2022 phase 1 opening with more in phases 2 and 3.

“These are the types of jobs that communities love. They’re well-paying jobs it’s a productive use in terms of (benefit) to society” Cohen said. “We’re really thrilled that Thermo Fisher has expanded into the facility in Chelmsford.”

Pence agreed. “It’s a fun thing to do” he said. “I can walk away from my day and know that I’ve been involved in some pretty cool technology that’s helping to make the world healthier.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDIwLTAyMS0wMDUwMC010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Long noncoding RNA LYPLAL1-AS1 regulates adipogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells by ...,"Preparation of clinical adipose specimens and isolation culture and differentiation of hAMSCs

hAMSCs and hAMSC-derived RNA were obtained from human adipose tissue from patients undergoing liposuction according to procedures approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College.

Human adipose samples were each incubated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Waltham MA USA) for total RNA extraction. The isolated RNA was stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis of lncRNA and adipogenic-associated gene expression (the specific RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) procedure were described below.)

hAMSCs were isolated from human adipose tissue and cultured according to our previous studies555657. Briefly adipose tissue was washed twice with D-Hanks’ buffer containing penicillin–streptomycin and centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min. The wash solution was discarded and 0.2% collagenase P (Sigma-Aldrich USA) was added to the adipose tissue at a ratio of 3:1 adipose volume/collagenase P solution and the samples were digested at 37 °C on a shaking table for 20–30 min until no obvious lumps were remaining. The digested product was diluted in D-Hanks’ buffer and filtered through a 100-μm sieve to remove any undigested tissue. Additional D-Hanks’ buffer was added to the adipose tissue filtrate to a final volume of 50 ml and the solution was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. This step was repeated two more times to wash away the blood cells and collagenase P. Cells were then cultured in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 (Corning USA) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco Grand Island NY USA) 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor bb (Sigma-Aldrich) 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich) 10–4 M ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) 10–8 M dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) 10–9 M insulin transferrin selenium (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (both from Gibco) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . The culture medium was replaced every 2–3 days and cells were passaged at 90% confluency. Cells at passages 3−5 were used in the following experiments.

For adipogenic differentiation hAMSCs at passage 3 were exposed to adipogenic differentiation medium consisting of high glucose-DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) 1 µM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) as described21. Adipogenic differentiation efficiency was determined by oil red O (Sigma-Aldrich) staining.

hAMSCs were induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation in H-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco Carlsbad CA USA) 10 mM β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) 0.5 mM l-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01 mM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) as described27.

Flow cytometry

hAMSCs at passage 3 were harvested and washed twice using D-Hanks’ buffer and then were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies against CD29 CD73 CD44 CD90 CD105 CD206 CD34 CD45 CD106 and HLA-DR (BD Biosciences) or isotype control antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were then washed twice and filtered through a 400-mesh sieve before being analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with CFlow Plus software (BD Biosciences).

Microarray analysis

To identify adipogenic differentiation-related lncRNAs hAMSCs were induced to undergo adipogenic differentiation as described above and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen USA) on days 0 and 9. hAMSCs from three donors were analyzed in this study. Sample processing and hybridization were conducted by Cnkingbio Biotechnology (Beijing China) with Affymetrix mRNA and lncRNA microarray chips. To find differentially expressed lncRNAs we compared lncRNA expression from each sample before versus after adipogenic differentiation (day 0 versus day 9) with the following cut-off criteria: fold change ≥ 2 expression value ≥ 3 and P value < 0.05.

Oil red O staining

Adipogenic differentiation cells at 8–10 days in culture were washed twice with D-Hanks’ solution and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed three times with D-Hanks’ solution and stained with filtered oil red O solution (Sigma-Aldrich USA) (stock solution: 3 mg/ml in isopropanol; working solution: 60% oil red O stock solution and 40% distilled water) for 30 min at 37 °C. After staining the cells were washed under flowing water for 1 min and then visualized and imaged by light microscopy. To quantify the dying cells the oil red O staining was extracted by isopropanol and the OD value was measured at 570 nm by a microplate reader.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red staining

ALP staining was performed using the ALP Staining Kit (Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Tianjin China). Alizarin red staining was performed to detect matrix mineralization deposition during the later stage of osteogenesis as described27. In brief cells in culture were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed with distilled water and stained with 1% Alizarin red (Leagene Beijing China) for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were washed with distilled water to remove the unbound dye and matrix calcification was visualized as red deposits under light microscopy.

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or fresh adipose tissue by TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then reverse transcription of 2 µg RNA from each sample was performed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Japan) in a total volume of 30 µl. Quantitative PCR was then carried out using the QuantStudio™ Design & Analysis System (ABI USA) with the SYBR-Green Master mix (Yeasen Shanghai China). The relative RNA levels were normalized to GAPDH expression using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primer sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Western blot analysis

Protein was extracted from cultured cells by RIPA lysis buffer (Yeasen Shanghai) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (1:100; Beyotime China) and quantified with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). Protein lysates were separated on 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.22 μm; Millipore Danvers MA USA). Then western blotting was carried out. In brief the membranes were blocked with 5% milk at room temperature for 1 h incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000; Yeasen Shanghai) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected by ECL reagent (Millipore). The results were obtained using a Tanon imager (Tanon Shanghai China). The primary antibodies used were as follows: PPARγ antibody (1:1000; Abcam) AP2 antibody (1:1000; Abcam) LPL antibody (1:1000; Abcam) CEBPα antibody (1:1000; Abcam) DSP antibody (25318-1-AP 1:500; Proteintech Wuhan China) β-catenin antibody (51067-2-AP 1:1000; Proteintech) GAPDH antibody (10494-1-AP 1:10000; Proteintech) and HRP-labeled ACTB antibody (1:10000; Proteintech).

siRNAs ASOs and lentivirus infection

siRNAs and ASOs used to knock down LYPLAL1-AS1 and the corresponding controls were purchased from Shanghai GeneBio (Shanghai China) and siRNAs specific for DSP and the corresponding controls were purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou China). All siRNAs and ASOs were transfected into hAMSCs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technology USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations; the final siRNA or ASOs concentration used was 50 nM.

For overexpression the full-length sequence of LYPLAL1-AS1 was inserted into the LV5-EF1-a-EGFP-Puro lentivirus expression vector and packaged by GenePharma (Shanghai China) and a lentiviral vector that expressed scrambled RNA was used as the negative control. hAMSCs were infected with viral precipitates at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and stable cell lines were established by puromycin treatment

Subcellular fractionation

The separation of nuclear and cytosolic fractions was performed using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was extracted and qRT-PCR was performed to assess the relative proportion in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions.

FISH assay and colocalization of lncRNA with protein

FISH was performed using an RNA FISH Kit (RiboBio Guangzhou China). In brief hAMSCs cultured on coverslips were rinsed in PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. Then the cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 5 min washed three times and prehybridized at 37 °C for 30 min. Then anti-LYPLAL1-AS1 anti-U6 or anti-18S oligodeoxynucleotide probes (designed and made by RiboBio Guangzhou China) diluted in hybridization solution were incubated with the cells in the dark at 37 °C overnight. The next day the cells were stained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Germany).

For immunofluorescence colocalization of lncRNA and protein cells were fixed and permeabilized and in situ hybridization with the LYPLAL1-AS1 oligodeoxynucleotide probe was carried out as described above. After that the cell chamber was incubated with anti-DSP (1:50 25318-1-AP; Proteintech) overnight at 4 °C. The next day after being washed three times with PBS the sample was incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 1 h washed with PBS and then incubated with DAPI for 5 min to dye the nuclei. The cells were imaged as described above.

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends

RNA ligase-mediated RACE (RLM-RACE) was carried out with total RNA extracted from primary hAMSC cultures and was used to determine the transcription start site and the size of the LYPLAL1-AS1 transcript. 5′ and 3′ RACE was carried out using a FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA). Because of the low copy number of LYPLAL1-AS1 transcripts in cells nested PCR was performed for each reaction. The primers used for the nested PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

ChIRP-MS assay

hAMSCs were subjected to a ChIRP assay as described58. In brief we carried out the following steps: (1) antisense RNA probes were designed to bind every 100 bp of the LYPLAL1-AS1 and U1 (positive control) transcripts and the BiotinTEG biotin label was added to the 3′ end of each probe. (2) hAMSCs were cultured as described above and 2 × 107 hAMSCs induced for 3 days of adipogenic differentiation were collected. (3) For cell cross-linking and preservation the cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for RNA–chromatin cross-linking. The samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a −80 °C freezer. (4) Samples were added to lysis buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor PMSF at room temperature. (5) Ultrasonic crushing was performed and the cross-linked protein–RNA complexes were subjected to sonication. The lysate was checked every 30 min and sonication continued until the cell lysate was no longer turbid. At this point the DNA was broken into 100- to 500-bp fragments. (6) Hybridization of the cell lysate with biotinylated RNA probes (designed and synthesized by Aksomics Shanghai China) was then performed for ChIRP enrichment. (7) The extraction and subsequent analysis of RNA DNA and nucleic acid-binding proteins were carried out. The RNA isolated by ChIRP was extracted for qRT-PCR detection to confirm that the lncRNA molecule was a specific enrichment target and GAPDH was used as a control. (8) Subsequent proteomics analyses were performed by Aksomics (Shanghai China).

RIP assay

A RIP assay was performed with the EZ-Magna RIP Kit (Millipore). Anti-DSP was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz CA USA). RNAs that co-precipitated with DSP were extracted with TRIzol reagent and LYPLAL1-AS1 enrichment was examined using qRT-PCR as we described above. Enrichment associated with normal rabbit IgG (Millipore) served as the control.

De novo adipogenesis assay

This animal experiment was performed with approval by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College. We purchased 6-week-old NOD/SCID nude mice from SPF Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Beijing China). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions for 2 weeks before the experiment was carried out. Three mice were randomly allocated to the LYPLAL1-AS1-overexpressing group and the control group. Specifically 2 × 106 hAMSCs induced for 3 days of adipogenic differentiation were suspended in 100 μL of adipogenic medium mixed with 100 μL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) on ice and immediately injected subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of the mouse as we indicated in Fig S3a. Eight weeks later each mouse was sacrificed and the de novo adipose mass was removed. Each adipose mass was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 μm thick) for subsequent H&E staining and analysis.

Immunohistochemical staining

Briefly adipose mass was fixed in 4% PFA dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution and embedded in OCT. Samples were then sectioned (10-μm-thick sections) and incubated with GFP antibody (1:100 Servicebio Wuhan China) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 Servicebio Wuhan China) at room temperature for 1 h away from light. Cells were then visualized and imaged using a microscope.

That year Singh decided to bet big on malt barley a cereal that is used to manufacture beer. After all Singh was promised a bonus of ₹100 over and above the minimum support price (MSP). The high returns prompted him to take over 30 acres of land on lease. Four months later his hopes came crashing down.

Instead of the promised ₹1625 per quintal Singh sold his harvest to the same agent at a discount of ₹300. It was a take it or leave it offer. Singh did not know who the actual buyer was nor did he have any means to enforce the contract which was verbal. The only evidence he had was a receipt for the seeds that he had purchased from the agent for planting.

Months later he reacted in a way farmers often do—by slashing the area under barley to less than a fifth of the previous year’s acreage. That was the winter of 2020. A similar strategy was adopted by hundreds of other farmers in Rajasthan a leading grower of barley prompting prices to shoot up to ₹1800 per quintal in April this year.

This roller-coaster ride is common to barley a commercial grain that is used as an animal feed and also to manufacture high-value items like beer whiskey and health drinks. Farmers in India grow less than 2 million tonnes of barley in a year—compared to say over 100 million tonnes of wheat. But the vagaries of this minor cereal in a nutshell capture a glaring market failure—the inability of commercial buyers to guarantee remunerative prices to growers or even the semblance of a will to nurture a long-term relationship.

In a way it also goes to show why farmers have such deep distrust toward markets. Growers from the desert state of Rajasthan would rather stick to wheat—which consumes more water and fertiliser—than plant barley. The main reason: wheat prices are steady due to assured government purchases. So farmers sow barley only on land which is severely water-starved and where a crop like wheat is impossible to grow—a phenomenon best described as a Hobson’s choice: apparently a free choice but one without any real alternative.

Last September India passed three new laws to liberalize agriculture markets introduce contract farming and amend the decades-old Essential Commodities Act in order to incentivise post-harvest storage and processing. The objective was to wean farmers away from cereals like rice and wheat where assured minimum support prices distort cropping patterns. On paper the new laws made sense: Why not align cropping patterns with market demand?

However the lived experience of farmers is somewhat different. Commercial farming catering to the market—be it cotton soybean or barley—is dependent on both domestic and international supply-demand dynamics which often results in unstable prices and returns. And too many Indians who don’t have the financial muscle to withstand such risks are still deeply dependant on agriculture for sustenance. This is nowhere more evident than in the barley fields of Rajasthan.

For an industrial grain like barley price fluctuations are so recurrent that even quality-conscious large malt companies desist from writing formal contracts with farmers. Come harvest season if the wholesale prices crash the manufacturers will incur a loss; if market prices shoot up beyond the contracted price farmers can renege too they fear. This is one reason why thousands of farmers who are protesting at Delhi’s doorstep are sceptical about market solutions.

Losing currency

Where Kulwinder Singh sat in his living room a giant framed photograph of the Sikh religious shrine the Golden Temple with its sacred pool made for an arresting backdrop. “If we get water on time we would not be growing barley at all"" said the 65-year-old farmer from a village named 14Q at Ganganagar. The villages in these parts are named after the outlets of an irrigation network that was built way back in the 1920s by Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner following a devastating famine.

Singh explained that while the wheat crop needs five irrigations in a growing season barley can thrive with less than half that volume of water. Wheat yields a little over 10 quintals per bigha (0.6 acre) and barley about 8-9 quintals. Also wheat sells for more than ₹1900 per quintal while barley prices fluctuate between ₹1000-1500 per quintal—making the later a risky proposition on all counts. So for local farmers like Singh the importance of barley has receded into the realm of tradition: having the occasional bejar ki roti—nutritious flatbreads made out of barley and chickpea flour.

Harman Brar Singh’s son who set aside a prestigious management degree in order to take up citrus farming at 14Q noted that the highways leading into Ganganagar are lined with state-of-the-art warehouses but farmers mostly do not have the means to store their grains or to time their sales according to price surges.

“Large commodity trading companies local traders and commission agents dictate prices. We usually have no option but to dump at whatever price is offered since the grain is prone to damage due to pests and moisture"" Brar said.

Brar’s friend at village 2T a young farmer named Jitender Pal Singh was visibly frustrated at the mention of barley. Juban ke pakke he hum (We never go back on our words) Singh said citing the instance of the 2020 harvest when he was promised a price of ₹1625 per quintal for growing seed-grade barley by an agent but was forced to sell at ₹1150 per quintal. “We don’t even know which company we are selling it to. Maybe it is Shaw Wallace or United Breweries (liquor manufacturers) or some seed company. But what I understand is that they don’t buy our harvest. They buy our compulsion.""

The problem with barley is that large buyers like United Breweries often push farmers to grow more and then disappear when the market prices crash (as was the case in 2020 when the first wave of the pandemic hit India) said Swarn Singh manager of a local cooperative society. “Most companies do not want to invest in a long-term relationship with farmers. They are guided by short-term profits which is why they do not enter into formal contracts. The remoteness of Ganganagar where there are no malt units adds to our problem"" he said.

Even when farmers decide to grow barley they prefer to sow low-value feed varieties and not high-value malt ones which are expensive to grow and require more care and irrigation. So 73-year-old Devi Lal Saharan’s only connection to malt barley is the whiskey he sips on some evenings. “I can’t stand beer for it has got no current"" Saharan jokes. He planted a desi (local) variety which is used to make animal feed in 2020; his third year of staying away from malt varieties.

Quality concerns

When I met him last month at the Ganganagar mandi Gurcharan Singh a young farmer and trader had just returned from the farmer’s protest site at Delhi’s border after a month of volunteering with the international charity KhalsaAid. “When there is a shortage the companies buy even feed varieties for malting (as long as a certain weight per thousand grains parameter is met). But in surplus years they create tantrums and refuse to lift the harvest by raising quality concerns"" Singh said.

Overall corporate purchase of malt barley hovers around 300000 tonnes every year close to 20% of India’s barley production.

Singh added that once the new farm laws are implemented—they have been stayed by the Supreme Court for now—and state-regulated mandis weaken (due to zero taxes on trade outside government established wholesale markets) farmers will be left with no choice but to sell their produce to corporations at whatever price is offered.

United Breweries Ltd the largest beer manufacturer in India which procures barley from the farmers of Sri Ganganagar did not respond to queries from Mint.

Water plus taxes

Barley is a unique agricultural commodity where the price of the produce alongside other factors is also driven by taxation. The industry joke is that beer is nothing but water plus taxes (to be sure barley accounts for about 70% of input costs) said Unupom Kausik president at National Collateral Management Services Ltd a leading player in the post-harvest commodity value chain.

“Beer sales were disastrous last year due to the pandemic which was bound to impact farm gate prices... but then beer consumption in India is dismal as consumers prefer hard liquor (which has higher alcohol content) over beer as a value-for-money proposition"" Kausik adds.

Indians on average drink about two litres of beer in a year compared to the over 30 litre per capita consumption in Europe and China.

According to Vikram Chitlangia a Ganganagar-based trader who engages farmers to grow seed-grade barley instability in demand and usage often leads to price fluctuations. For instance over 80% of India’s barley production is used to manufacture animal feed. Since crops like soybean maize and sorghum are also used as animal feed barley prices are often determined by supply-demand dynamics in these competing crops.

Along with prices and acreage under cultivation barley production fluctuates too: from 1.44 million tonnes in 2015-16 to a high of 1.78 million tonnes in 2017-18 which subsequently fell to 1.72 million tonnes in 2019-20. To make up for the shortfall India often ends up importing up to a quarter of its domestic demand.

“For better price realisation for farmers we need to invest in improved varieties. Malt varieties which farmers are growing are at least a decade old while non-malt feed varieties are three decades old"" Chitlangia added.

India needs to crack varietal research in barley keeping in mind its agro-climatic diversity concurs Punit Gupta country director at TechnoServe which works closely with farmers to help them access better technologies and practices. “International brewers prefer two-row barley varieties where yields are usually lower. The malt varieties which farmers are pushed to grow do not make economic sense"" Gupta added.

However some have found a solution in the interim. “The focus of our work with farmers has been to get the desired quality and purchase at an assured price"" said Ashwin Kak procurement and sustainability head for India and South-East Asia at Anheuser-Busch InBev the world’s largest brewer. According to Kak the company has partnered with over 800 farmers in Haryana and Rajasthan to source quality barley for its premium brands. Ab InBev supplies farmers with seeds and growing instructions and its field staff monitor barley fields at regular intervals. This has encouraged a new breed of farmers to gradually move away from wheat and take up barley cultivation.

Mukesh Chauhan 30 a small farmer from Gurugram district of Haryana is among them. In his second year of barley cultivation Chauhan converted half of his six acres to grow a malt variety prompted by assured prices and lower input costs compared to wheat. Last month Chauhan sold his harvest at ₹1750 per quintal a significant premium over the government announced MSP of ₹1600 per quintal. “Gradually I want to convert most of my land into barley leaving just enough to grow wheat for home consumption"" Chauhan said.

While it is true that per capita beer consumption in India is low compared to other markets another way to look at the situation is the potential for future growth Kak said. “In recent years many new brands have been launched in India. There are new flavour variants; smaller brands have come up with a regional focus. The future looks bright which is why we are focusing on long-term sustainable partnerships with growers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vaGVhbHRoL3N0cnVnZ2xpbmctaG9zcGl0YWwtc3RyZXRjaGVkLXN1cHBsaWVyLWRpdmlkZWQtZ292dC1zdG9yeS1iZWhpbmQtZ29hcy1veHlnZW4tY3Jpc2lzLzY1ODYyNy_SAXpodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2hlYWx0aC9zdHJ1Z2dsaW5nLWhvc3BpdGFsLXN0cmV0Y2hlZC1zdXBwbGllci1kaXZpZGVkLWdvdnQtc3RvcnktYmVoaW5kLWdvYXMtb3h5Z2VuLWNyaXNpcy82NTg2MjcvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Struggling hospital stretched supplier divided govt — story behind Goa’s oxygen crisis,"“Oxygen cylinders being used for patients get over in the middle of the night and it takes 2-3 hours for replacement cylinders to come” the letter said. “Patients are kept without oxygen with saturations dropping to less than 60 per cent.”

The Goa Association of Resident Doctors had on 1 May written to the GMCH dean about issues with the supply of oxygen to Covid-19 wards in the hospital.

Mumbai: In the first 12 days of this month 417 Covid-19 patients died at the premier state-run Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) several of them due to a lack of oxygen. Many of the deaths occurred in the early hours of the morning after 1 am.

In this week alone there have been about 62 deaths between Monday and Thursday suspected to have been due to issues with oxygen supply. On the intervening night of Thursday and Friday there were reports of 13 more Covid deaths in the hospital due to fluctuations in oxygen supply. The state government is however yet to confirm this figure.

Lawyers activists and doctors ThePrint spoke to said there have been more of such incidents.

“We have lost colleagues a lot of them have suffered losses of their family members. All this has been due to mismanagement by the government and the lack of oxygen” Antonio Clovis Da Costa president of the South Goa Advocates Association told ThePrint. “We will be asking for an audit of all the deaths. Someone needs to be held accountable.”

The association is one of the petitioners in a case that the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court is hearing about the state government’s alleged mismanagement of health infrastructure amid the Covid pandemic.

Nowhere is it more evident than at the GMCH in Bambolim.

Behind the shocking numbers is the tragic story of a hospital stretched beyond its capacity; basic logistical issues such as lack of drivers to supply oxygen trolleys; inconsistent responses by different factions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Goa; and an overburdened oxygen manufacturer struggling to keep up with the demand.

CM says no shortage health minister says CM ‘misinformed’

The GMCH has a capacity of 708 but has currently admitted 953 patients. Of the 708 beds 160 are in the ICU unit. Patients without beds however have been accommodated on trolleys and on the floor and have to be administered oxygen through loose cylinders.

There have however been disruptions in oxygen supply with different arms of the state government — the dean of the hospital Dr S.M. Bandekar the state health department and the Chief Minister’s Office — inconsistent in their responses to explain the discrepancies.

Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has maintained that there is no shortage of oxygen and that the crisis is due to the “mismanagement” in getting the oxygen to the hospital. State Health Minister Vishwajit Rane who has been at loggerheads with the CM in the management of the pandemic called Sawant “misinformed.”

The state health department in its affidavit to the Bombay High Court maintained that the government is meeting Goa’s oxygen requirements but Dr Bandekar’s affidavit a copy of which is with ThePrint painted a more dire picture. It said there was a deficit of 6.5 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen as of 11 May when 330 of the 953 patients admitted to the hospital were on oxygen supply.

On Thursday Dr Bandekar told the Bombay High Court the hospital realistically needs at least 72 trolleys of oxygen if patients have to be effectively treated. Currently the supply of trolleys is in the 50s.

ThePrint reached State Health Minister Vishwajit Rane Dr Bandekar and Health Secretary Ravi Dhawan via phone calls but did receive a response till the time of publishing this report.

The midnight hours at GMCH

Every night social media and volunteer WhatsApp groups in Goa are flooded with desperate messages from relatives of patients at the GMCH about dropping oxygen levels.

The hospital relies on oxygen trolleys which have to be transported by tractors from the manufacturer Scoop Industries’ production plant at Corlim about 15 km away. These are then loaded on the hospital’s manifold.

The process of loading the oxygen cylinders usually causes fluctuations in oxygen supply for a short span of about 15 minutes multiple sources involved in the process told ThePrint.

Amit Palekar an advocate who is among the petitioners in the Bombay High Court and a member of several volunteer groups helping amid the pandemic said “There is a transition while shifting from one trolley to another during which there are fluctuations in oxygen supply. The doctors are not informed about it so they are unprepared. At night the oxygen saturation levels of patients are anyway lower so even a drop for a short period leaves critical patients breathless. There is panic and anxiety.”

The loading and unloading of trolleys on the manifold happens during the day as well but doctors say it might not impact the patient during the day as much as it does at night.

A senior pulmonologist in South Goa who did not wish to be named said “Generally too if a patient needs a litre of oxygen during the day doctors will budget for 1.5 litres at night.”

“When you are awake and the oxygen level drops the body responds by extending the respiratory range” he added. “But while sleeping the demand for oxygen goes up and if there is any fluctuation the chemoreceptors in the body including the brain do not respond as quickly.”

This problem is compounded by logistical issues in the supply of these oxygen trolleys.

Dr Bandekar’s affidavit to the Bombay High Court dated 12 May reads “…At times there has been a problem with the supply of these trolleys and loose cylinders as a result of which there have been instances of a drop in supply of oxygen to the patients which has resulted in casualties.”

The state government has cited the lack of tractor drivers as a reason for the fatal blip in oxygen supply.

On Thursday after 15 patients died late Wednesday night the state government told the Bombay High Court there was an issue with the movement of tractors to bring the trolleys to the hospital.

In its order Thursday the court said “… we were explained that there were logistical issues involved in manoeuvring the tractor that carries the trolleys of oxygen and in connecting the cylinders to the manifold. We were explained that during this process there was some interruption which resulted in a fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to the patients.”

Govt’s responsibility to transport oxygen: Manufacturer

Vivek Rodrigues the advocate for Scoop Industries told ThePrint that the company’s responsibility ends at production and the accountability for transporting the oxygen to the hospital lies fully with the state government.

He cited a letter dated 20 April sent by Dr Bandekar to the North Goa collector which says the hospital is deputing officials at the Corlim premises of Scoop Industries to monitor the oxygen trolleys “so that there is no delay in supply of oxygen which can cause threat to the life of patients”. ThePrint has a copy of the letter.

“Our job ends at production. From the Scoop Industries premises to GMCH the oxygen tanks are followed by two police cars so that they can reach without any obstruction” Rodrigues said. “The entire supply has been completely taken over by the government. The onus of getting drivers and all logistical issues lies with the government.”

He added that according to its contractual obligations the company has to supply just four oxygen trolleys but is currently supplying 57. “The company has borne the cost of manufacturing the additional trolleys” he said. “The quota from the Centre of 10-11 metric tonnes also comes to us we pay for it and distribute it to all hospitals along with the 30 metric tonnes that we produce.”

Rodrigues further claimed that while private hospitals are prompt with the payment the state government owes the company dues of Rs 3.75 crore accumulated over the past two months.

State scrambling to take measures

Following stringent criticism from the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court the opposition activists and volunteer groups the BJP government in Goa is now scrambling to take measures that can reduce the crisis at GMCH.

The load on beds eased slightly after the state government on 5 May commissioned the GMCH’s new super speciality block initially with 150 oxygen beds to be eventually scaled up to over 500.

The Super Speciality Block at Goa Medical College is being commissioned today. The facility has been equipped with an oxygen tank of 20000 litres. 150 oxygen beds will be utilized initially for #COVID19 patients and the same shall be scaled up as per the requirement. pic.twitter.com/HtwvrBFjBd — Dr. Pramod Sawant (@DrPramodPSawant) May 5 2021

The Centre Thursday also decided to increase oxygen supply to Goa by another 20 MT to 46 MT. Earlier the government had raised Goa’s oxygen allocation to 26 MT from about 11 MT last week.

The state government has also set up a three-member committee under IIT-Goa Director B.K. Mishra to probe oxygen supply issues at GMCH. It has also started construction of a medical oxygen tank with a capacity of 20000 litres at the hospital to reduce its dependence on the trolley system.

With rental prices sky high car-sharing companies get a boost,"Eduardo Maldonado and Karen Valencia both from Dallas are renting a car for the weekend from Avail on May 6 2021 in Schiller Park. (Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune/TNS)

A Memorial Day trip to hike and bike at Mississippi Palisades State Park seemed like an easy pandemic getaway — until Autumn Wolfer tried to book a rental car to drive there.

Including insurance some rental car companies wanted as much as $900 she said.

So Wolfer 43 of Chicago’s Ravenswood neighborhood checked out Turo a car-sharing company that lets people rent from individuals rather than companies like Hertz and Avis. Renting a 2020 Chevrolet Equinox from someone in Wicker Park cost just $250 she said.

“We’re paying $50 for the campsite. Paying $900 for the car just seemed kind of silly” she said.

Rental car companies that sold hundreds of thousands of vehicles when the COVID-19 pandemic kept people home are now struggling to bring in enough new cars leading to higher-than-usual prices and in some destinations limited options. For travelers that means planning ahead or considering alternative options from renting a stranger’s vehicle through a car-sharing service to driving a U-Haul.

“I think if you’re desperate enough you’re going to try everything” said Neil Abrams president of car rental consulting firm Abrams Consulting Group.

When the pandemic hit and travelers canceled trips rental car companies rushed to get rid of idle vehicles. Hertz which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last May got rid of about 198000 vehicles in the second half of 2020 according to the company’s annual report. Avis Budget Group said its fleet was about 31% smaller at the end of 2020 than the year before.

Just as travel started to bounce back this spring semiconductor shortages affecting car manufacturers made it difficult for rental agencies to bring in enough cars to meet the new demand.

Avis Budget Group is getting new cars every day and can keep existing cars longer since they racked up fewer miles during the pandemic but semiconductor shortages are having an impact CEO Joseph Ferraro said during an earnings call.

In the meantime price increases have been “extraordinary” Abrams said.

The average price for a four-day rental jumped from $260 in February to $321 in March and hit $388 during the final week of April according to data from travel search tool Hopper.

While the shortage is being felt nationwide certain destinations have seen especially large spikes.

Bozeman Mont. was the most expensive city to rent a car in during the final week of April with an average price of $259 per day according to travel search website Kayak. That’s up 278% compared with 2019.

Hawaii which has a tougher time bringing in new cars has also seen steep increases. Four of the 10 most expensive cities for car rentals were in Hawaii all of which saw prices more than double compared with 2019 according to Kayak.

In Hawaii at least some tourists appear to have turned to U-Haul pickup trucks and cargo vans. In April Kaleo Alau president of the U-Haul Co. of Hawaii said there had been a “considerable uptick” in visitors renting smaller vehicles for a few days to a week.

Other travelers are trying out companies that let users rent someone’s personal car.

Unlike a traditional rental car agency Turo doesn’t have a central lot at the airport so travelers either need to be able to get to the car owner’s location or rent from someone willing to bring the car to them. Owners are required to clean and disinfect vehicles before each trip focusing on frequently touched spots like the steering wheel door handles and fuel cap according to Turo’s website.

On Turo car owners set their prices and how many miles are included in the daily rate. As at traditional rental car companies insurance costs extra.

Drivers with auto insurance should check with their provider before renting but with most major auto insurance providers liability insurance will cover a driver regardless of where they rent said Laura Adams an insurance expert at AutoInsurance.org. Drivers should check whether they have collision insurance and whether it covers rental cars or only their personal car she said.

However a car owner who rents out their vehicle through a car-sharing service can’t rely on personal auto insurance said Loretta Worters spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute. Car-sharing companies provide insurance options for owners.

Adams also cautioned against relying on coverage provided by a credit card when renting a vehicle which can be more limited. Turo’s website warns users credit card companies are unlikely to cover peer-to-peer rentals.

Renting to strangers brings risks. Natanya Abraham 28 of Chicago started renting out her personal car on Turo in November to earn extra income when she wasn’t using it and has since added a second vehicle she bought specifically to rent.

A couple of customers have missed return deadlines and one brought the car back with a damaged rear bumper. Abraham had agreed to let the customer pay her directly to keep the car for extra time rather than paying through Turo so Turo didn’t cover the repair.

But the income which requires relatively little hands-on management is worth it Abraham said. She estimates she earned $2300 in April nearly double a typical month.

“I absolutely see myself doing this long-term” she said.

According to a company survey 73% of people who list at least three cars on Turo and treat it as a small business say they have seen an increase in bookings since the start of 2021 and 70% plan to purchase another car to list on the app within a year.

Other car-sharing companies said they think the tight supply of rental cars is giving their business a boost.

Avail which has a pickup lot a shuttle ride away from O’Hare International Airport said bookings have grown roughly 150% so far this year compared with the same period last year. Some of that is due to launching in new cities over the past year and travel recovering. But Business Operations Director Alex David said he thinks the “massive lack of cars” in the rental industry is helping. Vehicle listings were also up 150% as of March.

Avail is designed to feel more like a traditional car rental than other car-sharing services. Renters pick up cars from airport lots where cars are inspected and cleaned before being used the company said. To keep prices and fees consistent across cars Avail not the car owner sets prices David said.

The advertised rates include liability and physical damage insurance from Allstate which is an investor in Avail. Drivers found at fault in an accident have a $500 deductible.

Getaround another car-sharing company said it has seen a significant increase in demand in recent months. Most people using Getaround which rents by the hour book cars for errands or short trips so car rental shortages are just one factor driving demand Pat Notti Getaround’s vice president of marketplace and operations said in a statement. Still recent growth has been particularly strong among travelers and business in Florida has doubled since last year Notti said.

At Getaround the quoted prices include liability collision and comprehensive insurance coverage but renters are responsible for up to $3000 in damages unless they buy a protection plan that reduces that fee.

Getaround cars have a device installed that lets users unlock the car with keys inside for a contact-free pickup. As at Turo renters need to be able to get to the vehicle’s location.

Car-sharing services account for a “tiny fraction” of the overall rental market but high prices and limited availability at traditional agencies could push more consumers to give them a try Abrams said.

Still those companies may also raise prices and see more limited availability particularly in destinations where rental cars are toughest to find said Jonathan Weinberg CEO of car rental website AutoSlash.

Both Avail and Getaround said they factor expected demand into prices but Avail has imposed price caps of $125 or $150 per day depending on the type of vehicle David said. To build its pool of cars the company is also offering a $100 incentive to people who list their vehicle on Avail for the first time.

Regardless of where travelers rent it makes sense to plan ahead this year Weinberg said. It’s also worth checking off-airport rental locations or rental agencies at a nearby airport in case the price difference is large enough to cover the cost of a taxi or Uber Weinberg said.

“What we’re seeing today is really just a precursor to what we’re going to see this summer” he said.

Now? Not so much.

MIDLAND Texas — It was nice while it lasted. That is arriving at Midland International under an hour before your flight departed. Now things are changing as vaccinations continue and people are starting to travel more.

This has led to increased lines and wait time at bag check and security. MAF's Director of Airports Justine Ruff recommends arriving earlier than usual.

""Just make sure you get here early if you’re flying out. You know we haven’t left anyone behind who’s been here in plenty of time. It’s if you get here 45 minutes before your flight leaves and you’re stuck in line at the checkpoint for 30 minutes you’re not gonna make it"" Ruff said.

Ruff said that 90 minutes should be the bare minimum when flying out of MAF now.

""I would say you should be here particularly for flying out in the morning at least 90 minutes before your flight especially on a Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday which are the busiest days"" Ruff said.

COVID-19 has been the biggest contributor to fewer people flying over the last year and as a result there had been shorter wait times at airport security. Now? Things have changed.

""Well we had a worldwide pandemic for the last year and so people are feeling more comfortable with a vaccine that they can get out and travel and so we’re seeing an increase in travel"" Ruff said.

It's not just a minor increase in travel. The jump in travel has been huge.

""We are trending up. Last month which would be April 2021 when you compared it to April 2020 we were up 642%. April 2020 wasn’t a great month for anyone but I mean definitely we’re going in the right direction. That’s our second month of positive enplanements and we hope to see that continue"" Ruff said.

Mornings have typically been the busiest. Make sure to give yourself plenty of time if you have to fly out of MAF early in the morning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFsYXBwZWFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMDUvMTUvdHJ1Y2tpbmctY29tcGFuaWVzLXRyYWZmaWMtZGVsYXlzLTU1LWRldG91ci1tZW1waGlzLWJyaWRnZS81MDkxNzExMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A nightmare out there': Trucking companies avoid delays at I-55 detour from Memphis bridge,"A crack in the six-lane Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River is forcing traffic onto the four-lane I-55 bridge causing modest delays for some travelers and truckers.

But what happens if a wreck shutters the I-55 bridge too?

That's the question Mark Cooper co-owner and general manager of Memphis-based trucking company Cooper Freight said has kept him up at night this week: ""My biggest concern is that if there's an accident on the old bridge you've got everything shut down at that point. I don't see how they'd get emergency vehicles over.""

Cooper added: ""That would be the crisis that could happen at any moment.""

For truckers the added traffic on I-55 is more of an inconvenience than anything he said. Mid-Friday traffic cameras showed traffic moving over the bridge slowly but steadily. And like other local trucking companies Cooper Freight is sending trucks out earlier and telling drivers to avoid the bridge during morning and afternoon rush hours.

""It's a nightmare out there but we just avoid it at certain times"" Cooper said of the bridge.

Memphis Police Col. Keith Watson with the traffic division said the Tennessee Department of Transportation has vehicles on standby at the bridge to quickly clear wrecks. So far there has been a single fender-bender which was quickly cleared. There's also been more congestion and wrecks in the Downtown area as a result of the detour although the city hasn't seen a net increase in wrecks Watson said.

Watson warned that Arkansas residents trying to get to Memphis hospitals — including the Level 1 trauma center at Regional One — ""will be impacted"" by the bridge closure.

""Everyone wants to get home safe and to do that it's going to take all of us"" Watson said. ""Remember to slow down Memphis.""

With Memorial Day coming up on May 31 the department is also reaching out to encourage the use of alternate routes. The nearest interstate crossings are at I-555 near Dyersburg north of Memphis and at I-20 in Vicksburg Mississippi south of Memphis.

Dave Huneryager president and chief executive of the Tennessee Trucking Association said his organization has been working with the Tennessee Department of Transportation to spread the word about the delays at the I-55 bridge. Huneryager declined to speculate about the effects of a long-term closure but said the delays are much more than just a minor inconvenience especially for Memphis companies.

""It's certainly a serious inconvenience for the people in and around Memphis because they don't really have a choice to go another way"" he said.

Memphis has long branded itself as one of the nation's chief transportation and logistics hubs and not without reason. The city is home to one of the nation's top shippers FedEx which makes Memphis International Airport one of the busiest cargo airports in the world and is also centrally located within easy reach of rail river and roads.

""It's a major route — and a major bottleneck — for the industry for sure"" Huneryager said.

Asked how a months-long closure would affect the industry Huneryager chuckled dryly before declining to comment.

""We've gotta support the people who are making the decisions so that they're the best they possibly can be and that they get it open as quickly and safely as they can"" he said.

Ron Kennedy vice president of operations at Memphis-based Mid South Transport said the costs are ""workable"" right now but that any delay is going to increase costs which add up over time he said. For that reason the closure is a source of ""frustration.""

""As long as we keep our people informed and plan ahead a little bit and start out a little earlier you can take care of that delay"" Kennedy said. ""It's just an inconvenience for the guys to leave earlier to make sure they make it on time.""

Jason Higginbotham chief financial officer of Memphis-based Ozark Motor Lines which was previously sending 100 trucks across the bridges a day said the I-40 closure has easily added an extra hour each way which has ""really hit our ability to move freight.""

The troubles underline the importance of national infrastructure investments he said calling aging and worn-out infrastructure a problem that has ""got to be addressed.""

""Yes this is a glaring example of a crisis"" Higginbotham said.

The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) has given seven more countries its coveted ‘Safe Travels Stamp' including popular tourist hot spots like Thailand and Barbados.

The WTTC Safe Travel Stamp

The Safe Travel Stamp was launched 12 months ago to help restore confidence in travelers and revive the global travel and tourism sector which has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the WTTC the sector suffered a loss of almost US$4.5 trillion last year. They have been heavily advocating for the resumption of safe international travel to help the industry recover.

The stamp is the world's first-ever global safety and hygiene label taking into account health and safety guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It allows travelers to easily recognize governments and companies worldwide that have adopted the SafeTravels health and hygiene global standardized protocols to help them plan safe travels in a post-Covid world.

The stamp has been embraced by more than 200 Travel & Tourism CEOs and many of the world’s major tourism groups.

Since launching the stamp has been given to more than 275 destinations around the world.

7 More Countries Given the Safe Travel Stamp

Today the WTTC announced that Thailand Barbados Cyprus Abu Dhabi Bosnia and Herzegovina Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan are among the latest to join the ever-growing list.

Gloria Guevara WTTC President & CEO said:

“We are delighted that our Safe Travels stamp continues to grow from strength to strength and has been adopted by destinations from all corners of the world.

“From Portugal to Puerto Rico Sri Lanka to Slovenia Tunisia to Tobago our stamp is now recognised around the globe which is testimony to the hard work which has been put in to make the stamp work for both destinations and holidaymakers.

“As the global vaccine rollout picks up pace around the world and with travel restrictions beginning to be relaxed we believe the stamp will prove a key component of destination recovery and restoring consumer confidence.

“The success of the stamp shows the importance of global coordination to help rebuild and revive the international Travel & Tourism sector which has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“However we are finally beginning to step into the new normal of a post-COVID world and we are proud to be leading the way for globally coordinated efforts in recovery.”

Thailand Among Countries Added to Safe Travel List

One country travelers may be happy to know got added to the list is Thailand. The popular Southeast Asia destination has suffered a massive hit to its tourism industry due to Covid restrictions but recently announced a reopening plan to foreign tourists. They are planning to drop the quarantine for popular destinations in July which should help restart tourism along with the safe travel stamp.

Yuthasak Supasorn Governor Tourism Authority of Thailand said:

“The Tourism Authority of Thailand is delighted that the World Travel & Tourism Council has approved the use of the TAT's Amazing Thailand Safety and Health Administration (SHA) logo in tandem with the WTTC Safe Travels stamp.

“Together they share a common objective to ensure that all visitors feel safe as Thailand continues to open its tourism industry to international travel in the new normal.

“The Safe Travels stamp has reaffirmed the Amazing Thailand SHA and serves to further motivate travel-related enterprises in Thailand to maintain their health and safety standards as the country rebuilds traveller confidence while also protecting the Thai workforce that serves them.”

If you are interested in visiting Thailand right now here’s a step-by-step guide.

Other countries currently open for tourism that received the stamp include Barbados Bosnia and Herzegovina Cyprus and Kyrgyzstan.

The reporter called this “a landmark case which campaigners have hailed as a ‘victory for equality’”. The story appeared in The Guardian illustrated by a sweet photograph of a gaily painted traditional horse-drawn gypsy wagon with big wooden wheels.

Most of Britain would see things differently.

A group of Travellers has taken over much of the central car park in my nearest town Matlock. Because this is adjacent to both the railway station and Sainsbury’s townspeople observe Traveller life at close quarters and I’ve walked through the encampment many times a week for ages now. A scattering of Portaloos and wheelie-bins have arrived more caravans recently dogs on chains and a string of steel barricades: the town is facing a serious loss of amenity and people worry — reasonably or otherwise — about security.

Matlock does not want to present this face to tourists arriving by rail or bus. But it’s also fair to say these Travellers have done neither me nor anyone I know any harm. Public anger though is undeniable.

Our district council describes the core group (though further caravans have since arrived) as a “family [with] severe and complex welfare needs . . . joined by a related family who are in a similar position”. The council is caught between a statutory duty to provide a site for Travellers and intense local opposition to any proposed site.

So far so familiar. But this episode has encouraged me to examine a real-life example of a national problem that troubles many of us and to do some research and hard thinking.

If you’ve time I recommend reading the House of Commons library’s 2019 report on Gypsies and Travellers — not because it will help you understand but because it won’t. Inquire and you go down an Alice-in-Wonderland rabbit hole in which things that had seemed simple tangle into a mind-bending complexity from which you surface gasping that it’s all just too complicated. You give up.

Even the vocabulary stumps us. There are Gypsies and Travellers and Irish Travellers and Scottish Travellers and boat-dwellers and Roma and New Age travellers and much overlapping. Most are designated in law as an “ethnic grouping”. Many do in fact live in houses and don’t “travel” but reserve the right to travel as part of their “identity”. About 63000 people in Britain mostly in England self-define as Gypsies and Travellers but the real figure may be much larger. Some own the land they occupy; some are on “authorised” and others on “unauthorised” sites. During the decade to 2018 numbers increased by nearly a third.

These communities “experience some of the worst outcomes of any group across a wide range of social indicators. The Equality and Human Rights Commission . . . has concluded that the life chances of Gypsies and Travellers had declined . . . The contributory factors . . . may include deprivation social exclusion and discrimination” and “women’s equality” problems. A grim picture is painted of high mortality morbidity and long-term health conditions of low child immunisation and “poor health literacy” and the obvious difficulties with schooling.

Emerge with me from the rabbit hole breathe deeply and let’s take things back to essentials. The idea of Travellers’ human rights is rooted in the private “enclosures” (from the 16th century onwards) of once very extensive “common land” on which living and working had been quite normal. Whole swathes of people were dispossessed and not unnaturally the idea grew that they deserved special rights. Modern Travellers are the legatees of this idea.

There’s no doubt that travelling people are interconnected groupings with some common sense of identity and cultures that share distinctive features and problems; nor is there any doubt that they face rejection and prejudice from the property-rooted majority. I won’t get tangled in the weeds of accusation and counter-accusation but restrict myself to what follows.

One of my nephews is a “bargee” — he lives on his canal boat. He explains that though travellers on water are linked by some sense of community and communion with Britain’s canal network nomads of any kind do not feel the connection with one patch of land that most of us do because in their minds they are always ready to move on. We “somewhere” people see their (to us) careless treatment of land as uglifying and irresponsible. But their mindset has so much less sense of tether between person and real estate. With no common language (as it were) discussion and negotiation between the tethered and the untethered becomes almost impossible.

What have we here but the deathless conflict between the nomad and the pastoralist? Between (if you knew the rage of my late grandfather of FW Parris: High Class Family Butchers Sydenham) the shopkeeper and the stallholder?

And here I’m afraid this column must change key: from the reflective to the brutal.

There is simply no place for the true nomad in modern Britain. It isn’t their fault it isn’t our fault it isn’t the law’s fault but life here involves having an address being contactable keeping children in school paying tax on your property accepting responsibility for a defined patch of real estate as proprietor or tenant. The way we live in this country is as cruel to the British Traveller as in Algeria the mosque the walled oasis garden and the barbed-wire desert border-post is to the noble blue-veiled Tuareg tribesman and his camels. I prefer the company of the man on the camel but I would have to tell him that his way of life is finished.

It cannot be otherwise. So we should stop forcing local authorities to create Traveller sites phase out the “ethnic minority” rights of people who are not a race but a doomed mindset prioritise with the utmost generosity the offer of social housing to Traveller families; and to those who refuse it begin a gradual but relentless squeeze on anyone who tries without permission to park their home on public property or the property of others.

This should be done with as much humanity as is consistent with telling a group of people honestly that their lifestyle offers them and their children no future but their country wants to help them change it. Travellers are just people just human souls like you or me; good bad or indifferent like you or me; and victims of their circumstances perhaps more than you or me.

There is a place for them but no longer for their way of living. Is there a party is there a politician in Britain with the courage to say so?"

Limit the number of shifts. Here are 10 baseball changes we'd ...,"As another season of high strikeout rates and lower batting averages settles in Major League Baseball has begun its experiment with a cornucopia of rules changes in the minor leagues.

Limiting shifting moving the mound back 15-second pitch clocks larger bases and electronic strike zones — aka robo umps — are just a few examples of changes in store this summer at a minor-league ballpark probably not anywhere near you.

The idea is to make the game more exciting through higher contact rates greater athleticism and more baserunning with less downtime between the action.

Former Chicago Cubs President Theo Epstein hired as an MLB adviser to find solutions to the game’s most pressing issues has become baseball’s version of environmental activist Greta Thunberg seeking solutions to problems that pose grave danger if left uncorrected. Many of his disciples are praising the experimental changes including his Cubs successor Jed Hoyer.

“I love baseball” Hoyer said last month. “But I don’t believe that the rules are written on stone tablets.”

These days the rules seem to be written in invisible ink. We now have “ghost” runners seven-inning games for doubleheaders and baserunners called out on slides at second for lifting their leg off base for a nanosecond or two.

You can’t stop change. But we can provide our own solutions to help improve a product we love. Therefore here are 10 things we’d like to see written in stone.

1. Eliminate the dead zones.

Dead zone is not an official MLB term it’s what Chicago public transportation riders endure when the “L” is either stopped or at a snail-like crawl.

Baseball is full of dead zones and a prominent one begins the moment the batter is introduced to his personally picked walk-up song to the time the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand.

The batter waits until the final note is played then steps in the box and take a few more hacks before getting into his stance. The pitcher also not wanting to be rushed goes into deep breathing techniques he learned from the mental skills coach. Finally relaxed and properly focused he gets the sign and starts his windup.

Baseball might be a thinking person’s game but overthinking can grind it to a halt. Make hitters get into the box. Make pitchers throw the ball. Repeat. For advice on how to accomplish this just ask Mark Buehrle.

2. Institute the Designated PPP.

Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo pitches in the seventh inning against the Braves at Truist Park in Atlanta on April 28 2021.

A growing trend has been the use of position players as late-inning pitchers when the game is hopelessly lost. The manager doesn’t want to waste his corps of relievers who have been trained to throw only one or two innings and knows everyone gets a kick out of watching a position player try to pitch.

The Cubs used three position players in a loss to the Atlanta Braves which is two too many. Blowouts have been a part of baseball since the game began and with seven-pitcher bullpens the norm no team should be so bereft that it couldn’t use one reliever to finish a game.

But because that won’t happen the least MLB can do is force teams to designate a “PPP” (Position Player/Pitcher) on every roster. The PPP is the only one eligible to throw in blowouts so use him wisely.

3. Install permanent plate umpires.

Umpires are rotated every game. That means the ones best at calling balls and strikes could be manning first second or third base on any given day.

If making the strike zone more consistent is one of MLB’s goals the best of the best in that field should be awarded the jobs for an entire season with one per crew. Umpires are all rated on their zone accuracy based on technology so it wouldn’t be difficult to choose the most qualified. And after the season the bottom 10% go back to calling the bases with the best minor-league umps replacing them behind the plate.

Instead we’ll just get the robo umps or the end of baseball as we know it.

4. Ban reference cards.

Imagine Willie Mays pulling out an index card to see how to play Vic Wertz in the 1954 World Series or Bob Gibson pulling out a reference card to remember the proper pitch sequencing when facing Ernie Banks. When looking at cheat sheets is as prevalent as spitting the data revolution has gone too far.

Umpire Joe West confiscated a reference card a Philadelphia pitcher used during a Cubs-Phillies game in 2018. MLB ruled the cards were legal as long as checking one did not delay the game.

Then-Phillies manager Gabe Kapler called it a “great” ruling for players.

“I think it takes a lot of mental focus takes a lot of bandwidth to get out the best hitters in baseball” he said. “And when you can just take a little of that off your mind and put it on a card I think that’s helpful for pitchers and good for baseball.”

Players somehow managed to remember instructions without that “bandwidth” for more than a century. Signs were either relayed by hand or other gestures or a coach simply yelling “Move over” at an outfielder.

Former Cubs manager Joe Maddon said that day in ’18 that he believed in “information” but added: “I still like the idea of players looking in the dugout. I like that connection between on the field and the dugout and your coach.” Let the coaches coach.

5. Automated check-swing technology.

Detroit Tigers catcher Wilson Ramos (40) points to an umpire after Chicago White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu (79) stuck out during the third inning at Guaranteed Rate Field on April 27 2021.

No more looking at the first- or third-base ump for a ruling on a check swing that’s at least 90 feet away. Built-in sensors at the plate will beep if the bat passes a certain point that constitutes a swing.

Tennis uses an automated line-calling system instead of relying on judges to make the calls. Sounds simple enough to implement.

6. End the nickname deficit.

Mysterious Walker pitched in more than 60 games over five seasons with the Cincinnati Reds Cleveland Naps Brooklyn Superbas Pittsburgh Rebels and Brooklyn Tip-Tops between 1910-1915 going 7-23 with a 4.00 ERA.

What was so mysterious about Frederick Mitchell Walker that earned him that nickname? It remains a mystery to this day.

But we do know colorful nicknames used to be plentiful in baseball from the “Splendid Splinter” to “Oil Can” to “Wild Thing” and “The Big Hurt.” Outside of “The Yermínator” what other memorable nicknames have you heard lately? It’s up to the millennials and Generation Z to come up with better nicknames for modern-age athletes. The baby boomers are tired OK?

7. Create an Entertainer of the Year Award.

MLB loves creating new awards but somehow it has ignored the category of most entertaining player. Bat flipping fake selfie-taking during home run trips mound antics and creative dugout celebrations would be considered when selecting a winner of the Rickey Henderson Entertainer of the Year Award.

Pablo Sandoval Tim Anderson Fernando Tatís Jr. and Trevor Bauer all would have an equal shot at winning a Rickey in 2021.

8. Leave a little dirt on it.

A speck on the ball from a pitch that grazed the dirt merits a new one from the plate umpire. A catcher no longer even has to ask. He just holds the ball up without turning around and the umpire hands him a new one.

But is this really necessary? Is a ball that has come in contact with the ground for a split second really unusable?

The time-proven instructions parents traditionally have provided children following a minor injury was to “put a little dirt on it.” The same principle applies with a wayward slider.

9. Allow only three shifts per game.

If managers were limited by the number of times they could shift they might save them for the ends of games allowing more hitters a fighting chance early on. At least it would involve more strategy.

10. Elect the commissioner.

If we can vote on reality TV show contestants with ease why can’t we make the office of MLB Commissioner an elected position with a four-year term? Rob Manfred would be free to run again of course but so would any former player manager general manager executive sportswriter or broadcaster.

Epstein could be the front-runner if he declared his candidacy for 2022 but you can’t discount Bob Costas Curt Schilling Keith Olbermann Buck Showalter Vin Scully Roger Angell Mike Veeck or any number of other potential candidates. The campaigning alone would be worth it.

Trending Economic News

U.S. inflation accelerated at the fastest pace since 2008. Overall CPI increased 0.8% in April four times analysts’ expectations. Over the last 12 months CPI rose 4.9%.

1-Month Change

The index for used cars and trucks surged 10.0% in April.

The food price index climbed 0.5% with incremental gains across most categories. The largest increases were reported for pork (+2.4%) and beef & veal (+1.4%).

12-Month Change

Gasoline prices have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The energy index rose 25.1% over the past 12 months boosted by gasoline (+49.6%) and natural gas (+12.1%). High energy prices roused mounting inflation worries throughout the financial markets.

Food-away-from-home recovered significantly since summer 2020 with a 3.8% gain. The limited-service-meals index which includes pickup take-out and delivery restaurants jumped 6.2%.

PPI rose 0.6% in April double market projections.

The pricing pressure in commodities (e.g. lumber steel corn etc.) can have a ripple effect throughout the supply chain. While some companies are passing along higher labor and materials costs to customers other may not have that flexibility. The NFIB small business optimism index shows that many small businesses remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for 2021.

Today students at John Tyson Elementary are learning how to build their own garden.

Second through fourth graders spent the morning outside digging in the dirt and planting seeds and while it was a fun activity it comes with an important lesson.

“This will help me learn how to garden up until I am older” said Miller Waller.

Fourth-grader Miller Waller tells us he once tried to plant a garden at home but it didn’t work out. So he’s pretty excited about the new skills he learned.

“I’m going to see if we can make a new garden and that would be better than the other and be successful” said Waller.

Like Waller many kids were inspired to go home and start planting which is exactly what Marty Ordman had hoped would come from this

“It’s really important for kids to develop healthy eating habits and you try to force them to eat fruit or vegetables at home they’re going to say no but if they grow it and they kind of nurture it along they’re much more likely to try it and like it” she said.

The learning garden was made possible through a grant given by the Captain Planet Foundation Dole Packaged Foods and Harp's Foods.

The students built the gardening area and then planted the plants this morning.

They call it the salsa garden because they planted corn tomatoes peppers onions and herbs. Once the food is grown they will have the opportunity to learn how to cook the produce but along with teaching the students valuable life skills. This garden will help the community.

“My students wanted to meet an important need in our community and address food insecurity” said Jennifer Boogaart.

And that’s just what the garden will do.

“So the produce from this garden will be used to meet some needs for our community” said Boogaart.

According to Jennifer Boogaart this summer those in need can come and pick the produce themselves which Miller thinks is pretty important.

“We need people having food and it’s nicer to give than to just keep” said Waller.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL25wdGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS90aGlyZC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXJhbmNoZXItd29ya3MtdG8tZW5zdXJlLWZ1dHVyZS1pbi1yYW5jaGluZy1mb3ItaGlzLXNvbnMvYXJ0aWNsZV81ODliZDg3NC1iNGY5LTExZWItYmRiNC1hN2M3MWViZmQ0NDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third-generation rancher works to ensure future in ranching for his sons,"On Sept. 11 2001 Rusty Kemp was about to be married before returning to his McPherson County ranching roots.

He knew the New York City buildings collapsing before his eyes on television. He had trained briefly in Morgan Stanley’s World Trade Center offices after picking up his University of Nebraska at Kearney agribusiness degree in 1998.

“It was kind of surreal to see those buildings get knocked down” by the terrorist-hijacked planes said Kemp who worked in Morgan Stanley’s Kearney office for three years.

He and his wife Rachael exchanged vows 11 days later. “We went on our honeymoon and we had the whole plane to ourselves after that Sept. 11 attack.”

Then they were off to their newly purchased spread in McPherson County where the 1980s farm crisis had prompted older ranchers to discourage a young Kemp from coming home as an adult after college.

Even so “I worked for ranchers through college” he said. “Just what I wanted to do.”

Grandfather Emerson “Tom” Kemp had gotten off a Union Pacific train at North Platte as a 15-year-old in 1936.

He slept that night at the 12th and Jeffers Street intersection then “caught a ride to Tryon the next morning” to join two brothers who arrived ahead of him from Indiana Rusty said.

Kemp met his future wife during his brief stint at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln before switching to UNK.

Rachael who also holds an agribusiness degree worked three years for the IBP Inc. beef plant in Lexington (now owned by Tyson Foods) while Rusty worked in Kearney.

“That’s why it doesn’t frighten us” Kemp said of their quest to organize Sustainable Beef LLC and build an 875-employee beef processing plant at North Platte.

Between owned and leased land the Kemps raise about 1600 Black Angus and Hereford cattle on 30000 acres northwest of Tryon west of Nebraska Highway 97 and south of the Hooker County line.

The couple’s home place lies 11 miles off the highway down a sometimes-graveled sometimes-dirt unfenced road where cows and calves think nothing of coming up to check out strange cars on the path.

Kemp enjoys 2020s technological connections to the outside world. He usually moves his cattle out as yearlings watching them head for feedlots and processing plants across the nation.

He and Rachael whose family farmed and raised cattle near Doniphan got into ranching together at a good time he said.

“We were lucky on the timing when we bought this” he said. “It was before the land prices really took off. So we were very fortunate on the timing buying land and buying cattle.”

Even so “we’ve had challenging years” alongside good ones. The 2012 drought hit Kemp hard he said though the “mad cow disease” scare of 2003 also was difficult.

“That was an Old Testament wrath-of-God-type drought” in 2012 he said. “We’ve got the (Ogallala) aquifer under here” but there was “just no forage.”

The Kemps’ two sons commute 50 miles to school in North Platte where 16-year-old Cash is a North Platte High School sophomore and Tucker 12 is a sixth-grader at McDaid Elementary School.

Cash has shown interest in becoming a fourth-generation Kemp rancher Rusty said. Like younger Sustainable Beef partner Trey Wasserburger he hopes a new North Platte packing plant will help improve those odds.

“The market is what it is and it provides opportunities as well as challenges” Kemp said. “But we’ve just seen so much consolidation in the packing industry. We just don’t feel like we have a real strong market for us.”

In addition to Tyson the current U.S. “Big Four” meatpackers consist of JBS USA Cargill Inc. and National Beef Packing Co.

Those four account for a combined 80% of the nation’s meat processing. But “they can’t stop and shut down for a year” to update their equipment and redesign their plants Kemp said.

“I’m not picking a fight with the Big Four. We need them” he said. “We need them to process all the cattle we have. But we just feel like there’s a niche we can operate in in North Platte.”",,,,,,

League Park (1884-1911)

The Cincinnati Reds’ first true home League Park at Findlay and Western in West End opened in 1884. For the 1902 season the Reds built an elaborate Greco-Roman-styled grandstand called Palace of the Fans that signaled baseball was becoming America’s pastime. Less than a decade later the wooden stadium was torn down for a new ballpark on the same spot.

Crosley Field (1912-1972)

Crosley Field holds a special place in Cincinnati history. Built in the era of classic ballparks like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field it opened in 1912 as Redland Field but became Crosley Field in 1934 when Powel Crosley Jr. bought the team. Crosley Field hosted the first night baseball game in 1935 two World Series champions and the Beatles. The Reds moved to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season.

Cincinnati Gardens (1949-2018)

The indoor arena on Seymour Avenue in Roselawn was used for everything from boxing and basketball to concerts and carnivals. From 1957 to 1972 Cincinnati Gardens was the home of the NBA’s Cincinnati Royals. The historic highlights at the Gardens are many: Elvis the Beatles and Martin Luther King Jr. The arena was demolished in 2018.

Riverfront Stadium (1970-2002)

Riverfront Stadium hosted an All-Star Game and World Series before its first Opening Day. The home to both the Reds and the Bengals was one of the multisport stadium bowls popular in the 1970s and was part of long-planned redevelopment of the riverfront. Fans got to see the Big Red Machine the Bengals’ Freezer Bowl three World Series champs and Pete Rose notch his 4192nd hit. Renamed Cinergy Field in 1996 the stadium was demolished in 2002 as the Reds and Bengals built new stadiums.

Riverfront Coliseum (1975- )

Located next to Riverfront Stadium the indoor arena was the home of the Cincinnati Stingers pro hockey team from 1975-1979 then a string of minor league teams including the Cincinnati Cyclones since 1997. On Dec. 3 1979 11 young fans were killed when crowd surged to get into a concert for The Who at Riverfront Coliseum. It’s been called the Crown Firstar Center and U.S. Bank Arena; now it’s Heritage Bank Center.

Paul Brown Stadium (2000- )

In the 1990s the trend was to have unique stadiums that had a bit of personality. After a contentious half-cent stadium tax was approved by voters the Bengals got their own stadium in 2000 named for legendary Bengals founder Paul Brown. PBS has won national recognition for its design. Former Enquirer and Post columnist Bill Koch noted “This stadium celebrates its setting. … You are not in Anytown USA. You are unmistakably in Cincinnati.”

Great American Ball Park (2003- )

Great American Ball Park bookends the riverfront with the Bengals stadium as The Banks and Underground Railroad Freedom Center have filled in between. The Reds ballpark which opened in 2003 embraces its heritage with a steamboat in the outfield architectural touches that harken to Crosley Field and statues of Reds greats outside the main gate. GABP was host of the 2015 MLB All-Star Game.

TQL Stadium (2021- )

The opening of FC Cincinnati’s TQL Stadium marks the return of professional sports to West End for the first time since Crosley Field closed in 1970. Formerly known as West End Stadium the soccer venue is located in a neighborhood that has undergone tremendous upheaval and change over the decades. Officials hope the stadium will spark new development in the area while residents hope they don’t lose more of their community.

Youmna al-Sayed had less than an hour to get to safety.

But with just one elevator working in al-Jalaa tower an 11-storey building in Gaza City housing some 60 residential apartments and a number of offices including those of Al Jazeera Media Network and The Associated Press al-Sayed made a dash for the stairs.

“We left the elevator for the elderly and for the children to evacuate” the Palestinian freelance journalist said. “And we were all running down the stairs and whoever could help children took them down” she added. “I myself helped two children of the residents there and I took them downstairs – everyone was just running quickly.”

Moments earlier the Israeli army which has been bombarding Gaza for six straight days had given a telephone warning that residents had just an hour to evacuate the building before its fighter jets attacked it.

Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout also had to move quickly. He and his colleagues “started to collect as much as they could from the personal and equipment of the office – especially the cameras” al-Kahlout said.

But more time was needed.

“Just give me 15 minutes” an AP journalist pleaded over the phone with an Israeli intelligence officer. “We have a lot of equipment including the cameras other things” he added from outside the building. “I can bring all of it out.”

Jawad Mahdi the building’s owner also tried to buy more time.

“All I’m asking is to let four people … to go inside and get their cameras” he told the officer. “We respect your wishes we will not do it if you don’t allow it but give us 10 minutes.”

“There will be no 10 minutes” the officer replied. “No one is allowed to enter the building we already gave you an hour to evacuate.”

When the request was rejected Mahdi said: “You have destroyed our life’s work memories life. I will hang up do what you want. There is a God.”

The Israeli army claimed there were “military interests of the Hamas intelligence” in the building a standard line used after bombing buildings in Gaza and it accused the group running the territory of using journalists as human shields. However it provided no evidence to back up its claims.

“I have been working in this office for more than 10 years and I have never seen anything [suspicious]” al-Kahlout said.

AP VIDEO: Associated Press staff evacuated their office in Gaza City shortly before the building was destroyed in an Israel airstrike. https://t.co/Ib5T2SohXq — The Associated Press (@AP) May 15 2021

“I even asked my colleagues if they’ve seen anything suspicious and they all confirmed to me that they have never seen any military aspects or the fighters even coming in and out” he added.

“In our building we have lots of families that we know for more than 10 years we meet each other every day on our way in and out to the office.”

Gary Pruitt president and CEO of AP also told Al Jazeera: “I can tell you that we’ve been in that building for about 15 years for our bureau. We certainly had no sense that Hamas was there.”

Al-Sayed who has been covering Israel’s bombardment for Al Jazeera and has worked for AP said she could not understand what threat a building housing families and offices for lawyers doctors and media workers could pose.

“Where is the alarm from this? Where are the Hamas or any military members that could be in this building?” the Gaza resident asked.

“The people here the residents all know each other. The first five floors are for offices that are [closed] during this time of escalation. So basically what is [still here] are the two media offices of Al Jazeera and AP and the residential apartments.”

Still at 3:12pm (12:12 GMT) the first Israeli strike came. Five minutes later al-Jalaa tower crashed to the ground after being hit by three missiles that sent a dark cloud of dust and debris into the air. There have been no immediate reports of casualties.

“Years of memories years of work in this building suddenly everything is rubble” said al-Kahlout about the tower from whose roof he often broadcast from. “Just vanished.”

Islam az-Zaeem a lawyer who worked in the building was at home when his cousin – the owner of the Johara building that was flattened overnight on May 13 – knocked on his door and told him al-Jalaa was about to be destroyed.

“I ran to the building and saw the residents and other employees gathered outside” az-Zaeem told Al Jazeera.

“I went inside and took the stairs since the electricity was out and the elevators weren’t working. I was hysterical and fell down several times in the dark shouting and crying.”

Az-Zaeem who said nine legal associates and four interns worked on his floor left the building five minutes before it was levelled.

“Even after the building fell I kept shouting that I’d forgotten to lock the door to my office” he said. “Imagine that.”

AP journalist Fares Akram said he had been sleeping in the office after a long night of reporting when his colleagues began shouting “Evacuation! Evacuation!” Akram grabbed what he could – a laptop some electronics and a few things from his desk – before running down the stairs and jumping into his car he wrote in a written piece after the attack.

When he was far enough away Akram stopped the car and got out to look back at the tower. He said he witnessed drone strikes hit the building followed by three more powerful strikes from F-16s.

“At first it looked like layers of something collapsing. I thought of a bowl of potato chips and what might happen if you slammed a fist into them. Then the smoke and dust enveloped everything. The sky rumbled. And the building that was home to some people an office to others and both to me disappeared in a shroud of dust” Akram wrote.

The building built in the mid-1990s was one of Gaza City’s oldest high-rises.

Fares al-Ghoul the executive director for the Mayadeen Media Group said his company was previously based in the Shorouq building which was destroyed by Israeli missiles on May 13.

“The upper floors of Shorouq were targeted in the 2014 war” he said. “In 2019 we moved the company to al-Jalaa building because we thought it would be safer since it accommodated the offices of international media agencies.”

“Now both have been destroyed” he said.

‘No place is safe in Gaza’

The bombing of al-Jalaa widely condemned as an attempt to “silence” journalists covering Israel’s offensive came just hours after an Israeli air raid at Shati refugee camp killed 10 members of the same family – eight children two women – celebrating Eid al-Fitr the religious festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

At least 174 Palestinians including 47 children have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israeli air raids on the coastal Palestinian territory began on Monday. About 950 others have been wounded.

The violence comes after Israel’s plan to forcibly displace Palestinian families from occupied East Jerusalem and its attacks on Palestinian worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound spurred widespread protests in Jerusalem the occupied West Bank and inside Israel. Hamas said it began firing rockets towards Israel in response to that Israeli crackdown. At least nine people have also been killed in Israel.

As evening fell on Gaza families and journalists started returning to al-Jalaa in the hopes of salvaging some of their belongings buried underneath the rubble.

“One person came back to look for some paintings done by his daughter because these paintings carried a lot of memories” said al-Kahlout who continued reporting from the streets of the bombarded enclave. “We moved outside and are now applying our emergency plans for reporting. We are trying to be safe. No place is safe in Gaza but we are trying to do our best.”

Al-Sayed meanwhile headed to al-Shifa Hospital believed to be a safe space to broadcast from. “It’s devastating” she said of the al-Jalaa building’s flattening.

“I worked in that place and my heart was broken to see it being brought to the ground it was tragic. Every place whether we work or we live we have incredible memories” she added.

“What about those families who have lost their homes who have lost everything they saved to get these apartments? In Gaza it’s not an easy thing to be able to get an apartment and now in just minutes [they] lose everything.

Our support to the Black community remains unwavering and our commitment to being an anti-racist company is stronger than ever. Today we are sharing our progress on our anti-racism commitments and how we plan to continue to fight against racism and inequality both within and outside our company.

Ridding our platform of racism

Together with experts we are developing new anti-racism training for drivers and riders. Last week we kicked off our first pilot in Brazil with one of our local partners Promundo providing virtual training to all riders and earners in the country. We will leverage these learnings to further shape our training for our users around the world.

We’ve made it easier for users to report incidents by adding a standalone option in the app to report racism and discrimination and we have enhanced our processes of handling discrimination incidents to further improve the customer experience and actioning.

Fighting Racism with Technology

We hired our first ever Inclusive Design Lead Erica Ellis  to help design and build products that are inclusive and meet the needs of our customers no matter your race gender age sexual orientation or ability . We are also creating additional roles to support this important work.

We launched a Fairness Research Team dedicated to measuring and understanding the impact that our pricing matching and safety products have on users from underserved communities. Additionally we have expanded our Fairness Working Group to include additional members encompassing lawyers data scientists product managers policy experts and members of Uber’s ERGs to capture a greater diversity of perspectives when conducting fairness assessments.

We know we need diverse teams to serve our diverse customer base around the globe which is why we have expanded our fellowship program ‘Uber Career Prep’ beyond the United States to accept applicants studying at universities in Brazil and Canada. A member of Uber’s Executive Leadership Team will participate as an instructor in each workshop. This year’s program includes 41 diverse fellows 23 of whom are women. Each of the fellows has a 1:1 mentor from Uber’s engineering team for the duration of 2021 and is guaranteed the opportunity to interview for a full-time or internship role with Uber upon completion of the program.

Sustaining Equity and Belonging for All

Four years ago we analyzed our salary data and made adjustments to achieve pay equity on the basis of race and gender. In 2020 women at Uber globally earned $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by men performing similar job functions. In the same time period in the US in aggregate employees from underrepresented racial backgrounds earned $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by non-underrepresented peers at the same job level. We will continue to focus on maintaining this important measure of equity going forward.

To increase Black representation in leadership we have made changes to our hiring strategy by introducing dedicated sourcing time with Executive Talent Acquisition teams committing 2-4 weeks upfront to proactively build a diverse pipeline of talent. We also started applying the Mansfield Rule -a commitment to interviewing a candidate pool which matches or exceeds market supply for diversity- and we created an Uber Executive Networking program to proactively cultivate relationships between members of our Executive Leadership team and external female Black and Latinx Executives.

We understand it’s our responsibility as an organization to help individuals manage inclusively. Starting June we will offer inclusive management and cross-cultural competency training to the first 2000 people managers at Uber.

To advance the mobility of internal emerging leaders into leadership opportunities we achieved 50% diverse representation in our mid-career level development program which equips participants with key skills to grow into senior leadership roles within the next 12 months.

Driving Equity in the Community

As one of the first non-financial institutions we invested $50 million in support of minority and underserved communities: $25 million was committed to the MDI Keeper’s Fund -a private investment fund sponsored by the National Bankers Association- and we allocated $ 25 million of unrestricted cash via deposits to qualifying MDIs.

We committed 10 million free or discounted rides to help make sure that transportation is never a barrier to getting the vaccine. We launched this initiative in partnership with the National Urban League National Action Network Morehouse School of Medicine and LULAC—organizations with deep ties to the communities of color that have been disproportionately hurt by the pandemic.

To help consumers support Black-owned businesses on Uber Eats we committed to $0 delivery fees for all orders from these restaurants in 2020. In total 3.5M $0 delivery fee trips took place last year. And we have taken steps to more effectively identify and highlight Black-owned restaurants on Uber Eats permanently with consulting and verification support from EatOkra  a Black-owned restaurant aggregator company working across the US.

In partnership with EatOkra and local community organizations and Black business leaders in Harlem and Washington DC we’ve launched public space popups ( Harlem & DC ) highlighting Black owned restaurants to help provide additional earning opportunities and to celebrate the Black community. We plan to expand this work to additional locations this year.

In addition to last year’s commitments we also expanded some of our existing efforts. In 2019 we tied executive compensation to our D&I metrics to make sure those at the highest levels are held accountable for this important work. This year we expanded this accountability model and introduced D&I objectives for our top 50 leaders across the company to support Uber’s overall diversity objectives.

We also stood up against increased hate and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. We pledged $500K to support the important work of the AAPI community working with local organizations in the community. And we partnered with Hollaback to provide bystander intervention resources to those on our platform.

While we have made strides in our efforts we know we still have a long way to go. We’re committed to keeping you informed on our ongoing efforts and we’ll share more updates here in the months to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNS91cy91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1kZWJ0LXBhaWQtZ3JhZHVhdGVzLXRybmQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDUvMTUvdXMvdWJlci1kcml2ZXItZGVidC1wYWlkLWdyYWR1YXRlcy10cm5k?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Uber driver earns bachelor's degree after a passenger paid off her debt,"CNN —

A single mother who used to drive for Uber has a bachelor’s degree now thanks to a passenger from three years ago.

It’s a big milestone for Latonya Young who dropped out of high school when she was 16 to raise her first child then later dropped out of college.

In 2018 Young was an Uber driver a hair stylist and a mother of three. She told one of her passengers in Atlanta her story and how she couldn’t re-enroll at Georgia State University because of a $700 balance she owed.

It seemed like a typical ride but she later learned it was life-changing.

That’s because her passenger Kevin Esch ended up paying her outstanding balance at Georgia State and the school told her she could register for classes again.

“Literally I was blown away” Young told CNN affiliate WSB. “A stranger has never done that – or done anything like that – for me.”

Esch said Young resonated with him moving him to help her out.

“I was in a pretty low place in my life and I was going through a divorce and she lifted me up by the time I got back home” he told CNN Full Circle. “I thought the least I could do is at least give her something to help her.”

Young earned her associate’s degree in December of 2019. Earlier this month she received a bachelor of science in criminal justice according to WSB. She’d like to become a federal probation officer.

“It’s the best feeling in the world. It’s a feeling I really can’t explain. I never thought I’d be where I am today” Young told WSB. “I pray to God that I get a good job opportunity that pays well so I can pay my loans and take care of my child.”

Esch told the affiliate he’s proud of Young.

“She’s done an amazing job to make it this far. Through the pandemic through virtual schooling through everything. It’s amazing” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vbXlydGxlLWJlYWNoL3ViZXItbHlmdC1sb29raW5nLWZvci1tb3JlLWRyaXZlcnMtaW4tc2NzLWhvdC1teXJ0bGUtYmVhY2gtY2hhcmxlc3Rvbi10b3VyaXN0LW1hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMzA4M2YxMC1iMjg5LTExZWItYmIzMS0zYjFiZjZjMGQwMDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Lyft looking for more drivers in SC's hot Myrtle Beach Charleston tourist markets,"MYRTLE BEACH — The weakened workforce has taken its toll on rideshare companies Uber and Lyft and both are stepping up to pay bonuses to lure more drivers as the coastal region buckles down for a busy post-coronavirus tourist season.

Drivers for Uber who average 20 hours per week behind the wheel are now making $32.50 an hour compared to $24.93 an hour at the start of the year in both the Charleston and Myrtle Beach areas. The raise was courtesy of a $250 million driver stimulus package designed to attract new drivers and to lure former Uber drivers back to the company’s platform said Javi Correoso a spokesperson for the ride-sharing app.

Lyft said it does not share specific market data. But a driver during a recent mid-week night trip on Lyft said he drove to Myrtle Beach from Atlanta because of the incentive the company was offering.

""We’re seeing big increases in demand for rides as vaccines roll out and people get ready to start moving again” Lyft said in a statement. “We’re working to meet demand including providing incentives to drivers who are busier and earning more than they were even before the pandemic.""

Lyft recently reported at the start of March rideshare ride volume reached a new record level for 2021 and recorded their biggest week since March 2020.

Though $32.50 an hour may sound like a lot rideshare drivers are considered independent contractors and must claim earnings on their income taxes for the year. Also drivers’ driving records and their vehicles are inspected before working for either company.

Correoso said Uber has seen more requests for rides in tourist destinations like Charleston and Myrtle Beach as more people become vaccinated from COVID-19 and travel increases.

Correoso said Uber learned it’s not just the money that will bring those drivers back — safety also plays a major role.

“What we’ve heard from drivers specifically in some of the tourism-heavy markets in the Southeast U.S. is that some of the drivers tend to skew a little older"" he said. ""Some of those drivers still don’t feel comfortable returning to drive. Either they haven’t been vaccinated or they still don’t feel comfortable having someone in the car at a close proximity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL3ViZXItbGF1bmNoZWQtYW50aS1yYWNpc20tY2FtcGFpZ24tMTU1MjM2NjA1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber has launched a new anti-racism campaign and committed to fresh hiring practices aimed at improving diversity,"On Friday Uber announced the launch of a new anti-racism initiative.

Its plans involve more training for drivers and riders and new hiring practices.

The move comes after Uber pledged to make its business more diverse.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Uber on Friday launched a new anti-racism campaign and committed to new internal hiring practices to help boost diversity.

In a statement on its website the company said it had started a pilot program in Brazil with one of their local partners Promundo. It provided virtual training to all riders and earners in the country as part of their new campaign.

Uber also hired its first inclusive design lead Erica Ellis to assist with designing and building products that are inclusive and meet the needs of as many customers as possible.

The firm added that it would change its hiring strategy to add two to four weeks of sourcing to build a diverse talent pool.

The announcement follows 14 commitments Uber laid out last July to combat racism and support the Black community.

Last year Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company must do more to combat racial inequality both within its ranks and in the communities it serves as Insider reported.

The pledge followed the death of George Floyd last May - whose killing sparked protests worldwide. Employers were pushed by employees and service users alike to combat systemic racism within their own companies.

In the past Uber has faced accusations of racial discrimination. In 2018 Liane Hornsey the company's chief people officer stepped down following an investigation into how she handled complaints of racial discrimination within the company according to Reuters.

""We will continue to work hard to fight racism and inequality both within and outside our company"" an Uber spokesperson told Axios on Friday.

A certain stall recently caught my attention — they serve a claypot bee hoon that comes with a magnificent crown of deep-fried bee hoon. Not only that they also serve up maki sushi as well. Bringing affordable Japanese food and claypot dishes together under one coffee shop roof is Hot Jap.

The HotJap Mee Hoon ($6.90/12.90) comes with three choices of protein: chicken seafood and shabu-shabu. If you prefer to skip the crispy bee hoon there’s the HotJap Mee ($6.90/12.90) with either seafood or mushroom tomato chicken. Salmon lovers should give their Salmon Soup ($5.90/10.90) a go. It doesn’t seem to come with rice but it would be nice if it was paired with a small bowl of it.

The Maki side of the menu certainly looked luxurious. The sushi fillings are split into three different tiers with options like katsu chicken and crab meat in the basic one ($8.90) and additions of smoked duck and abalone in the premium category ($12.90) and unagi and smoked salmon in the deluxe ($13.90) category. They also have an array of sauces to choose from to top your sushi off with like lemon tobiko and wasabi mayo.





A buzzer was given after I made my order and it was a while before I collected my first dish which was the Ebi Fry Maki topped with the ever-popular mentaiko sauce and ebiko. There were eight pieces which was a pretty good portion for its price. Stuffed with fried ebi and some chives it made quite a tasty mouthful together with the rich mentaiko sauce.

The HotJap Mee Hoon was an absolute stunner with a beautiful fried bee hoon nest perched on the edge of the claypot. Some might find this dish similar to the crispy noodles that can be found at zi char stalls but to me this was much better because the thin bee hoon strands made it even crisper.

Made with pork bone broth that had been boiled painstakingly for at least eight hours the thick aromatic gravy was super flavourful. Hiding beneath were a couple of prawns lala and greens with an egg beaten into the broth.

I first tried breaking off a chunk of the bee hoon for a very quick dip into the gravy so that it stays crisp without becoming soggy. And I LOVED it. In addition it was not oily at all. I also tried leaving it to soak up all the flavour from the broth and that was also delicious for me to gobble it all up in a heartbeat.

Hot Jap is a good place for friends and family to enjoy a good meal together. The latter part was especially true for me as my parents are ones to enjoy such claypot dishes while my younger siblings expressed more interest towards the maki. For me the HotJap Mee Hoon is a definite must-try!

“It’s awful and to see it on such a large scale. It is so toxic. It’s such toxic behavior… Just because people have followers doesn’t mean that they’re any less human. [It’s not like] when you cut them they don’t bleed or they’re not hurt.”

This year you might want to register for a free seat. Why? The short answer is Rancher and Kubernetes.

One thing is certain: the addition of Rancher means the SUSE you'll be seeing at this year's event won't be the same SUSE that put on last year's show.

Rancher is the San Francisco-based Kubernetes startup that SUSE spent at least $600 million acquiring last year an acquisition that allowed SUSE to offer its own solutions in the cloud-native market instead of having to follow Red Hat's lead.

The company was already an important part of the Kubernetes ecosystem when SUSE picked it up with a host of products designed to make Kubernetes easy to use. Rancher’s centerpiece was its eponymous flagship platform which supplies users with a command center for centrally managing on-premise or hybrid clusters.

In addition Rancher markets a CNCF-certified Kubernetes engine a distributed block storage built for Kubernetes called Lonhghorn and K3s a minified version Kubernetes originally meant for edge deployments but which now serves as RKE's core.

Rancher is a good fit for SUSE not only because it brought a product line that SUSE needed but because of its commitment to open source. Both Longhorn and K3s have been contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation under governance that's independent of SUSE/Rancher.

According to market researcher Omdia (owned by ITPro Today parent company Informa Tech) in Rancher's last year as an independent company its 3.9% share of container space -- with revenues of over $37 million -- put it in fourth place in that market behind Red Hat Mirantis and VMware.

Expect Rancher to be front and center at SUSECON and expect some Rancher-focused news.

Star-Bound Keynotes

Although SUSECON traditionally concentrates on the EU market this year it's bending over backwards to accommodate North American viewers scheduling the keynotes to go live at 10 am EDT or 7 am PDT.

SUSE's CEO Melissa Di Donato will get things started with a brief welcome before spending 10 minutes or so with Sheng Liang one-time Rancher CEO and now SUSE's president of engineering and innovation. Liang will spend a total of 30 minutes in front of the camera and it will be during this time that the important non-sponsor dependent news announcements will most likely be made.

Liang will be followed at 10:30 am EDT by ""The Sky Is Not the Limit: Lessons From a Year in Space"" a keynote address from retired astronaut Scott Kelly veteran of two Space Shuttle flights and who spent five months aboard the International Space Station beginning in October 2010. Kelly is also the identical twin of retired astronaut and current Senator from Arizona Mark Kelly. He is also brother-in-law to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who suffered a brain injury after being shot in the head during an assassination attempt in 2011.

As of press time SUSECON has 136 conference sessions and 19 demos and 12 futures on the conference catalog. As you might expect there will be a lot of Rancher and Kubernetes -- with 43 sessions and seven demos under the ""Kube"" track.

Searching through the presentations on the SUSECON website is easy enough as the schedule has several filters for narrowing results even including technical level (either ""business level overview"" or beginner intermediate or advanced ""technical"").

There are a few frustrating omissions to the online schedule's design however. There is no speakers list that we could find making it overly difficult to see if any of your favorites will be giving a talk and all times are in British Summer Time (BST) which means attendees outside the British Isles may have to use a time zone converter to see what time a session will happen in your area. All sessions will be available for on demand viewing after their live streaming.

As celebrity hair and makeup artists will tell you even the most low-maintenance effect requires well a little bit of maintenance. Thankfully there are some minimal summer makeup must-haves that make it a whole lot simpler and will let your natural beauty shine keep you hydrated and protected and feel so unfussy even in the season’s heat.

Not everyone feels 100% confident with a completely bare face. For example you might just want to brighten up your under eye area disguise a blemish or two or give your unruly brows some shape without looking like you’ve caked on the makeup. A simplified summer beauty routine involves embracing the heat (while staying protected from harmful rays of course) and feeling gorgeous with as few products as you can get away with. The effect doesn’t just look effortless it’s conducive to the outdoor activities that you’d probably rather be doing anyway.

Makeup and hair artist Chanel Cross who has worked with celebrities like Debby Ryan and Rachel Zoe and whose work has appeared in Vogue as well as campaigns for stylish brands like Jenni Kayne and Chan Luu has earned a reputation for her knack for creating a natural lit-from-within glow that’s ideal for the summer. Of course Cross has her kit stocked with a slew of products — from cult favorites to the just-launched — but if she had to narrow it down to just a few that you could toss into your beach bag and call it a day she’s got some favorites. Ahead find out which six items she thinks make for your easiest summer beauty routine.

We only include products that have been independently selected by TZR's editorial team. However we may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.

Minimal Summer Makeup Must-Have: Sunscreen

Cross is religious about SPF and she always leans on a cult favorite for its feel finish and level of protection. “OK I know everyone loves it but EltaMD UV Clear SPF is the only one” she says.

Minimal Summer Makeup Must-Have: Creamy Concealer

Cross recommends skipping foundation in lieu of few of a few dots of a creamy concealer like the Nars bestseller in the spots you want to camouflage and letting the rest of your skin be bright. Her pro tip? Buy it in the mini size so you can easily tote it in your beach bag and if you have to buy a darker shade for summer you won’t have to be as committed.

Minimal Summer Makeup Must-Have: Lip Eye & Cheek Stick

For an easy monochromatic look Cross loves a good multistick that can be used a few ways. “Olio E Osso’s multi-balms are so hydrating and add a pop of color to cheeks lids and lips” she says.

Minimal Summer Makeup Must-Have: Bronzer

Cross believes bronzers are an essential part of a minimal summer makeup routine “because you want a summer glow but don’t want to compromise your skin health.” She suggests using a soft brush and applying where the sun naturally hits as well as the edges of the face for a subtle contour.

Minimal Summer Makeup Must-Have: Brow Gel (Or Soap)

To keep brows looking fluffy but also held in place Cross has been trying the soap brow technique for her every day look. “I’ve been using plain glycerin soap and a damp spoolie.” she explains. For a gel that offers a similar effect she also is a fan of Kosas’ new Air Brow in the clear shade.

Minimal Summer Makeup Must-Have: Body Oil

You can add little oil to your shoulders and collar bone for a summer-y sheen but Cross suggests another use for the product as well. “It can double as a leave-in hair treatment” she says. “Slick back your hair to deeply nourish while you’re poolside.” The makeup artist loves the lemongrass one from Trader Joe’s but is also a fan of the latest RŌZ oil which is just as fragrant and hydrating.

Like fashion beauty has the power to whisk you away from reality and offer some sense of solace. This is not an exaggeration either.

Following the aftermath of the 2001 recession the term ""lipstick index"" was coined by Leonard Lauder the former chairman of Estée Lauder. Interestingly lipstick sales began soaring during that time of hardship with the Lauder heir explaining ""Women facing an uncertain environment turn to beauty products as an affordable indulgence while they cut back on more expensive items.""

While lipstick sales aren't necessarily skyrocketing these days due to mask mandates amid the coronavirus pandemic that doesn't mean brands have slowed down with new beauty releases.

Universal Health Services a Pennsylvania-based publicly traded company that operates more than 185 inpatient behavioral health facilities around the country is financing construction of a new $40 million psychiatric hospital in Dearborn for Beaumont and will run day-to-day operations once it opens.

Tom Watkins who used to lead the Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority said he worries that Universal's bottom line is to make money for its shareholders and that could put low-income patients in danger.

""Their goal is to make money and there's not a lot of profit in taking in very very sick patients"" Watkins said. ""The beds tend not to take the public patients.""

Mark Reinstein who led the Mental Health Association in Michigan for nearly two decades said he is also troubled by the allegations raised in the whistleblower lawsuits against Universal and asked: ""Are we going to see some of these things in the new hospital?""

Beaumont will move its three psychiatric units from its hospitals in Taylor Farmington Hills and Royal Oak into the new building doubling its inpatient capacity to 150 beds including 24 new beds for children and teens. The hospital at more than 100000 square feet is expected to open this fall.

""It will be a UHS facility with a Beaumont label on it"" said a Beaumont psychiatrist who ""adamantly opposed"" the plan when it was announced. The psychiatrist who asked to remain anonymous for job protection reasons remains frustrated by what the doctor called a lack of transparency from Beaumont about how the new hospital will be staffed. The physician also said it was unclear whether current employees will be able to keep their jobs and seniority.

In a statement Beaumont said employees would need to apply to work at the new campus but the joint venture would recognize their seniority and experience. Beaumont said the timetable for moving its psychiatric units into the hospital hinges on state regulatory approvals and the ownership split will not be known until the project is done.

Beaumont said it considered more than a dozen potential partners conducted an extensive vetting process and made its decision with input from doctors nurses other staff and community members. Dearborn was chosen because it is easily accessible to a significant portion of its patients according to the health system. Beaumont announced its plans for a new psychiatric hospital with Universal in November 2018.

""This new campus will provide care in a leading-edge facility accessible to many patients"" Lee Ann Odom president of Beaumont Shared Services said in a statement.

It's been a tumultuous year for Beaumont one of Michigan's largest health care systems based in Southfield. Beaumont eliminated jobs and laid off workers as its finances plummeted at the start of the pandemic and called off an unpopular merger with an out-of-state hospital system. A widening rift between doctors and executives prompted a former board member to ask Michigan's attorney general to intervene saying the discord was jeopardizing patient health and safety.

A Free Press investigation found that Beaumont's own doctors warned executives against the deal with Universal. The health care company agreed last year to pay $122 million to settle 19 federal whistleblower lawsuits that alleged some of its mental health hospitals including two in Michigan mistreated patients and filed false claims against government insurance programs.

One of the Michigan cases against Havenwyck Hospital in Auburn Hills alleged the hospital's practices put patients at risk of death.

According to the Justice Department the settlement is among the largest reached by the department in recent years in cases against medical providers accused of billing for medically unnecessary services or charging for services not provided as billed.

As the whistleblower cases made their way through court Universal was also under criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. But the criminal inquiry was closed as Universal and the government moved toward a civil settlement according to a company annual report.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Georgia in April 2014 ... Defendant resorted to filling beds with “7” ""frequent flyers” who were attracted to the St. Simon By-The-Sea’s “three hot meals and a cot.” Many of these inpatient “frequent flyers” were homeless people with substance abuse problems who had nowhere else to go and did not meet any criteria for admission.

As part of that settlement agreement Universal is now under oversight from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' office of the inspector general which can inspect the company's records and talk to staff to ensure Universal is complying with its corporate integrity agreement with the federal government.

Universal ""unequivocally disputes any allegation that it engaged in wrongdoing of any kind"" Diane Henneman who oversees Universal's behavioral health facilities in the Midwest said in a statement.

But starting in 2006 according to the whistleblowers involved in the cases company employees at some hospitals forcibly drugged patients to punish or incapacitate them; recruited patients in emergency rooms group homes military bases and a soup kitchen and held patients longer than medically necessary to collect their insurance benefits.

The lawsuits also claimed some Universal hospitals billed Medicare and Medicaid for group therapy sessions that never happened handed out cigarettes and personal hygiene products to mollify patients and threatened to call law enforcement to force parents to admit their children even if it wasn't medically necessary.

Separately Michigan has investigated Universal hospitals in the state. Regulators with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs looked into allegations of patient mistreatment at Havenwyck and a second Universal hospital Forest View in Grand Rapids a Free Press investigation found.

Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show LARA officials investigated Havenwyck in 2016 after an 11-year-old boy crashed into the frame of a bed that had no mattress breaking two of his top front teeth. LARA also investigated allegations that Forest View hospital had violated its own policies when it failed to report a patient's claim that she had been sexually assaulted.

Advocates for mentally ill people say they are concerned the new Universal-run Beaumont hospital will try to fill its beds with patients who have health insurance potentially leaving vulnerable uninsured patients without care. They say they're also concerned the hospital will make decisions about which patients to admit based on their diagnosis prognosis and past behavior.

Tom Watkins who used to lead the Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority expressed concerns about the Beaumont-Universal tie-up. Provided by Tom Watkins

Public patients are often poor people who have been referred for hospitalization by community mental health programs.

Watkins a former mental health director for the state said it is ""mind-boggling"" that the state has already given various approvals to the new hospital considering Universal's alleged track record. Those approvals include a state building permit and permission to transfer and add beds to the hospital.

""It just doesn't add up"" Watkins said.

Reinstein who retired from the Mental Health Association in Michigan last year said that private psychiatric hospitals and the psychiatric units of community hospitals ""don't want the so-called more difficult cases and don't want cases when there's no ready reimbursement mechanism.

""They don't want to take people with very complex cases or a history of acting out and a private for-profit new hospital isn't likely to be any different in that regard.""

Mark Reinstein former CEO of the Mental Health Association in Michigan standing outside in Ann Arbor Mich. on Tuesday April 13 2021. Antranik Tavitian Detroit Free Press

Reinstein said he has little confidence that LARA will provide the proper oversight ""based on my experience in other mental health matters."" LARA which issued the hospital a construction permit last year will be in charge of licensing and overseeing the facility.

Universal said in a statement that the facility will address the state’s growing unmet need for behavioral health services and will provide ""compassionate professional care to all patients. …""

The Beaumont-Universal tie-up has supporters.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania in November 2013 If a Medicare patient directly requests a discharge he or she is often threatened with involuntary commitment even though there is no medical basis to do so.

Robert Sheehan CEO of the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan said that while the claims in the lawsuits are troubling Universal's three mental health hospitals in Michigan — Havenwyck Forest View and Cedar Creek in St. Johns — have good reputations.

""At this point the issues seem to be lodged within their corporate offices and not from what we can see within their local hospital operations. Given this we will not be opposing this expansion"" Sheehan said in an email.

Universal is one of the country's largest health care providers. It had revenues of $11.6 billion in 2020 has about 89000 employees operates 26 acute care hospitals and 334 behavioral health facilities including locations in the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico according to the company.

When Universal settled the lawsuits in 2020 the company denied wrongdoing saying the agreement did not ""constitute a finding of improper conduct or failure to provide appropriate care and treatment. ... UHS is pleased to have resolved this matter to avoid future distractions and the high costs of litigation while ensuring that our focus remains steadfast on providing excellent care to our patients and their families.""

In a statement to the Free Press Universal said providers are often faced with the difficult but ""economically sensible choice"" of settling such cases even if the allegations are denied.

Doctors oppose tie-up

Beaumont said it sought input from its doctors. But several veteran Beaumont psychiatrists told the Free Press they were not consulted about Beaumont's plans to let Universal take over their units. Others said they objected but were overruled.

""They didn't even ask us"" Dr. Sabiha Omar who has overseen the psychiatric unit at Beaumont Farmington Hills since 2019 said in a February interview with the Free Press. ""We were told.""

She said Beaumont has also not been forthcoming about whether employees will still have their jobs after the move. She said she has chosen not to work at the new hospital.

Omar said her patients who are 55 and older often need medical help from other specialists in the hospital given their ages and acute health conditions. In her hospital these patients can be moved out of her unit into hospice care or a general medical floor when necessary.

Treating these senior patients in a psychiatric hospital in Dearborn won't be as seamless she said.

A former Beaumont psychiatrist echoed those concerns saying seriously ill patients could die waiting for an ambulance.

""The risk far outweighs the benefit"" said the doctor who the Free Press is not naming because the physician fears reprisal.

Psychiatric patients who realize they need to be hospitalized are already in a high state of trauma. Sometimes they hear voices or harm themselves another Beaumont psychiatrist said.

""They're fragile. A psychotic patient is dealing with horrible things inside their head"" the doctor said. The trip to Dearborn ""it adds another burden; it’s not good for them.""

Other Beaumont doctors also said they would prefer to have their psychiatric units remain in their communities and to have their patients in a hospital with other specialists.

Some were also critical of the conditions at Havenwyck run by Universal. In interviews two former staffers said the hospital has been understaffed prompting some patient complaints.

""They don't treat people well and it's not well run"" said a Beaumont psychiatrist who had a patient treated at Havenwyck. The patient the doctor said ""couldn't get good care.""

""It's not a healing environment. There's too much chaos"" said the doctor who asked to remain anonymous for job protection reasons.

Universal's Diane Henneman said Havenwyck ""always has and will continue to staff appropriately to serve patient needs. ... We vehemently disagree with the statements referenced; they mischaracterize the hospital environment and operations.""

Doctors opposed Beaumont's plans with Universal in staff meetings and said at least one of them tried to talk about the issues with Dr. David Wood Beaumont Health's chief medical officer but he ""would not listen to us"" a doctor said in an interview.

In a statement Wood said: “I met with many clinical leaders to discuss our mental health strategy and we incorporated the feedback we received into the process of enhancing our mental health services and programs.”

Another psychiatrist said Beaumont has shared few details about how the new hospital will be run.

""The nursing staff is upset. They're not sure of their future with UHS not sure where they’re going to land"" the psychiatrist said. ""We've lost people to COVID layoffs. The remaining employees are asking what is going to happen to their positions.""

Construction continues on a new mental health hospital off Rotunda Drive in Dearborn which is a partnership between Beaumont Health and Universal Health Services on Tuesday April 20 2021. Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press

Another Beaumont psychiatrist said moving psychiatric patients into their own hospital away from other patients and specialists goes ""against the grain of psychiatry which is to integrate it into the other parts of medicine.""

Psychiatric care the doctor said ""should be in a hospital that offers a range of services"" and should remain in the local community.

The new hospital the doctor said is a ""throwback to the old days"" when psychiatric patients were put ""far away.""

Dr. Robert Trestman a psychiatrist and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine said integrating psychiatric patients in a larger hospital with other specialists is important especially when patients are frail or elderly.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Michigan in June 2019 ... several of the physicians at Havenwyck have standing orders for new/unadmitted patients to be started on drugs despite never having been examined since these physicians do not want the bother of being contacted while on call.

But there are other reasons too he said. Psychiatric patients who misuse drugs may have infectious diseases heart conditions or sepsis and may need treatment for both their medical and psychiatric illnesses at the same time. Psychiatric patients who are depressed may not be taking care of themselves and that only worsens medical conditions like diabetes.

""You get the depression under control and you're able to get the diabetes under control"" Trestman said.

In its statement Beaumont said small mental health units in large medical-surgical hospitals cannot provide the specialized services patients need. The new hospital Beaumont said will be capable of treating children teens seniors and patients with various distinct diagnoses such as depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

""The needs of mental health patients vary by their diagnosis and a larger more sophisticated facility will better serve their needs"" Odom said in her statement.

And like Beaumont another of Michigan's largest hospital systems is also joining with a for-profit publicly traded company to build a new psychiatric hospital.

The Henry Ford Health System and Acadia Healthcare Co. announced in December a joint venture to build a 192-bed hospital next to its West Bloomfield campus.

Henry Ford said construction and equipment are expected to cost $50 million which Acadia is covering. The hospital is expected to open in late 2022.

Henry Ford said it will move inpatient services from two of its locations in Ferndale and Mount Clemens to the new hospital. But it will keep inpatient psychiatric units at its hospitals in Wyandotte and Jackson.

Tennessee-based Acadia has also come under scrutiny from the Justice Department for running an alleged billing scheme involving seven drug treatment centers in West Virginia. The Justice Department announced in May 2019 it had settled the case for $17 million calling it the largest such settlement in the state's history.

Acadia said the government's civil investigation in West Virginia involved ""technical and complex state and federal billing and coding procedures governing reimbursement for lab testing services."" It also noted that there were ""zero allegations or issues identified with the level or quality of care provided to patients or the medical necessity of such care.""

Trestman said he is concerned about the trend of community hospital systems joining with for-profit companies to handle their psychiatric patients.

These hospital operators could cut costs by hiring fewer nurses or using more nurse practitioners and physician assistants in place of psychiatrists he said. Hospitals can also find ways of refusing to admit the sickest most difficult patients by saying they are too violent too agitated he added.

""The risks are very significant"" Trestman said.

State investigates claims

In Michigan LARA has investigated complaints against Universal and Beaumont. According to documents released under an open records request the department found more serious violations at Universal than at Beaumont in recent years.

A Free Press review of records provided by LARA showed the department found just one justified complaint against a Beaumont psychiatric unit over a five-year period ending in late 2020.

The LARA investigators concluded that a staff member at Beaumont Farmington Hills in 2018 used an antipsychotic medication on an 85-year-old patient with depression and bipolar disorder to get her to go to sleep. That approach LARA said violates rules against using chemical restraints for staff convenience. LARA did not require the hospital to take action to resolve the case.

At Universal hospitals LARA found four justified complaints over the same five-year period.

In one case state regulators determined that Forest View hospital had violated its own policies when it failed to report to law enforcement a patient's claim that she had been sexually assaulted. Despite that finding LARA did not require corrective action documents show.

But in other cases LARA took action against Universal's hospitals.

The department investigated Havenwyck after receiving two complaints that an 11-year-old boy with bipolar disorder had been injured in 2016.

Havenwyck Hospital in Auburn Hills on Tuesday April 13 2021. Eric Seals Detroit Free Press

LARA reviewed security camera footage of the room where staffers had taken the boy to be restrained. The patient LARA said ""was trying to escape staff and attempting to hit them."" LARA said two staff members restrained the boy at the foot of the bed by holding his arms. The boy struggled and ""suddenly propelled himself forward landing face first on the bed.""

His face struck the hard frame. Two of his upper front teeth broke off.

LARA interviewed the boy who said: ""Two people pushed me down on the bed in the quiet room with no mattress on the bed and I smashed my teeth on the bed frame.""

But one of the employees a nurse told LARA that the boy was angry and had thrown a mattress at two staff members. The nurse described the boy as ""out of control and we couldn't get him to settle down."" The nurse said they were trying to get him on the bed so another nurse could give him a shot to calm him.

""When we let him up after the shot I saw two little teeth and he said 'Look what you did to my teeth' "" the nurse told LARA.

During the investigation a LARA official observed the mattress on the bed and described it as an ""exercise-camping"" type of mattress that wasn't contoured to fit the frame and slid off the bed when touched.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Michigan in June 2019 Once admitted patients are chemically restrained using medications that are not necessarily prescribed upon an actual physician’s examination.

LARA concluded that the hospital had violated federal standards for failing to ensure the bed in the seclusion room was safe.

As part of its corrective plan with the state the hospital agreed to retrain all of its nurses focusing on proper restraint techniques.

Universal in a statement to the Free Press called it ""an unfortunate accident"" and noted that Havenwyck used the incident to ""conduct additional training with our staff on restraint holds.""

LARA also investigated how Universal's Forest View handled a claim by a 52-year-old patient who reported she had been sexually assaulted by two employees. Forest View officials never reported the claim to authorities as required by hospital policy LARA found.

The next day the patient called her sister who contacted law enforcement.

""Patient wanted to call 911 but called her sister and had her sister call the police to investigate the alleged assaults. She was tearful talking about it"" according to a hospital social worker's report.

Two officers from the sheriff's department spoke with the patient who told them ""she had been sexually assaulted by two male staff on two separate occasions"" according to a Forest View nurse's note obtained by LARA. Records of the state investigation provided to the Free Press do not include any findings from law enforcement about the patient's claim.

LARA's report said the hospital later investigated and concluded that the allegations made by the patient could not be substantiated. The patient suffered a variety of illnesses including bipolar disorder schizophrenia major depressive disorder agitation psychosis auditory and visual hallucinations.

The hospital's CEO who was not identified by name in the investigative report told LARA: ""It should have been reported to the police (on) our side rather than the client's.""

According to the CEO every staff member received training on how to report allegations of abuse. But when LARA asked for documentation the hospital merely provided minutes of a staff meeting at which there was no apparent training. In its statements to the Free Press Universal did not respond to a question about the training.

According to records from LARA the department took no action against Forest View.

Whistleblowers sound alarm

The allegations of wrongdoing against Universal are the result of nearly a decade's worth of lawsuits filed by insiders at the company.

Troy lawyer Shereef Akeel Shereef Akeel

The whistleblower lawsuits were filed under the federal False Claims Act which permits private parties to sue on behalf of the federal government and to share in any settlement money.

Experts say these cases are filed under seal to allow the Justice Department to quietly investigate the claims for 60 days. The government can request extensions until it makes a decision on how to proceed: It can intervene ask the judge to dismiss the case or allow the whistleblower lawyers to proceed. While these start as civil cases the investigations can lead to criminal charges.

Shereef Akeel a Troy lawyer who specializes in employment law called the provisions under the false claims law ""the one opportunity where a citizen can assist the government to prosecute fraud. It’s a great weapon to combat corruption.""

Mark Schlein with the law firm of Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman filed a case on behalf of a whistleblower in May 2012 against Universal's River Point Behavioral Health. Mark Schlein

Eighteen of the Universal cases were settled together with Universal agreeing to pay $117 million in penalties to the federal government and several states including roughly $2.4 million to Michigan. (A 19th case was settled separately for $5 million.)

Erin Campbell a Cincinnati lawyer who represents whistleblowers called the large number of Universal lawsuits and the size of the settlement “extraordinarily rare” for cases involving allegations of billing for medically unnecessary care. She said the Justice Department’s decision to intervene in the 19 lawsuits suggests it believed taxpayers had been harmed and were owed millions of dollars.

David Kwok associate professor at the University of Houston Law Center who researches the False Claims Act said the government’s case against Universal involved a complicated investigation that was part of a larger effort by the Justice Department.

“This is unfortunately a small piece of that huge chunk of health care fraud that’s been growing over the past few decades” Kwok said in an interview.

Mark Schlein with the law firm of Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman filed the first of the cases on behalf of a whistleblower in May 2012 in federal court in Florida against Universal's River Point Behavioral Health. The whistleblower he represented alleged the Jacksonville hospital held patients improperly to exhaust their insurance benefits; admitted patients based on their insurance; billed for unnecessary services; and had group therapy sessions run by interns unlicensed staff and even former patients.

Schlein said he wished he could call the allegations the most outrageous but ""they're all too common when you begin investigating large-scale health care fraud.""

Schlein said the settlements did not require Universal to admit wrongdoing but added ""I can probably suggest a company won't agree to pay $117 million for allegations it believes are false and untrue.""

As part of the settlement Universal Health agreed to enter into a corporate integrity agreement until 2025 with the inspector general's office of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania in November 2017 ... routinely “overstuffs” its facility by adding cots which allow it to exceed the approved number of patients that it serves ... As a consequence patients at UHS’ Roxbury facility have a high number of inappropriate outcomes including sexual misconduct ...

Under the agreement Universal must hire an independently selected monitor which will assess the company's protections for its mental health patients and report to the inspector general. In addition an independent organization will do yearly reviews of the claims Universal's inpatient behavioral health facilities submit to the federal government for reimbursement.

""Hopefully it will have a positive effect on people using (Universal) and other psychiatric services. If we've improved the care a little bit we’ve accomplished a lot"" Schlein said.

But this is not the first time Universal has been under the oversight of a federal watchdog.

When Schlein filed his case in 2012 Universal's South Texas Health System was already under a corporate integrity agreement. The Justice Department alleged the system paid doctors illegally to refer patients to hospitals within the group.

The hospital system agreed to more stringent federal oversight and to pay $27.5 million to settle the whistleblower case.

Back in Michigan two whistleblowers accused Universal's Havenwyck Hospital in Auburn Hills in 2019 of routinely failing to provide medically appropriate care.

Their suit in U.S. District Court in Detroit claimed Havenwyck did not have the staff medicine personal protection equipment and services to adequately treat some of its sickest patients.

Havenwyck Hospital in Auburn Hills on Tuesday April 13 2021. Eric Seals Detroit Free Press

As a result the lawsuit alleged public funds were misused and there were medical emergencies and patient deaths.

The lawsuit identified one of those who died as J.Y. It said the patient exceeded the hospital's 350-pound weight limit by almost 50 pounds.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Georgia in February 2019 Georgia hospital staffers employed by Defendants UHS and Anchor routinely injected patients with powerful sedative drugs as a form of chemical restraint of the patient and as a form of discipline for the patients.

She was known for being violent with staff on previous stays at Havenwyck. During her final stay the woman attacked one of the doctors and was found dead in her room five days later the suit said.

According to the death notification that the hospital filed with the state Havenwyck received the patient from Detroit Receiving Hospital. She had been found walking with no shoes on and unable to care for her basic needs.

Based on the death notification the Oakland County medical examiner was able to identify her as Jane Young who died in July 2018 of cardiovascular disease and obesity. The Free Press was unable to reach any of Young's survivors. The lawsuit alleged her stay in Havenwyck was fraudulent because the hospital should not have admitted her because it did not have the staff and resources to care for her properly.

The lawsuit identified another patient who died at Havenwyck as K.J. It said she was admitted in January 2018 without a reliable medical or psychiatric history and her guardian was not contacted for further information.

The lawsuit said her medical status and history were unclear to Havenwyck during her hospitalization. The lawsuit said she did not attend any groups or participate in active treatment.

She was found unresponsive in her room six days after she was admitted and died. K.J. is Kathy Jawor 57 who died of heart disease according to the medical examiner.

Three years after his sister died at Havenwyck John Jawor of Novi said he is still puzzled about her death.

Kathy Jawor 57 of Dearborn Heights died January 2018 while she was a patient at Havenwyck Hospital in Auburn Hills Mich. John Jawor

Kathy Jawor had schizophrenia and had been in and out of mental institutions in her adult life. During her last days she was initially admitted at Garden City Hospital before transferring to Havenwyck. Over the next week John Jawor said he and his sister talked over the phone. During one of those conversations he recalled she pleaded: ""Get me out of here."" She had said similar things during earlier hospitalizations.

""She sounded drugged"" Jawor said. That was routine too during her hospitalizations.

He took her clothes and toiletries to Havenwyck but said he wasn't allowed to see her because he hadn't come during visiting hours.

Then he got the call: Kathy who he said weighed 250 pounds had been found sitting on the floor at the hospital. And his sister couldn't be revived.

""Why was she sitting on the floor?"" he remembers thinking to himself. ""It struck me as really strange. ... It raised questions in my mind.""

It raised questions he said because he had called 911 to help Kathy who was severely obese get off the floor of her home in Dearborn Heights on a couple of occasions.

He said the doctors who treated Kathy were inclined to try different drugs different levels of drugs and different combinations of drugs.

The doctors like the families of these patients seemed to be ""grasping at straws"" in their treatment Jawor said. ""They don't have all the answers.""

He has his regrets too.

""I wished I had loved her as she was. I should have just loved her where she was instead of always trying to heal her to fix her when it was out of my hands"" Jawor said.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Georgia in February 2019 The so-called “booty juice” was comprised of the anti-psychotic drugs Haldol or Mellaril . Once patients are given the booty Juice injections as a form of discipline or restraint they are then secluded in a secured room where they are monitored by cameras by non-physician staff ...

At Havenwyck whistleblowers said there were other problems.

Upon admission patients were supposed to receive a 50-minute psychological exam from trained doctors but at times they received less than 10 minutes the lawsuit alleged.

Those assessments were so cursory that they failed to include weight life-threatening illnesses and the patients' current prescriptions the suit said. Some patients also did not receive meaningful physician care and did not receive group therapy the suit alleged. Whistleblowers claimed that patients were “being warehoused rather than treated medically.”

The lawsuit also alleged the hospital handled patients' medications improperly. It claimed patients were taken off their current medication and nearly all were put on psychotropic drugs ""within the first day of seeing a psychiatrist including patients who do not appear to require inpatient care at all.”

""In short patients are being chemically restrained without proper justification and in violation of the Michigan Mental Health Code as a means of extending stays on Medicare or Medicaid time"" the suit said.

The 2019 suit which was settled with 18 others was filed by two whistleblowers Sandra McLauchlin who was in nursing management and Christina Varner a charge nurse. Their lawyer Sarah Prescott declined comment.

Universal said Havenwyck denies the allegations in the lawsuit.

At Forest View Hospital in Grand Rapids former employee Heidi Parent-Leonard accused the hospital of defrauding federal insurance programs.

Excerpt from Universal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Michigan in June 2019 ... patients are being chemically restrained without proper justification and in violation of the Michigan Mental Health Code as a means of extending stays on Medicare or Medicaid time.

Parent-Leonard a case manager at the hospital for two years alleged in court papers that the hospital admitted patients who did not need inpatient care and that one of the doctors Dr. Jahandar Saifollahi improperly billed for services that were not provided and referred patents to himself and the hospital in violation of the law.

Dr. Saifollahi told the Free Press that he did not handle billing Forest View did.

""I never billed anything for them"" he said.

Saifollahi a defendant in the suit said he settled the case but did not admit to wrongdoing. Universal said an investigation was conducted and the hospital ended its relationship with Saifollahi.

According to a news release by Parent-Leonard's lawyers announcing the settlement last summer Saifollahi and his medical practice settled claims for $85000.

Parent-Leonard said in a statement that she was stunned by the lack of services patients received at Forest View. She said Saifollahi would line patients up in the hallway and spend 5 minutes talking to each one after another.

""Nobody was getting the help they needed"" Parent-Leonard said in the news release. (Reached by the Free Press an attorney for Parent-Leonard said she was not available for an interview.)

She said in her statement she hoped that the hospital and Universal ""'will learn from these lawsuits and foster a culture of quality respect and honest dealings with their patients.""

Thousands of small businesses are attempting to come back after a very difficult year because of COVID-19. Restaurants and businesses in fitness service and entertainment were hurt the most.

Online businesses like Amazon had record sales. Big-box stores like Walmart did very well. But small businesses faced arduous restrictions by governors and mayors that have essentially put them out of business for over a year.

Most of these businesses have tried just to keep their heads above water. A jobs report earlier this month came out with an alarming result of only 266000 jobs created. The expectation was 1 million.

The results are a warning sign for all small businesses. There are multiple factors crushing small businesses today. Although there are millions of job openings across the country businesses are having a hard time finding people to fill those jobs.

Small businesses are having a particularly hard time finding employees. With their small margins they have a hard time competing for employees with companies like Walmart.

As you drive around town you will see ""Help wanted"" signs everywhere. First the biggest factor: People are making more on unemployment than what they would make by working.

The federal government is paying $300 in enhanced benefits. These enhanced benefits are scheduled to continue until September. President Joe Biden was asked “Do you believe enhanced unemployment benefits had any effect on diminishing return to work in some categories?”

The president's reply was “No nothing measurable.”

What American in their right mind would not recognize that giving people more money to stay at home was the biggest reason for people not returning to work?

The next factor is inflation. With the federal government's out-of-control printing of money prices of goods and services will soar. Small businesses will have to weigh how much to increase the price of goods and services and still retaining customers.

This will lower the number of employees a business has while still expecting the same work performance. The last two are Democrats wanting to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour and also raise the taxes on business.

Will your favorite restaurant still be in business in a year or two?

IPS' COVID-19 funds should prioritize equitable funding for students of color

Indianapolis Public Schools is poised to become a leader in public education. At a time when our communities are engaging in difficult and necessary conversations about race privilege and opportunity we have notably diverse leadership in a school district where more than 70% are people of color.

I admire Aleesia Johnson’s leadership as the first Black female IPS superintendent alongside that of School Board President Evan Hawkins. Indy residents are tired of the status quo and are ready for meaningful sustainable action that actually serves students and communities of color.

Last summer thanks to the tireless leadership of Pat Payne IPS adopted a “Racial Equity Mindset Commitment & Action Policy” which promises our community that IPS will eliminate the “policies practices attitudes and cultural messages” that widen the achievement and opportunity gaps for children of color in our city. I applaud the district for this bold declaration but I know the work has only just begun.

The federal government is allocating over $200 million in COVID-19 relief funds for IPS. This means that we have a unique opportunity to implement the Racial Equity Mindset Commitment & Action Policy in a way that significantly improves our public education system for marginalized students. We must prioritize:

Access to mental health supports to help them process trauma.

A concrete plan to recruit and retain teachers of color.

Literacy programming to ensure that every student can read at grade level or higher.

Most importantly we must share resources equitably across all schools serving IPS students especially those schools serving majority black and brown students.

The commitment that IPS administration and School Board has to our community is evident. We all benefit from a strong and inclusive public school system. I am excited to support IPS as they implement their vision for a just and equitable district.

Critical race theory debate reinforces belief in public education

IndyStar columnist James Briggs’ recent article about the controversial topic discussed at a Carmel school board meeting critical racial theory brought a question of definition and my feelings about schools and the topic.

I like many people had never heard of that subject but as a lifelong educator and an avid believer in public schools I follow Indiana education stories closely.

I read the entire article and while I cannot understand most of the anger and angst caused by the hiring of a diversity officer or the perception that an ideology of hate based on race will be taught in classes I did pick up on a comment that hits home with what I have said for years.

“A critical race analysis will ask 'Why is there only one person of color in this room?'”

The quote reinforces my belief in public education and what it can do for our children.

As the move for choice and charter schools continues and public schools receive less and less support our children can attend a school that is more and more unlike what real life contains. It is unfortunate we live in world where we must hire a diversity officer but such is the world we live in. And I applaud those who want to give all students and teachers a real view of our world.

Public schools can and do make strides toward reminding our children we are all human beings. Different yes. But we can learn to get along and appreciate that what makes us human are our differences as well as our similarities.

I am a doctor. Here's why I support 'Medicare for All'

As a physician and resident of West Lafayette I commend the West Lafayette City Council for unanimously passing a resolution Feb. 1 calling for the national universal health care program known as “Medicare for All.”

This plan currently being considered in Congress would greatly increase the delivery of needed health services to most Americans.

The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the need for a national universal health care system.

The current health care system with many people uninsured high copayments and deductibles and mental health services often not covered cannot address these problems.

Can we afford better health care? Yes the financing plans for Medicare for All will reduce healthcare costs for most Americans. Cutting down on the administrative costs and burdensome paperwork in the current system will help more people get coverage and expand services.

As a physician I will be able to spend more time with my patients instead of hours on my laptop meeting the charting requirements of our billers.

I see patients who delay care because they have no health insurance or have high deductibles.

It is time for us to contact Indiana members of Congress to support Medicare for All.

As a developing country Bangladesh struggles to provide adequate healthcare for such a large number of people. The problem particularly brings challenges for people from rural and marginalized communities who often cannot access quality health services. To combat this issue the Surjer Hashi Network has been established. Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) it is a network of hundreds of health facilities throughout the country. The facilities bring free or reduced-cost healthcare to low-income populations in Bangladesh while simultaneously bringing the country closer to achieving universal healthcare.

Healthcare in Bangladesh

Despite Bangladesh’s current struggles to provide a reasonable level of healthcare for its citizens the country has made significant progress over the past few decades. Certain indicators have seen improvements such as maternal and infant mortality. Furthermore the rate of vaccinations for children has increased dramatically with the percentage of tuberculosis vaccinations for children under 1 increasing from 2% in 1985 to 99% in 2009. While the developments are a good sign Bangladesh still faces many challenges in maintaining its healthcare system. For instance the country suffers from a severe shortage of healthcare workers. As of 2009 only about one-third of the country’s facilities have at least 75% of qualified staff working in healthcare and 36% of health worker positions are vacant.

The ineptitude of Bangladesh’s governmental structure and the inability of its institutions to carry out its policies cause problems. The healthcare system is concentrated in urban areas even though 70% of the population lives in rural areas. Meanwhile careless management obstructs the allocation of resources. Healthcare workers suffer from high turnover and absenteeism while maintenance of facilities is poor. Meanwhile rural Bangladeshis often forego formal healthcare due to a lack of access in the communities. As a result only a quarter of the population uses public healthcare.

The Surjer Hashi Network

USAID backs the Surjer Hashi Network of health clinics aiming at serving low-income and other underserved communities in Bangladesh. With 399 facilities nationwide the network serves at least 16% of the population. In just a five-year period USAID helped the Surjer Hashi Network prevent 2000 maternal deaths and 10000 child deaths. The facilities provide communities with proper healthcare in remote and underserved areas. Rural women in particular have benefited as the Surjer Hashi Network of clinics provides for reproductive health and child care.

Universal Healthcare in Bangladesh

In 2018 USAID started the Advancing Universal Health Coverage (AUHC) program which has allowed the Surjer Hashi Network to remain operable in the long term. The program has consolidated the hundreds of clinics in the network into a centrally managed organization and it has introduced new business models aimed at keeping costs down and expanding health services. The efforts will ensure that clinics in the Surjer Hashi Network will be financially independent while providing high-quality and affordable healthcare for the disadvantaged.

As its name suggests the AUHC’s goal is to achieve universal healthcare in Bangladesh. Through the Surjer Hashi Network USAID is ensuring that Bangladesh can provide healthcare coverage for as many people as possible with healthcare facilities that are accessible in rural areas as well.

“What we are celebrating here this evening is truly a remarkable achievement. Dominica has been able to maintain 95 per cent or more coverage of ante natal care and skilled attendance at birth” Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit told the ceremony at which the World Health Organisation (WHO) certification was made.

He said that the island had also achieved 95 per cent or more coverage of HIV and syphilis screening of pregnant women zero incidence of parental HIV per 1000 lives of genital syphilis.

“As a result there has been no recorded cases of mother to child transmission of HIV and syphilis in the Commonwealth of Dominica over the past four years’ Skerrit said adding that the “achievements of the dual elimination targets has additional positive implications as it contributes for Dominica to reach other sustainable developing goals.

He said these SDGs include the reduction of maternal and child mortality universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services and universal health care coverage while contributing to the reduction in inequalities.

The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) said Dominica has joined seven other Caribbean countries that have received the dual validation “demonstrating continuing regional progress against the two diseases.”

The Dominica-born WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr Carissa F Etienne said: “Dominica’s journey to this ambitious achievement represents a cumulation of years of expanding the capacity of its primary care services to address communicable diseases and adopting harmonized and integrated approaches to improving the health outcomes for women and their children within maternal and child health services.”

WHO/PAHO Representative for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean Dr Yitades Gebre highlighted the goal of the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV and syphilis.

Gebre said: “Today we are celebrating the validation of the achievement of mother to child transmission of HIV and syphilis in the Commonwealth of Dominica. The goal of the elimination programme is to ensure that mother to child transmission…is controlled and reduced to very low level.”

She said this milestone “marks the beginning of the end of HIV epidemic in children” here while Health Minister Dr Irvine McIntyre said Dominica had been able to meet all the criteria required by the international health agency in order to receive the certification.

“The Ministry of Health is aware of the need to maintain the elimination status when the re-evaluation is done in the next two years and the ministry pledges to do all in its capacity to achieve this” he added.

PAHO said that while Dominica received the certificate for elimination during the ceremony on Friday the country was recommended by WHO for certification last September.

New HIV infections among children in the Caribbean declined by nearly 40 per cent between 2010 and 2019 – the year that the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and Congenital Syphilis in Latin America and the Caribbean was launched PAHO said.

During that period it said the number of cases declined from 3400 to 1500.

PAHO said reported cases of congenital syphilis in the Caribbean are now at 9.6 cases per 100000 newborns well below the goal of no more than 50 cases per 100000 newborns.

PAHO said the seven other Caribbean countries and territories that have received the dual certification are Cuba in 2015 and Anguilla Antigua and Barbuda Bermuda Cayman Islands Montserrat and St Kitts-Nevis in 2017.

Director for the Caribbean Sub-regional Office of UNAIDS Dr James Guwani said that Dominica’s success brings the country and region a step closer to ending AIDS.

“Dominica’s achievement in ensuring that its children are born free of HIV is truly inspiring and is testament to the combined strength and leadership of government civil society activists and communities living with and affected by HIV” he said adding “by putting people first we can end the AIDS epidemic.”

UNICEF’s Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean Jean Gough said “from now on every child will be born free of HIV and congenital syphilis in Dominica. No mother will transmit these diseases to her children. Today is a moment of pride for the country but also a source of hope for many others in Latin America and the Caribbean.”

Director of the Pan Caribbean Partnership against HIV and AIDS (PANCAP) Dr Rosmond Adams described the elimination as remarkable.

Adams said: “This is a commitment by Dominica that no child is born with HIV or congenital syphilis” she said. “It is also an indication of the country’s commitment and the hard work of the health care providers to reduce new HIV infections which is a key strategy towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vaW4tZGVwdGgvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzA1LzE2L2JlYXVtb250LWhlYWx0aC1mYXJtaW5ndG9uLWhpbGxzLWhvc3BpdGFsLXBzeWNoaWF0cmljLXBhdGllbnQtZGVhdGhzLzcwMDYxNzkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dozens of elderly psychiatric patients die at Beaumont hospital,"Your subscription supports:

As the United States struggled to meet demands for fuel in the early 2000s Motiva Enterprises decided to double the capacity of its oil refinery in the Gulf Coast city of Port Arthur on the Texas-Louisiana border. The refinery had been in Port Arthur for as long as Texas has pumped oil; in 1902 a year after the historic Spindletop discovery in nearby Beaumont led to the state’s first oil boom the company that would later become Texaco built the refinery on 25 acres of land. Over the next century the region became a central hub for the industry’s refineries and petrochemical plants.

By 2006 the refinery was owned by Motiva Enterprises a joint venture between Shell Oil and Aramco a Saudi company. The company proposed to expand its production to more than 600000 barrels a day which would make it the largest refinery in the country and one of the biggest in the world. But first Motiva wanted tax breaks so it turned to a nascent Texas economic development program known as Chapter 313 which allows industry to solicit school districts for lucrative property tax breaks. Known for its place in the Texas tax code Chapter 313 offers huge tax incentives for major industrial projects in exchange for the company’s promise to bring long-term investment and high-paying jobs.

The Motiva deal marked the biggest Chapter 313 deal since its creation. With the promise of much-needed revenue for its students Port Arthur Independent School District officials eagerly approved the project. The district would in essence tax one of the world’s biggest refineries as if it were worth just $30 million. In return the school district would get an infusion of crucial cash. It was a win-win.

By the time the expansion was completed in 2012 Motiva had spent $10 billion and the refinery’s market value soon ballooned to $3.5 billion. Over one decade the Chapter 313 deal with Port Arthur ISD had lightened Motiva’s local tax liability to the tune of $240 million.

Then just as the tax breaks expired in 2018 Motiva suddenly announced that it was contesting the refinery’s appraised value of $3.5 billion saying the structure and its contents were actually worth just $1.5 billion. Motiva sued the Jefferson County Appraisal District claiming the refinery was drastically over-valued compared to other refineries in the area. Thanks to a team of high-powered lawyers and seemingly endless supply of funds for legal fees Motiva ultimately forced the outmatched appraisal district to settle saving tens of millions of dollars in property taxes in one fell swoop and leaving the Port Arthur school district in crisis: Port Arthur ISD which serves 8000 predominantly Black and Hispanic and low-income students is dependent on property tax generated by the refineries and chemical plants that loom over its schools and homes. The Motiva refinery alone accounts for roughly half its tax base.

State lawmakers created the Chapter 313 program 20 years ago in response to fears that high property taxes were preventing corporations from pursuing large-scale projects in Texas. That fear was later found to be untrue but the program has been wildly popular. As of 2019 there were 509 active deals that will deliver a total of $10.8 billion in tax breaks to corporations. Critics say that the program amounts to a wasteful trough for costly corporate tax subsidies that starves the state of revenue that could be used to fund public schools and the program will soon cost taxpayers more than $1 billion a year according to the state comptroller. Still this session legislators from both political parties are scrambling to renew — and expand — the program before it expires at the end of 2022.

Chapter 313 deals are supposed to provide a big pay off for school districts — and the state at large — once big industrial investments return to the tax rolls. Using 313 data obtained from the state comptroller’s office the Texas Observer analyzed 71 projects in the manufacturing and wind sectors — which account for the vast majority of the program — that have reached the end of their tax breaks. Some projects met or exceeded their early projections. But for most other projects those estimates were much rosier than reality: Almost all the 55 wind projects overestimated what their projects’ value would be once tax breaks expired based on projections companies provided either in their initial applications or their earliest biennial filings after the deal was approved. 12 of the 16 manufacturing projects also undershot their earlier projections. While it’s normal for industrial properties to decline in value as facilities age projects with 313 deals have a knack for losing much more value than expected.

In some instances this is because powerful corporations like Motiva battled with local officials to drastically lower their property values before their tax abatements ended leaving school districts — and ordinary taxpayers — in a lurch. “Although we love Chapter 313 agreements it is not without difficulties” says Port Arthur ISD’s chief financial officer Phyllis Geans. She says it’s wrong for huge oil and gas corporations like Motiva to slip out of their tax liabilities once the program expires. After all it’s not like regular Texans are getting much of a break on their property taxes. “The value of property goes up on our homes. Why would the industries assume they should pay less?”

The threat of a drawn-out complex and expensive legal battle against big companies can often force local tax appraisers to cave. “Their pockets are a lot deeper” says Angela Bellard the chief appraiser for the Jefferson County Appraisal District which includes Port Arthur. The appraisal office reached a settlement with Motiva that knocked its taxable value for 2018 and 2019 down to about $1.5 billion roughly one-third less than what Motiva had initially projected would return to the rolls according to a 2010 filing.

To add insult to injury the settlement forced Port Arthur ISD to refund Motiva $8.5 million of property taxes it had already allocated to school programs. The blow was especially severe because the district had finally finished paying off $30 million in tax refunds to Valero after the San Antonio-based energy giant won several lawsuits that deflated the value of its properties in Jefferson County — including another Port Arthur refinery with a Chapter 313 deal.

Chapter 313 deals are typically low-risk high-reward ventures for school districts: Companies consider a large project and approach school district officials to see whether the district is willing to tax the company at a much lower rate than usual. In return the school district immediately starts collecting revenue and in 10 years will get the payoff from the project’s full taxable value. As well the state’s school finance formula covers any tax revenue that a district loses because of the agreement. Districts can also cut deals with the companies to get a substantial share of their savings known as supplemental payments. For Port Arthur ISD these deals have provided a financial boost. “With the availability of these funds the district has been able to provide much-needed assistance to parents students and staff for reading materials social services assistance purchase of band instruments uniforms and temporary employment” says Geans the district’s chief financial officer. “Over the years the district has also utilized the funds for other services such as offering full-day kindergarten when the state only funded half-days.”

The program has grown exponentially since it was enacted in 2011. From 2011 to 2019 the number of deals rose by 200%. Chapter 313 has earned notoriety for helping to lure big-ticket projects like a Toyota truck factory to San Antonio the Samsung semiconductor plant in Austin and most recently the Tesla factory in Del Valle. But the program has been the biggest boon to the state’s already-dominant energy industry — specifically oil and gas and wind generation.

The lion’s share of the program’s tax bounty — 60% —goes to refineries chemical plants liquified natural gas facilities and other fossil-fuel projects concentrated along the Gulf Coast. Oil and gas giants that have long bossed Texas like Exxon Mobil Chevron Phillips Dow Chemical and Enterprise Products Partners have each saved hundreds of millions in property taxes thanks to Chapter 313. Out on the plains of West Texas and the Panhandle huge commercial wind farms — mostly financed by multinational renewable energy firms — receive much of the remaining tax benefits.

While Chapter 313 deals are supposedly reserved for projects that wouldn’t otherwise be built in Texas the state Comptroller has said “it’s generally impossible to determine the factors that ultimately cause a company to make a final decision” and has rarely denied an application. Between 85 and 90% of the projects that got Chapter 313 deals would have gone forward regardless of the program according to one study from the University of Texas at Austin.

Through an open records request with the state comptroller we obtained data from all the Chapter 313 agreements active in 2019 that include estimates of each project’s cumulative investment and annual property value — including projections for how much a project will be worth when it returns to the rolls. Projects that are still years away from their tax breaks ending — some as far out as 2035 — tend to offer up rosy estimates of the value they will bring back to the rolls. The program’s track record makes those claims dubious though.

For example data from the 200 active manufacturing projects shows companies estimate that 50% of the projects’ total investment will return to the rolls at an average of 70% of peak taxable value. Of those manufacturing projects — most of which are in the oil and gas or petrochemical sectors — 16 have reached the end of their tax limitations. In the first year back on the tax rolls those projects were collectively worth $3.5 billion. That’s less than half of the $7 billion the projects were worth at their peak and just 20% of the $18 billion in total investment.

It’s not necessarily surprising that their value has tanked; structures and equipment tend to lose value as they age. But critics say handing out generous long-term tax breaks for projects is a central flaw of the program. “You’re giving up the first 10 years of [tax revenue] when it’s the highest value” says Nate Jensen a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies economic incentive programs. “You’re giving up tax dollars today in hopes of collecting tax dollars in year 11. It’s hard to make these numbers work.”

It’s even harder when a project’s value has deflated far more than anticipated.

Motiva inked its Chapter 313 deal with Port Arthur ISD amid a flurry of other oil and gas companies launching new projects in the area. Golden Pass LNG an affiliate of ExxonMobil got a deal in 2006 with Sabine Pass ISD — a tiny district that serves 375 students in the unincorporated coastal communities just south of Port Arthur — for a liquified natural gas terminal. The $900 million construction project was completed by 2010 and that year Golden Pass estimated that the project would reach $865 million in taxable value and stay at that level when it returned to the rolls in 2017. Instead the terminal reached an actual peak of $650 million and $356 million by the time the tax breaks ended.

In 2008 Total Petrochemicals signed a deal with nearby Port Neches-Groves ISD to upgrade its own refinery in Port Arthur. Total poured $2.7 billion into the project and by 2012 the refinery was worth more than half a billion dollars. But its value continuously fell in the remaining years of the agreement and the refinery went back back on the tax rolls at just $200 million — almost two-thirds less than its peak value and 8% of the initial investment.

This wasn’t the first time one of the district’s Chapter 313 projects took a dive. Port Neches-Groves signed one of the first Chapter 313 agreements with Sabina Petrochemicals in 2002. After reaching its peak value of $230 million in 2007 before falling to about $125 million in the final year of the abatement period. On its way back to the tax rolls Sabina sued the county appraiser and reached a settlement that lowered its value all the way down to $58 million.

The Chapter 313 program “provides many positive outcomes if the contracts and promises are honored. Sadly we often find that organizations choose to contest values and appeal those agreements” said Port Neches-Groves ISD Superintendent Mike Gonzales in an email to the Observer. “When that occurs school districts are placed at a disadvantage and must find creative ways to overcome budgeted shortfalls.” Still Port Neches-Groves currently has three other active agreements on the books including another with Total that are expected to bring the district $25 million in supplemental payments.

Dale Craymer president of the Texas Taxpayers & Research Association a corporate-funded think tank and leading proponent of Chapter 313 points out that many projects “actually under-forecast their taxable value.” Indeed a number of the manufacturing projects whose deals have ended performed better than initially promised including an Enterprise Products Partners hydrocarbon processing plant in Barbers Hill ISD that was worth $235 million after the tax breaks ended—almost $70 million more than originally projected.

*

There are few guardrails in the Chapter 313 program to ensure that projects actually pay off for the state. In 2013 the Legislature passed a measure requiring the Comptroller’s Office to report whether a project is “reasonably likely” to generate enough tax revenue over 25 years to offset the cost of a decade of tax breaks. However the test doesn’t apply to any of the projects in which agreements have already ended such as Motiva’s. Critics also say the test is almost impossible to fail and isn’t followed up on.

In the 2015 legislative session then-state Representative Drew Springer filed a bill to create some accountability for declining values. Wind farms which are also major users of Chapter 313 had proliferated in Springer’s slice of West Central Texas; his bill would have clawed back a project’s tax breaks if it returned to the rolls at less than 80% of its initial value.

These commercial wind farms lose far more of their value than other 313 projects. The 55 wind projects whose tax abatement period has ended returned to the rolls at a combined value of $3.3 billion just over 25% of the $12.6 billion of total investment and an average of about 35% of their maximum taxable value which was a combined $9.3 billion. In 2007 Borden County ISD gave a 313 deal to Bull Creek Wind LLC. In 2010 the company estimated the wind farm would come back on the rolls at about $100 million. Instead it was worth just $22 million. Of all the wind projects this was the steepest decline in value. Still the company netted $6.5 million in tax benefits and Borden ISD got about 40% of the take. Dozens of other wind projects came back on the rolls worth tens or even hundreds of millions lower than estimated.

Springer’s clawback provision never made it to the floor.

Despite all the problems with Chapter 313 a coalition of strange bedfellows support the program. The vast majority of lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats alike — support it. The oil and gas industry and renewable energy advocates are united behind it too.

Representative Jim Murphy tried to extend and expand the program which will otherwise expire next year. Backed by the oil and gas industry and school districts Murphy’s House Bill 1556 would not only extend the program for another 10 years but also expand the scope of qualified projects by allowing companies to get Chapter 313 deals for simply renovating their plants.

That would allow wind farms and petrochemical facilities—which are frequently renovated and upgraded — that are already in Texas to receive Chapter 313 tax breaks in perpetuity. Murphy’s bill would also further explode the potential cost of the program: If passed the expanded program could cost school districts and the state nearly $50 billion over the next couple decades. Critics warned that HB1556 would essentially create a protected class of corporate taxpayers. “The bottom line is a two-tier property tax system in which large manufacturing properties receive long-term exemptions while smaller businesses and homeowners pick up the difference” Lavine said of the bill.

Murphy’s dramatic overhaul of 313 prompted bipartisan opposition in the Texas House and when it became clear that it would not pass on the House floor Monday Murphy effectively moved to kill his own bill. An alternative compromise bill that would extend the program for just two years allowing lawmakers to examine 313 in the interim passed the House last week and is headed to the Senate.

Valero’s successful suits created a budget crunch for Port Arthur ISD forcing the district to transport students in dilapidated buses and forgo teacher pay raises. It has also prompted a race to the bottom within the industry. County appraisal officials say it’s impossible to compare complex industrial properties like refineries and chemical plants because no two are the same but that hasn’t stopped the oil and gas industry — including Motiva — from successfully knocking billions of dollars in value off the tax rolls.

“Our company operates in a low-margin industry in which financial stewardship and effective cost management are critical” a Motiva spokesperson said in a written statement. “An in-depth review of our taxes revealed that the assessed value of our Port Arthur refinery was disproportionately higher than the assessed value of our industry peers. To help ensure long-term viability and success we made the decision to pursue a valuation adjustment for our refinery.”

After the settlement Superintendent Mark Porterie penned an op-ed blasting Motiva: “Ask yourselves ‘Why do you think companies choose not to pay their fair taxes in the city of Port Arthur?’” he wrote. “Why do we have to always accept what is offered to us even when we know the ‘morsels’ we receive are just to keep us quiet?”

For a program that was supposed to promote long-term investment the project was worth just 10% of its initial investment. In 2020 Motiva challenged its appraisal again and got its value further reduced to just $1 billion.

The district expects the company to challenge its value again this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJuei5jby5uei9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLzQ0MjYyNi91cy1jYXBpdGFsLXJ1bm5pbmctb3V0LW9mLXBldHJvbC1ldmVuLWFzLXBpcGVsaW5lLXJlY292ZXJzLWZyb20tYXR0YWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US capital running out of petrol even as pipeline recovers from attack,"Washington was running out of petrol on Friday even as the country's largest fuel pipeline network ramped up deliveries following a cyberattack and officials assured motorists supplies would return to normal soon.

The six-day Colonial Pipeline shutdown was the most disruptive cyberattack on record US news agency Reuters reported. The pipeline suffered a ransomware attack on 7 May and the company shut down operations.

Widespread panic buying continued in the US two days after the pipeline network restarted leaving filling stations across the US Southeast out of gas.

With more Americans taking road trips as pandemic restrictions ease pump prices are at their highest in years. The average national gasoline price has climbed to almost $3.04 the most expensive since October 2014 the American Automobile Association said.

As politicians discussed legislation to improve cyber defenses more gasoline stations shut down in the capital of the world's largest oil-consuming nation.

On Friday gas station outages in Washington climbed to 88 percent from 79 percent the day before tracking firm GasBuddy said. President Joe Biden assured motorists supplies should start returning to normal by this weekend.

""Most of these states/areas with outages have continued to see panicked buying which is likely a contributing factor to the slow-ish recovery thus far"" said GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan. ""It will take a few weeks.""

Colonial Pipeline announced late Thursday it had restarted its entire pipeline system which links refineries on the Gulf Coast to markets along the eastern seaboard.

On Friday evening the pipeline was shipping at normal rates based on shipper nominations a spokeswoman for Colonial said.

Some states experienced modest improvements but still had a lot of petrol outages. Some 65 percent of petrol stations in North Carolina were without fuel while in Virginia South Carolina and Georgia just under 50 percent were empty GasBuddy said.

Overall some 14144 petrol stations were experiencing outages down from a peak of 16200 GasBuddy said on Friday afternoon.

In Washington DC Dennis Li was stuck on Friday at a Sunoco petrol station that was out of fuel. He had tried to find petrol at four stations during the day with no luck.

""I'm running on empty to the point where I don't want to drive anymore"" said Li who is from Annapolis Maryland.

Minutes before the last of four stations ran out of petrol on River Road in the Washington suburb of Bethesda Maryland drivers were mostly calm. Still some were shocked to hear about the shortage.

Nicholas Swann had driven from his home in the Adams Morgan neighbourhood of Washington to Bethesda to get gasoline where the wait at the Shell station was 15 minutes.

""We were originally going to drive out to the beach this weekend but we don't know if we will because I can't make it there and back on one tank of gas"" Swann said.

Regulators refiners react to outage

The hacking group blamed for the attack DarkSide said it had hacked four other companies including a Toshiba subsidiary in Germany.

Colonial Pipeline has not determined how the initial breach occurred a spokeswoman said. The privately held company has focused on cleaning its networks restoring data and reopening the pipeline.

Colonial has not disclosed how much money the hackers were seeking or whether it paid. Bloomberg News reported that it paid nearly $5 million to hackers.

US lawmakers reintroduced legislation to support efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to secure pipelines and pipeline facilities from cyberattacks.

Washington issued shipping waivers allowing US refiners Valero Energy Corp and Citgo Petroleum to use foreign-flagged vessels to move gasoline and diesel from the US Gulf Coast to East Coast ports.

Gulf Coast refiners that send fuel to market through the Colonial Pipeline have cut production because they have been unable to move gasoline diesel and jet fuel through the line.

To speed delivery of fuel supplies four states and federal regulators relaxed restrictions on fuel truck drivers.

In Georgia one of the states worst hit by the outages fuel delivery companies struggled to get supplies to gasoline stations.

""I don't think we've seen the end of this by any stretch of the imagination"" said Deborah Latham 67 who owns petrol delivery company Georgia Tank Lines in Doraville Georgia. She and her 40 drivers serve fuel stations all around metro Atlanta including large sellers such as Kroger and QuikTrip.

""We're delivering what little fuel we can get our hands on"" Latham said. ""But it takes three times longer to get it because of the [tanker truck] lines and then at the stations cars don't get out of the way of our trucks so we can drop off fuel.""

Hay acuerdo para que la franquicia de la National Basketball League (NBA) pase a ser controlada por Álex Rodríguez exjugador de la Major League Baseball (MLB) y Marc Lore exdirector ejecutivo de Walmart en una operación valorada en 1.500 millones de dólares de acuerdo a The Athletic.

La documentación formal del acuerdo se firmará “en breve” una vez se haya conseguido el acuerdo de la Junta de Gobernadores de la NBA. El contrato incluirá además la venta de Minnesota Lynx franquicia de la Women's National Basketball Association (Wnba) y permitirá que Rodríguez y Lore sean propietarios cada uno del 50% del capital del grupo.

Ambos equipos propiedad de Glen Taylor desde 1994 han emitido un comunicado conjunto en el que informan de que “Glen Taylor ha llegado a un acuerdo con Marc Lore y Alex Rodríguez con respecto a la venta y futura propiedad de los Timberwolves y Lynx”. “La transacción se cerrará tras la aprobación de la liga comenzando la transición de propiedad y un nuevo capítulo de baloncesto de Minnesota Timberwolves y Lynx” concluye.

La venta por 1.500 millones de dólares supondrá un gran negocio para Taylor que compró la franquicia en 1994 por 88 millones de dólares para evitar que el equipo fuera trasladado a Nueva Orleans.

(Prohibida su reventa y archivo)

Seúl 15 de mayo (Yonhap) -- Las compañías surcoreanas de confitería han registrado fuertes ventas en el extranjero en 2020 gracias a la gran popularidad de la cultura del K-pop y la comida coreana en el exterior han dicho esta semana fuentes de la industria.

Las ventas en el extranjero del gigante de la industria Orion Corp. se situaron en aproximadamente 15 billones de wones (1.340 millones de dólares) el año pasado lo que representa el 655 por ciento de sus ventas brutas en general.

Las cifras del año pasado suponen un aumento frente a los 13 billones de wones (1.160 millones de dólares) registrados en 2019 12 billones de wones (1.071 millones de dólares) en 2018 y 106 billones de wones (946 millones de dólares) en 2017.

China fue el mayor mercado extranjero para Oricon ya que sus ventas en el país más poblado del mundo alcanzaron alrededor de 11 billones de wones (982 millones de dólares) superando el umbral del billón de wones (892 millones de dólares) por primera vez en tres años.

Tras China se situaron Vietnam con unas ventas de 292.000 millones de wones (260 millones de dólares) y Rusia con 89.000 millones de wones (79 millones de dólares).

El producto más vendido de Orion en el extranjero fue Choco Pie un pastel de malvavisco cubierto con chocolate. Las ventas del producto emblemático en el extranjero fueron de 381.400 millones de wones (340 millones de dólares) el año pasado lo cual supone un incremento con respecto a los 341.400 millones de wones (304 millones de dólares) de 2019.

Otras empresas líderes de la industria incluidas Lotte Confectionery Co. Crown Confectionery Co. y Haitai Confectionery & Foods Co. también registraron fuertes ventas en el extranjero.

Lotte vio incrementar sus ventas de Choco Pie en el extranjero hasta los 101.000 millones de wones (90 millones de dólares) en 2020 frente a los 93.000 millones de wones (83 millones de dólares) del año anterior. La compañía opera cuatro plantas de Choco Pie en el extranjero -dos en la India una en Rusia y otra en Pakistán-.

Además Lotte exportó el año pasado productos de confitería valuados en aproximadamente 100.000 millones de wones (89 millones de dólares) mientras que las ventas en el extrajero de su producto más vendido desde hace mucho tiempo -Pepero- alcanzaron los 35.000 millones de wones (31 millones de dólares). Pepero es un palito delgado de galleta con una cobertura de chocolate.

Las exportaciones de Crown se incrementaron un 10 por ciento interanual hasta los 22.000 millones de wones (19 millones de dólares) en 2020 y las de Haitai subieron un 20 por ciento hasta los 40.000 millones de wones (35.714 millones de dólares).

Las fuertes ventas en el extranjero de las firmas surcoreanas de confitería se producen en medio del creciente interés suscitado por Corea del Sur y la cultura del K-pop o la ola coreana en el extranjero.

Una fuente de la industria dijo que los dulces de Corea del Sur están ganando más popularidad entre los extranjeros así como entre los ciudadanos surcoreanos en el extranjero gracias al continuo interés en la ola coreana y la comida coreana.

El Gobierno de Santiago de Cuba retomó la venta normada de cigarros Criollos Populares Titanes y Aromas con un nuevo esquema que presentó como un intento de frenar un contrabando que —calculan involucrados— mueve en el mercado negro de la provincia entre 100 y150 millones de pesos en un año. Sin embargo en la práctica lo que parece haber conseguido es que en el negocio ilegal entren más manos.

Según dijeron a principios de abril las autoridades en la edición impresa del periódico Sierra Maestra el propósito de la medida es ""organizar el expendio de productos de gran demanda popular para evitar su acaparamiento y reventa a precios abusivos"".

La Intendencia fijó la distribución per cápita en entre dos y cuatro cajetillas por cliente (mayor de 16 años de edad e inscrito en la ""Libreta de Abastecimiento"") y puso a delegados del Poder Popular presidentes de los consejos populares representantes de las llamadas ""organizaciones de masas"" miembros de la Asociación de Combatientes y la Policía a vigilar el proceso de venta. El primer resultado ha sido un aumento de los implicados en el negocio más lucrativo y difícil de desmontar en Santiago de Cuba.

DIARIO DE CUBA corroboró que en restaurantes cafeterías bares centros nocturnos kioscos unidades móviles y las carpas de venta de alimentos y otros productos instaladas en los lugares más poblados de la ciudad casi se detuvo la venta de cigarros y lo poco que se comercializa es bajo la mirada inquisidora de los ""factores"" designados para la vigilancia por la Intendencia.

Para los habitantes del territorio la decisión de la Intendencia no ha tenido impacto positivo porque no ha conseguido frenar el flujo hacia el mercado informal donde los cigarrillos rubios se cotizan a 100 pesos la cajetilla los negros a 50 los de filtros a 60 los mentolados a ocho cada unidad y las cajas con 20 gruesas (cartones) a entre 6.000 y 10.000 pesos según el nivel de disponibilidad cuando el precio oficial de la cajetilla es de 10 pesos para los cigarros negros (Populares Titanes Criollos) y 12 para los rubios (Aromas).

El pueblo paga las consecuencias

Marilyn del poblado de Siboney aseguró que su delegada ""recogió 50 pesos por casa. Al final le robó una caja a cada núcleo donde había más de una tarjeta no los tuvo en cuenta. En vez de erradicar la venta a sobreprecio se puso en manos de otros sinvergüenzas"".

Abel narró que el presidente del Consejo Popular Los Maceos decidió ofertar ""una cajetilla por consumidor. Donde no había fumadores suspendió la entrega y elevó la edad límite de la distribución hasta los 21 años"" con el supuesto objetivo de ""crear una reserva en las bodegas bajo su mando"".

""Resulta hiriente ver como los dirigentes de base distorsionan las medidas que pueden ayudar en tiempos de desespero. A unos se les ocurren burradas y otros son verdaderos delincuentes que obran a su conveniencia y timan desde las prerrogativas de su cargo"" dijo Clara en el reparto Pastorita.

En Aguilera y Garzón el pueblo comentaba que era hora de frenar las broncas entre los administradores y los dependientes de las cafeterías por la ambición de acaparar los cigarros para ofertarlos a precios exorbitantes.

""Aunque las autoridades conocen que por la izquierda se hacen atrocidades nadie encara el asunto que tiene una expresión idéntica en las tiendas en Moneda Libremente Convertible donde los cigarros no salen ni al mostrador van directo del almacén al delito"" opinó Villa empleado de la recapadora de neumáticos.

Al referirse al trapicheo en las carpas Elvira dijo que ""no están diseñadas para servir al pueblo sino para traficar con todo lo que llega. Allí venden un cajón de cigarros y desvían 20 en la cara del cubano"".

Para Maricela los cigarros son actualmente el producto líder del negocio ilícito en Santiago de Cuba. ""Pero del lobo un pelo. Ahora hago trueques por arroz y azúcar. Yo no fumo y la gente prefiere intercambiar las mercancías porque con la escasez el dinero no resuelve los problemas"" comentó.

El mercado negro se lo traga todo

Según el Anuario el Estadístico de 2018 el Ministerio de Comercio Interior recaudó durante el quinquenio anterior a ese año entre 145 y 76 millones de pesos por concepto de la venta de tabaco fósforos y cigarros en Santiago de Cuba.

El documento indicó que en ese momento se comercializaban anualmente en el territorio entre siete y 12 millones de cajetillas de cigarros.

El Estado recauda todo lo que tiene previsto por la venta de cigarros. La red de venta ilícita no tiene problemas para asegurarlo.

Los actos de fraude se localizan en la manipulación de la oferta el desvió de la mercancía la retención de lotes enteros para crear crisis de desabastecimiento y la participación de quienes tendrían el deber de que la distribución se realizara con transparencia.

A juicio participantes en el ""negocio"" se recauda hasta cinco veces el monto de dinero que el sector debe pagarle al Gobierno.

""Desde que los cigarros salen de la industria tienen dueño aunque las facturas digan otra cosa. Cuando decimos de 150 millones de pesos hablamos de una cifra conservadora y que no incluye a las fábricas ilegales"" dijo el administrador de un establecimiento.

El nivel de insatisfacción de los clientes es tan grande como la falta de interés y la incapacidad de las autoridades para desmantelar el negocio ilícito con los cigarros.

En la actualidad podrían ser miles los vendedores ilegales y el expendio ha pasado casi completamente a manos de los particulares. En los establecimientos estatales solo se hace la venta formal de una cantidad ínfima para encubrir el contrabando del mercado negro.

""Es difícil detectar el fraude porque el Estado no sufre daño. La contabilidad es perfecta"" comentó una económica del distrito Abel Santamaría.

""Pero quieran o no (las autoridades) son aportes de la delincuencia"" añadió. ""Si le robas a los Castro estás preso pero si esquilmas al pueblo te llenas de dinero y progresas. Ese fundamento socialista nos mantiene en la pobreza"" dijo la funcionaria.

En las últimas décadas Santiago de Cuba enfrentó varios escándalos por el robo del dinero de los cigarros. En 2010 fue la más afectada por la circulación de un millón de cajetillas con faltantes a lo largo y ancho de la Isla.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVkaWFyaW8ubXgvbG9jYWwvYXJ0ZXNhbm9zLWRlLWVsLXBhcmlhbi1yZXNpc3Rlbi1jb24tYmFqYXMtdmVudGFz0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGVsZWRpYXJpby5teC9sb2NhbC9hcnRlc2Fub3MtZGUtZWwtcGFyaWFuLXJlc2lzdGVuLWNvbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Artesanos de ""El Parián"" resisten con bajas ventas",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.telediario.mx/local/artesanos-de-el-parian-resisten-con-bajas-ventas on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVkaWFyaW8ubXgvbG9jYWwvYXJ0ZXNhbm9zLWRlLWVsLXBhcmlhbi1yZXNpc3Rlbi1jb24tYmFqYXMtdmVudGFz0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGVsZWRpYXJpby5teC9sb2NhbC9hcnRlc2Fub3MtZGUtZWwtcGFyaWFuLXJlc2lzdGVuLWNvbi1iYWphcy12ZW50YXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Indonesia’s financial hub and most densely-populated city scored particularly bad in terms of air pollution earthquakes and flooding. The report noted that Bandung and Surabaya were also among the world’s top 10 most environmentally vulnerable cities.

“With rising emissions driving weather-related risk and populations growing in many cities across the developing world the risks to citizens real assets and commercial operations are only going to rise” wrote Verisk Maplecroft head of environment and climate change Will Nichols of the report published on Wednesday.

A case in point flooding in Jakarta in 2020 forced more than 34000 residents to leave their homes and according to Indonesian Entrepreneurs Association (Hippi) chair Sarman Simanjorang cost an estimated Rp 1 trillion (US$70.05 million) in economic losses as stores were closed and supply chains disrupted.

Acting Jakarta Environment Agency head Syarifudin said traffic congestion and air and water pollution were common in large cities worldwide. The Jakarta administration has implemented measures to curb these problems but cooperation with neighboring regions remains important he added.

“Controlling water pollution in rivers for example requires the Depok Bekasi Bogor [West Java] and Tangerang [Banten] administrations to curb water pollution in their respective areas because our rivers are connected” he said on Sunday.

Jakarta’s environmental risk is so dire that Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo admitted in 2019 that it was one of the main reasons the government wanted to move the country’s capital to East Kalimantan.

“We need to stop overwhelming Jakarta with overpopulation traffic congestion and water and air pollution. We have to tackle these problems” Jokowi said at a press conference at Merdeka Palace on Aug. 26 2019.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia climate and energy campaigner Tata Mustasya said on Saturday that the government’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions was key to mitigating Jakarta’s environmental and climate risks.

Indonesia as per its commitment to the landmark Paris Agreement has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 29 percent relative to a business-as-usual scenario by 2030 but many researchers are skeptical as to the country’s chances of success mainly due to its growing use of fossil fuels.

In March the Environment and Forestry Ministry announced that the government was planning to set a net-zero emissions target for 2070.

“Indonesia’s commitment toward net zero emissions is so far set for 2070 which would be too late because climate change would devastate people’s livelihoods by then especially those living in vulnerable areas like Jakarta” he told The Jakarta Post via phone call.

Meanwhile Rujak Center for Urban Studies executive director Elisa Sutanudjaja urged the Jakarta administration to tighten regulations related to the city’s transportation industry to curb air pollution.

The city’s policy as embodied by the Jakarta Cleaner Air program assumes that motorized vehicles contribute the largest share to Jakarta’s air pollution at 46 percent. Thus Jakarta has launched several programs to curb transportation pollution such as by expanding public transportation and implementing no-emission zones.

“For regional administrations the easiest and fastest mitigation solution is intervening in the transportation and mobility sector” she said.

Notably environmental groups such as the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) have challenged the city’s assumptions with maps showing that most pollution comes from coal-fired power plants in the neighboring provinces of Banten and West Java.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“Hearst Magazines and Verizon Media may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.”

Henry Cavill posted on Instagram Saturday to ask his online followers to stop speculating about his personal life.

Alongside a photo of him and his girlfriend Natalie Viscuso.

“Dear fans and followers I wanted to make a wee community announcement. I couldn't help but notice that there has been some social animosity of late. It's becoming increasingly prevalent on my feed. There has been lots of let's call it speculation for now about my private life and professional partnerships. Now while I do appreciate the passion and support by those very people who are ‘speculating.’ It has come to such a point that I needed to say something which in itself is a bad thing. We are living in an age of social enlightenment. More and more people are realizing that their views may have been blinkered and that they need to expand them to encompass others. So to you out there who are expressing your disdain and showing your displeasure through a surprising variety of ways it's time to stop. I know it can be fun to speculate to gossip and to dive into our own personal echo chambers on the internet but your ‘passion’ is misplaced and it causes harm to the people I care about most. Even your most conservative of negative assumptions about both my personal and professional life just aren't true. Let's embrace this age of social enlightenment together and move forward with positivity. I am very happy in love and in life. I'd be enormously grateful if you were happy with me. If you can't bring yourself to be happy with me then at the very least try to do yourself proud and be the best version of yourself.”





This post came a little more than a month after Cavill posted the first Instagram official photo of Viscuso.

“This is me looking quietly confident shortly before my beautiful and brilliant love Natalie destroys me at chess” he wrote.

Henry Cavill wrote on Instagram in April alongside a photo of him and Viscuso who was looking at a chess board as if she's in a scene of Netflix's The Queen's Gambit.

Viscuso also posted the photo on her Instagram grid with the caption ""Just teaching my dear Henry how to play some chess...or...maybe he let me win? 🤷🏼♀️""

The couple went Instagram official just days after they were seen walking Cavill's dog Kal in London.

The Justice League star's relationships have long been an interest of the British tabloids but his relationship with Kaley Cuoco might have been the most high-profile of his past.

“Relationship” might not be exactly the right term. Per Cosmopolitan the two only dated for about 10 days in the summer of 2013. Considering the amount of press the two got ""high profile"" still seems to fit the description.

“It was Superman” she told the magazine in 2014.

“I had no one following me until I met Superman. I've been in this business for 20 years and my whole life I could go anywhere do anything. There had not been one paparazzi photo of me until like seven months ago. The recognition has been crazy. And then meeting Ryan and getting engaged so fast I knew people were going to think it was so ridiculous.”

During an interview with Andy Cohen in December 2020 the talk-show host asked Cuoco about her ex-Superman per Us Weekly.

“Kaley is the Man of Steel really made of steel?” he asked reading off a fan question

“Oh my God” she said. “I don't know. I never say 'I don't know.' I always have an answer but I don't know.”

Cavill and Viscuso became Instagram official in the age of COVID-19 when public outings are still rare and unmasked public outings are a no-no. Thankfully it might be a while before she has to answer a question like that in an interview (praying for her that she never does).

Viscuso's not exactly new to the spotlight though. Here's what we know about her.

She was on My Super Sweet 16.

It's been more than 16 years since the first episode of the popular MTV series first aired but if you can think back to season 1 you might recognize Viscuso. Her 16th birthday party was featured on the 2005 season with the following description:

""At 15 years old Natalie is now living in a $5 million house and cruising around town in her dad's Bentleys and Ferraris. What more could she want? How about being the most popular girl at school?""

She's from New Mexico but she spent the latter part of her teen years in California.

The episode description also mentions: ""Natalie has just moved from dull Roswell New Mexico to glamorous La Jolla California to live with her wealthy dad and stepmom.""

She is a Hollywood executive.

Per her LinkedIn Viscuso is vice president of television and digital studios at Legendary Entertainment. Legendary happens to be one of the companies behind Cavill's movies Man of Steel (2013) and Enola Holmes (2020).

Legendary is also behind the October 2021 release Dune starring Zendaya Jason Mamoa Timothée Chalamet Josh Brolin and more.

She is a dog parent too.

Viscuso has a French Bulldog named Meat and she loves to post photos of him (as she should!).

She looks a lot like her mom.

Viscuso has shared many photos of her mom Tammie Kay Baumann who died after a battle with cancer in August of 2017.

""Today I’m choosing to remember her in all of her incredible beauty joy and radiance that she was so loved for"" she wrote a year after her death. ""The last photo here is only a couple months before she died and yet she was still stunning positive minded and shining with love. She never believed she was dying. She had such a hunger for life and desperate need for us to be together mother and daughter...she just wouldn’t accept death. She fought the most excruciating battle...I actually can’t fathom anything worse. But she fought every step with her beautiful smile brightening up the darkest of rooms. She is the strongest woman I’ve ever known. Today that’s what I’m remembering. And of course #fuckcancer.""

And she loves California adventures.

This New Mexico-turned-California girl really seems to love hanging out in the beautiful nature her state has to offer.

Even during quarantine:

And apparently she enjoys chess.

And it has partnered with various sustainability leaders to achieve that aim.

In a tweet shared on May 15 Ripple (XRP) linked to a post on its website. The page detailed a number of aspects of their environmental strategy. This included a list of their partners which already counts the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Mercy Corps Mojaloop Foundation and the Institute for Business and Social Impact among them.

Overall Ripple has non-government organization (NGO) partners in more than 80 countries.

Now sustainability leaders like the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) the Energy Web Foundation and Watershed have joined their ranks. The page also states:

“Our current global financial system does not meet the needs of 1.7 billion unbanked people. “Digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) have the potential to transform how unbanked and underbanked populations access basic financial services and send and receive money across borders making it more accessible affordable and secure.”

The report on the website also referred to how green XRP is compared to leading cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). More specifically XRP uses only 63000 gallons per 100 million transactions. Meanwhile BTC uses nearly 4 billion gallons per 100 million transactions. And ETH uses another 239 million gallons.

Sustainability and crypto

Cryptocurrency’s environmental implications have been the subject of much debate in recent weeks. Not least in light of Elon Musk raising the issue of fossil fuel emissions incurred by bitcoin mining.

The businessman took such a strong stance on this issue that he suspended BTC as a currency option for purchases at Tesla. This decision prompted a swift decline in BTC’s price falling below the $50000 threshold.

Even so Musk’s decision was not met without criticism. Tim Draper for one made the point that the present banking system caused its share of environmental issues. The global investor suggested that by Musk’s philosophy he should stop accepting purchases in fiat currency as well.

Meanwhile other nations are putting other measures in place to protect the environment against BTC mining. On May 15 reports stated that the Iranian authorities would enforce fines to anyone caught mining off household electricity.

Other updates on XRP

It’s an eventful time for Ripple at the moment. As a pending lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues. The next major event in the case is due to take place on May 17 primarily surrounding John E. Deaton’s Motion to Intervene. Deaton is scheduled to reply to Ripple and the SEC’s respective positions on his motion. The SEC will also respond to Ripple’s position on that Motion to Intervene.

But it’s not all bad as on May 16 data indicated that XRP was up over 12% in a 24-hour period. XRP are currently ranked the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jay Duckson's 18-year-old son Berkley was killed in a snowmobile accident in February on Gull Lake.

Berkley Duckson had a love for the outdoors especially for fishing.

""Berkley really really had a zest for life"" said Jay. ""One of those guys that just creates fun creates excitement creates an aura.""

Berkley even helped create a fishing team while at Minnehaha Academy recruiting friends and sponsors to make it happen. But in February while home from college the 18-year-old died in a snowmobile accident. He was Jay's only child and as the fishing opener approaches he misses Berkley more than ever.

""I always look for positives. What good is going to come out of this?"" said Jay.

Shortly after his death Jay was thinking of ways to honor his son. Knowing Berkley's love for the outdoors and for fishing helped him come up with an idea.

""It was a challenge to him to catch a walleye on Gull Lake"" said Jay. ""It just became obvious to friends and family that a foundation that helps people catch more walleye.""

One of the first people Jay called was Dan Eigen. Also known as ""Walleyedan"" he's a Gull Lake fishing guide and a favorite of Berkley's. As fate would have it Eigen happened to meet Berkley just hours before he died.

""I just said 'Hey' and he's like 'Hey.' And he turned around and he said 'God bless you'"" said Eigen.

Eigen himself is going through a battle with cancer. He believes a ""Save the Gull Lake Walleye Foundation"" can help inspire.

""Whatever it may be that betters the fishery or the Gull Lake chain it's got to be a good thing"" said Eigen.

For now the focus will be on increasing walleye habitats while encouraging families to do what Berkley loved to do.

""So when you go fishing with your grandfather or your father or your son you can catch a walleye"" said Jay.

The ""Save the Gull Lake Walleye Foundation"" has already raised thousands of dollars.

A day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines saying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in most places some stores dropped their mask requirements for customers. Walmart Costco Sam’s Club Publix and Trader Joe’s are just some of the big-name stores that have already made the change saying fully vaccinated people can go mask-free except where a mask is required by state or local mandates.

The stores still say unvaccinated people should wear masks. “In accordance with CDC guidelines individuals who are not fully vaccinated are required to use face coverings over their noses and mouths while inside any Publix store” the grocery store chain said in a statement for example. But really the change is just a blanket green light for anyone to shop without a mask because there is no way employees could corroborate the vaccination status of their customers. “We will not require proof of vaccination but we ask for members’ responsible and respectful cooperation with this revised policy” Costco said in a statement updating its mask policy. The stores are also allowing most vaccinated employees to go mask-free.

Even as some rushed to changed their policy other stores are taking a slower approach and have made clear they aren’t ready to change yet. Apple for example said that it will be keeping its mask requirements at its retail stores for now. Kroger the largest supermarket chain in the country also said it wasn’t changing its mask requirements for now as did Home Depot and Target. Walgreens also said it is keeping the mask mandate for now in part because its stores are “a destination for COVID vaccine and testing.”

Some have cautioned against being too eager to drop masks. Unions representing grocery store and retail workers said masks should still be required for now. The new CDC guideline “fails to consider how it will impact essential workers who face frequent exposure to individuals who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear masks” Marc Perrone president of United Food and Commercial Workers’ union said. Writing in the New York Times Zeynep Tufekci says that it isn’t clear why the CDC had such a major change of heart on masks so quickly. “The C.D.C. shift does not seem to fully account for the risks to the great number of unvaccinated people or the immunocompromised especially those working indoors” Dr. Tufekci writes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3dhbG1hcnQtc3RvcmVzLWVtcGxveWVlLW1hc2tzLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart Is Getting Rid of This Starting Tuesday,"On May 13 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) abruptly changed its guidance on masks for the fully vaccinated population suggesting that if you're two weeks out from your final shot you no longer need to wear a face covering outside or inside no matter how crowded the space is. The decision left every company across the country scrambling to figure out whether or not they would be putting the CDC's new mask recommendations into practice and as the world's largest retailer people were particularly curious about what Walmart would do at its stores.

The company ultimately adjusted to the new CDC mask guidance telling customers on the evening of May 14 that effective immediately they no longer need masks to shop in their stores. But it won't be until next week that Walmart will make another major mask change. The company will stop requiring fully vaccinated employees to wear masks at work on Tuesday May 18 too.

Walmart sent out a corporate memo obtained by Best Life to all U.S.-based staffers within 24 hours after the CDC's big announcement. In it Walmart President and CEO John Furner Sam's Club's President and CEO Kath McLay and Walmart's Executive Vice President of Health & Wellness Cheryl Pegus MD said fully vaccinated employees don't need to wear masks indoors or outdoors with some minor exceptions. ""We are also reviewing whether masks may still be required for certain job codes for health and sanitation purposes and will share additional guidance soon"" the memo explains.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

In order for Walmart employees to work without a mask the memo explains they need to fill out a daily health assessment which will only be taken by staffers and answer ""yes"" to the vaccination question. ""If you are not vaccinated we expect you to answer 'no' and to continue to wear a face covering"" the notice states. ""Integrity is one of our core values and we trust that associates will respect that principle when answering.""

The company explains that anyone who has waited the full two weeks after getting the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine or the one-dose Johnson & Johnson jab is considered ""fully vaccinated.""

""Some associates may choose to continue to wear masks and as part of our value of respect for the individual we should all support their right to do so"" the memo states.

Meanwhile anyone who is unvaccinated—store employees or customers—must continue to wear face masks but Walmart will not be requiring proof of vaccination.

Although Walmart has chosen to lift the mask requirements for the vaccinated population not all cities and states are implementing the recent CDC guidance. Some areas that still have mask mandates have not lifted them just yet. State officials in California New York New Jersey North Carolina Massachusetts and Virginia for example are taking the CDC's new guidelines into careful consideration before putting them into effect.

""There may also be local conditions regulatory changes or laws that affect our guidance"" Walmart stated in the memo. ""We will be communicating with your local store club or facility management team as regulations change so they can keep you informed.""

Walmart will be updating signs across all stores that are making the mask change.

The company is also encouraging its employees to get vaccinated and hopes to help the U.S. reach its Fourth of July vaccination goal which President Joe Biden has set as getting at least one dose administered to 70 percent of U.S. adults. As of May 14 59 percent of people in the U.S. over the age of 18 have done so according to the latest CDC data.

In order to inspire staffers to get vaccinated both Walmart and Sam's Club have established a monetary incentive program. According to the memo ""all current U.S. field-based Walmart Sam's Club and Supply Chain associates (hourly and salaried) below the level of store manager"" will receive $75 as a thank you for getting vaccinated. The money which will be included in an upcoming paycheck will also be gifted to associates who received the vaccine prior to the incentive announcement.

More than 5100 Walmart and Sam's Club stores offer the COVID vaccine so staffers can get vaccinated at their workplace if they so choose.

""We can do this. We've been through a lot this year and now we need to do our part to finish this"" the Walmart executives said in their memo. ""We encourage you to get vaccinated and to tell your friends and fellow associates. Thank you to all of you who have already chosen to make a difference and thank you to all of you who will choose to do so now.""

CDFW officials caught the bear around noon Saturday. Tucker said the bear is safe uninjured and appears to be healthy. No one was injured during the incident.

CDFW will release the bear into its proper habitat according to Tucker.

The bear — which appears to be a black bear — was first reported to the Ridgecrest Police Department around 7:30 a.m. Saturday morning Tucker said.

Jon Wheeler was outside working on a chicken coop in his yard around that time when his dog alerted him that something was going on.

""I tucked my head around the corner and (the bear) was there"" Wheeler said. ""I went inside and got my camera and took some pictures.""

The bear then jumped the fence and walked off Wheeler said. He described the bear as a chocolate brown-colored black bear.

Wheeler called the bear sighting in from his home in Kern County. He then learned that the Ridgecrest Police Department had received several calls about the animal.

Wheeler a hunter got within 20 to 30 feet of the bear while photographing it in his yard.

""I respect bears and I was not going to do anything that was going to provoke him or cause a problem"" he said.

The Walmart Supercenter in Ridgecrest was briefly closed once the bear was spotted according to a Walmart employee. The store has since reopened.

The bear was later located on private property asleep in a tree.

Neighbors were alerted to the situation. Ridgecrest Police officers Kern County sheriff's deputies Bureau of Land Management officials and Ridgecrest Police PACT volunteers established a perimeter around the bear while awaiting the arrival of CDFW from Bakersfield.

""It is not uncommon for wildlife to wander into our area always be safe.

On Friday Walmart announced in a letter that ""vaccinated customers and members are welcome to shop without a mask."" Unvaccinated shoppers however are asked to keep wearing masks in stores.

Similarly employees who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be allowed to work without masks as of May 18 the letter added also noting that ""masks will also continue to be required by some city and state ordinances and we will follow those requirements.""

""As we continue to ensure the health and well-being of our partners and customers our restrooms generally remain temporarily closed to the public in stores where the café or café seating is unavailable"" Starbucks added.

The announcements from the various companies comes shortly after the CDC released new federal guidelines surrounding face coverings stating that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can now be indoors or outdoors without masks or social distancing in most cases.

""The science is clear: If you are fully vaccinated you are protected and you can start doing the things that you stopped doing because of the pandemic"" the CDC said in a statement on Thursday about those who are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine or two weeks after the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot.

However the government agency is still leaving the final decision on mask mandates to local and state governments which can continue to require face coverings for fully vaccinated individuals. Private businesses such as many grocery store chains and restaurants can also continue to require masks on their premises.

(Photo: Kent Phillips/Walt Disney World Resort via Getty Images)

Disney World guests can ditch their face masks outdoors the Orlando Fla. theme park announced Friday following new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Starting May 15 face coverings for guests will be optional in outdoor common areas at Walt Disney World Resort with the exception that guests must wear face coverings from the entrances at all attractions theaters or transportation and throughout those experiences"" a Disney spokesperson tells Yahoo Entertainment.

The rules which do not specifically apply to vaccinated guests are also updated on the park's official website. In general face masks are required for guests ages 2 and older except while eating or drinking in a stationary position while physical distancing.

On Friday evening Universal Orlando also announced that face masks are not mandatory while outdoors and SeaWorld stated that ""Face coverings will no longer be required for guests at SeaWorld Orlando Aquatica Orlando and Discovery Cove who are fully vaccinated in accordance with CDC guidance. We will not require proof of vaccine but ask our guests to respectfully comply with our revised policy."" And retailers Trader Joe's Walmart Costco and Starbucks said that vaccinated customers will no longer be required to wear masks.

On Thursday the CDC stated that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (meaning they have received two doses of the shot) can go mask-free indoors and outdoors without practicing social distancing. ""If you are fully vaccinated you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic"" Rochelle Walensky the director of the CDC said in a news briefing. ""We have all longed for this moment when we can get back to some sense of normalcy. Based on the continuing downward trajectory of cases the scientific data on the performance of our vaccines and our understanding of how the virus spreads that moment has come for those who are fully vaccinated.""

People who are immune-compromised should speak to their doctor about a safety plan said Walensky adding that healthcare facilities will continue following their own guidelines. She warned that recommendations might tighten if the pandemic grows although increased vaccination rates should lessen the odds of new variants spreading. ""If you develop symptoms you should put your mask back on and get tested right away"" said Walensky. ""The science is also very clear about unvaccinated people. You remain at risk of mild or severe illness of death or of spreading the disease to other.""

In the United States more than 120 million people (36.2 percent of the population) have received both shots of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Also this week the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices gave Pfizer the stamp of approval to vaccinate children ages 12 to 15 following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency-use authorization to vaccinate kids starting at age 12 lowering the minimum age from 16 as Yahoo Life previously reported.

During the pandemic Disney World closed for 116 days with a phased re-opening in July while Disneyland in Anaheim Calif. stayed closed for more than a year re-opening in April with revamped attractions limited capacity and rules that banned hugging cast members. However masks are in still place.

“Disneyland Resort’s current guidelines which require all guests (ages 2 and older) and cast members to wear face coverings remain in effect until further notice"" a spokesperson from Disney tells Yahoo Entertainment. ""Policies will be evaluated in accordance with state and local recommendations as soon as guidance is released.”

Disney is one of the longest running animation studios in the world. As a result the studio’s nearly 100 year legacy also provides a substantial insight into the history of the animated film.

Disney: The Magic of Animation features 500 items — original sketches drawings paintings concept art and models. They have been carefully curated from the 65 million artworks at the Walt Disney Animation Research Library in Los Angeles.

The first feature exhibition at Australia’s national museum of screen culture since its major redevelopment it showcases Disney’s legacy and the process and artistry at work.

Moving pictures

When you first enter the exhibition space you are greeted with an array of large scale zoetropes — spinning cylinders with flickering images inside. They display the animated characters of Mickey Mouse Pluto and Donald Duck.

These pre-cinematic animation devices provide a neat summation of the animation process in which a quick succession of individual drawings each one slightly different than the previous can create a moving image. The zoetropes remind us animation has existed for many decades (if not centuries) prior to the invention of cinema.

Also on display are artworks from some of the studio’s earliest and most iconic animated shorts such as Mickey Mouse’s Steamboat Willie and Plane Crazy. Equally impressive are the extensive artefacts from more than 25 feature films ranging from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to this year’s Raya and the Last Dragon.

Australia has also played a little known but substantive role in the Disney animation story. Between 1988 and 2006 Walt Disney Animation Australia operated in Sydney and employed hundreds of extremely talented Australian animators artists and technicians.

They worked on dozens of animated sequels to big name Disney features including The Lion King II: Simba’s Pride Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp’s Adventure and Peter Pan: Return to Neverland.

Artistry on display

Exhibition curators have chosen a remarkable selection of highly dynamic animation drawings for display. Even as still images these pencil drawings express incredible life and movement.

There are also a number of concept drawings created by American artist Mary Blair whose designs informed Disney’s Cinderella Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. She was also known for her children’s book illustrations (I Can Fly) and murals (including Disneyland’s It’s a Small World attraction). Her drawings and paintings use just a few strokes and splashes of contrasting colour to convey brilliant vibrancy and expression.

Also remarkable to behold are the series of background paintings from 1959’s Sleeping Beauty. Created by artist Eyvind Earle the works show angular shapes and exquisite detail. Eyvind Earle’s sister Yvonne Perrin was also an animation background painter who spent much of her life in Australia working at the Eric Porter Animation Studio in Sydney and later illustrative children’s books with bush themes.

Mechanical to digital

It’s not just two-dimensional art on display. Model cars made of wood and metal from the production of 101 Dalmatians provide insight into the technical aspects of making the film.

Painted black and white the cars were moved by hand and filmed in real time using high-contrast film-stock. The resulting footage was then enlarged and transferred frame-by-frame onto cels and incorporated into the rest of the animated scene.

The result was fluid motion on screen and accurately depicted vehicles which despite appearing to careen around corners and collide with each other maintained their precise dimensions. The approach to some degree anticipated the use of 3D digital models that would be incorporated into the studio’s later animated films.

Because Disney’s more recent films like Frozen and Moana were created almost entirely in the digital realm the displays devoted to them tend to highlight concept art rather than production materials. But it is still fascinating to see the concept artwork which guided these films through their early development. We gain a greater understanding of how the artists conveyed atmosophere adventure and enchantment to create fantasy worlds.

As technology has evolved so have Disney’s characters and narratives. This is notable as the exhibition reacquaints visitors with classic and dainty Disney princesses through to today’s more contemporary warriors like Moana and Raya.

Disney: The Magic of Animation celebrates each frame and component behind some of audiences’ favourite films of the last century. In doing so the exhibition not only provides an illuminating peek into the animation process — but also gives us the opportunity to admire the artistry and complexity of what went into making every second of these works of art.

View the current offers here.



When you think of a Florida theme park hotel I'd bet you probably don't think of deep rich colors hardwoods and a refined turn-of-the-century New England-style nautical-themed resort.

And when you think of a hotel pool you likely don't conjure up images of a 3-acre waterpark complete with a life-size shipwreck replica that is home to a long twisting turning waterslide.

But all this and actually a lot more is precisely what you'll find at what has to be one of the best hotels at Disney World Disney's Yacht Club Resort. In fact when we picked this resort for a short Florida getaway we actually considered not spending any days in the Disney theme parks to go along with it. We amended that plan for one day at Epcot but it wouldn't be unreasonable to do an entire vacation here without getting on a single ride. In this case the resort could be the destination.

Disney's Yacht Club (1990) opened in the same era of rapid Disney World development as Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort (1988) and both share a type of ocean theme. However the two couldn't be more different from one another. With just over 600 rooms (compared to more than 1500 at Caribbean Beach) this deluxe Disney resort offers guests a vacation within a vacation both in terms of comfort and amenities.

After a recent stay at the property it was all I could do to not add another night when the time to check out unfortunately arrived. And while not everything is postcard-perfect at this Disney resort at the moment I promised myself (and my kids) we'd be back. It's that special.

Let's start with some bad news: Disney's Yacht Club is often expensive.

This is one of Disney's deluxe resorts and there is no Disney Vacation Club wing of this hotel. This means you can't rent DVC points to potentially book a room for less the way you can at places such as Polynesian Village Resort. (Note that you can do this at the neighboring Beach Club Resort.)

If you can snag a room during a sale or with a solid discount you can probably get the rate down to $350-$400 per night but it's unlikely to go much lower. It's common for rooms here to go for $500 and up especially once standard rooms are sold out and you need to pay even more for a water view which is precisely what I had to do. The view itself is (in my mind) not actually worth an upcharge but sometimes that's all that's available.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

While I booked during a 30% off sale my water-view room at the Yacht Club still came to just over $500 per night. There are some ways to use points for Disney World vacations such as using miles from the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card to offset the expense at a 1 cent = 1 mile valuation but there's no way to get outsize value for your credit card points at Disney properties.

If you do decide to book a Disney resort like this one it can make sense to go through a Disney Vacation Planner as that doesn't add to your cost and they do a great job staying on the lookout for sales and discounts and keeping track of all those ever-changing components of a trip to Disney World.

Location

No doubt it sounds a touch insane to spend $500 for a theme park-adjacent hotel room but the location is one reason why Disney's Yacht Club commands that rate (and often sells out).

This hotel is just a 5-10 minute walk from the World Showcase entrance of Epcot. It is also within walking distance of Disney's Hollywood Studios or you can hop on a boat to take you there since that walk is a bit longer.

Being so close to Epcot also means that the Skyliner stop at Epcot is within very easy reach opening up even more Disney locations such as the Riviera Resort Caribbean Beach Resort and more.

Yacht Club is also an incredibly short stroll away from the BoardWalk which is home to even more shops and restaurants.

I'm happy to save money and stay off Disney property on the first night of the trip or for trips when we aren't going for an all-in Disney family vacation. But when we do go all-in on Disney World I want to be in the ""Disney bubble."" Staying at Yacht Club puts you in the heart of the Disney bubble well-cushioned in your own deluxe nautical-themed space but just an arm's reach from lots of great Disney dining and entertainment options.

Check-in

We arrived at Disney's Yacht Club in the early afternoon after starting the vacation off with a character brunch at Topolino's Terrace at the top of the nearby Disney Riviera Resort. (Which I highly recommend you add to your to-do list if you love characters and can snag a reservation.)

Since we arrived a few hours before official check-in time I didn't have high hopes our room would be ready given the era of pandemic precautions but that became the first pleasant surprise of the trip when Room 2077 was ready and waiting for us several hours early.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Check-in is also where we were informed that while room service has returned as an option for breakfast and dinner regular housekeeping had not yet returned to Disney resorts. Towels and trash would be attended to every other day. For our two-night stay that meant there would be no formal housekeeping services though we could ask for more towels and such.

Room

If you are able to manage stairs you can easily access the second level of the resort — where we stayed — via the lobby without using the elevators.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

In fact heading up the lobby stairs reveals some fun touches such as a ship's wheel among other themed decor.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Our room was a bit of a walk down several hallways so if that's an issue ask for a room closer to the lobby if available.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Inside a room at Disney's Yacht Club you aren't going to find bright colors Disney characters or loud decor. If that's what you want I recommend Disney's Art of Animation which has plenty of color and characters.

Yacht Club was renovated in recent years to appeal not only to traditional Disney vacationers but also to conventiongoers who frequently stay at the resort during normal times. And in this case everyone won with a redesign that maintained the overall theme but upgraded the offerings.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

The rooms still carry out the resort's high-end nautical theme but in a way that is elegant and more refined than the previous 1990s-era version.

Like with other Disney resort upgrades the beds are now raised and the floors are now hard instead of carpet. As Disney renovated rooms across its properties this has been the standard it is changing to.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

There's a pullout sofa that can be used as a sleeper and a small writing desk.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Most notably there were outlets everywhere. We travel with a lot of things that need charging and we didn't come close to using them all up. Some furnishings may be made to look like turn-of-the-century New England but they are loaded with modern-day power.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

The two queen beds were perfect for a good night's rest after a busy day at Disney.

In the room you'll also find a minifridge and Keurig.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

We were impressed with the amount of storage the room had in the form of shelves racks cubbies and drawers. We were able to stay far more organized than normal with a family's worth of stuff thanks to the storage options.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

There was a balcony with two chairs that overlooked a well-manicured green lawn and technically some water. Remember this was a pricier water-view room after all.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

I adored the drapes both because they did a great job keeping light out in the morning but also because they were adorable and perfect for the room featuring constellations.

Like at many other similar Disney resorts the bathroom had a vanity with two sinks located in a cubby between the main room and the bathroom so it could be used while someone was in the shower.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

The bathroom area had a sliding door for both the room itself and the tub/shower combo. There were plenty of Disney H2O+ bath products in the shower and bathroom area.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1

We found the room incredibly nice but do know that it doesn't take much to hear what's going on in the hallway or other rooms around you. If you like total silence you'll be well-served to pack some earplugs and a white noise app to go along with your Mickey ears.

Amenities

The Yacht Club room is plenty comfortable but that's probably not why you stay at Disney's Yacht Club — it's certainly not why we paid what we did to stay here.

Stormalong Bay pool complex

What makes this resort so special is the 3-acre pool complex shared with the neighboring Disney Beach Club Resort.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Dubbed Stormalong Bay this pool complex has everything from a 230-foot waterslide to a lazy river whirlpool shallow splash area toddler slide hot tubs and more. It even has a sandy bottom in some of the areas which feels so much nicer on your tired Disney feet than a hard surface.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

This pool area is almost a mini-waterpark and certainly worthy of planning some time in your schedule just to enjoy it. Right now it can get busy to the point where there is no way to get in during peak times.

However we had a blast also going late at night after the parks closed when there were very few people in the pool at all. While the hours can vary it was open from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. during our stay.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

There are four cabanas at the pool you can book if you want extra space and service but you need to reserve well in advance if you want those because they go quickly.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Getting into the pool requires verification you are a resort guest and you're then assigned the colored wristband of the day to wear. There's plenty of towels at the pool as well as a small army of lifeguards keeping a close watch on the various areas of the pool.

Stormalong Bay is adjacent to Hurricane Hanna's Waterside Bar & Grill so it's pretty easy to pop over there and order a snack or cocktail. The $12 seafood roll turned out to be a perfect snack for us.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

My 11-year-old gave the $6 Lava Smoothie (made of raspberry coconut and pineapple flavors) high marks and my $14 Frosé was excellent.

Whether your group is made up of adults some teens tweens or toddlers this pool area is truly excellent especially if you build in some time to enjoy it when most people are sleeping eating or in the Disney parks.

Evening movies on the beach

Several nights per week at 8 p.m. a Disney movie is shown along the ""beach"" at the Yacht Club. This is free to enjoy and the week we were there the films showing were ""Zootopia"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Disneynature: Earth.""

Gym

I'll never fully understand who needs a treadmill at Disney when it's normal to walk 10 miles a day in the park but Yacht Club has those and more in its gym that overlooks Stormalong Bay.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Magical Express Bus

Until the end of 2021 if you want to take the included Magical Express Bus transportation to and from the Orlando airport that's available to those who stay at this and any other full-fledged Disney resort hotel. If you decide to self-park at Yacht Club it's going to cost you $25 per night. The upside is that the fee also gives you access to parking at the Disney theme parks at no additional charge.

The Magical Express Bus stop is right in front of the hotel entrance and the bus stop to go to the various Disney theme parks is just to the side of the hotel entrance.

Still-closed amenities

If you remember when I mentioned there are still some small bumps at Yacht Club here's where they begin.

Those looking for the ultimate once-in-a-lifetime Yacht Club experience may want to hold off a tiny bit longer if you want to experience all the amenities. The Club Lounge remains closed as does one of the main sit-down restaurants.

On top of that the onsite Ship Shape Salon is still closed along with the Lafferty Place Arcade.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

Normally you can rent boats or even sign your kids up for a pirate-themed adventure that leaves from the dock outside of the Yacht Club but all of that is also still on pause.

We had plenty to do for a few days without any of those amenities but just keep in mind that some things remain shuttered for now.

Dining

Ale & Compass Restaurant

Just off the lobby of Yacht Club is a dark subdued restaurant called Ale & Compass. While you do need reservations to eat breakfast or dinner here it's one of the easier reservations to get at Disney World.

Described as ""Yankee comfort food"" this menu has options such as lobster-and-corn chowder; a fantastic salad called the Ale & Compass salad with additions such as pumpkin seeds and beets; steak; pasta; and a burger with bacon and Vermont cheddar served with thick fries.

Getting good photos in the dark restaurant was next to impossible but we enjoyed our salad and burger.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

And while we didn't eat breakfast here I've heard good things about the dark chocolate waffles.

Our service here was quite friendly but incredibly slow. The wait for our reservation was pretty extensive followed by another wait for a server to arrive at our table to start the meal-ordering process. This is likely at least in part due to the restaurant having a brisk business of to-go orders that you can make from the Disney app along with the other sit-down restaurant at the hotel remaining closed.

Ale & Compass Lounge

Another alternative to the restaurant is the adjacent Ale & Compass Lounge which also has a sleek updated but pretty dark look once day turns to night.

In the back of the lounge is a bar with the front portion offering a variety of seating options and a reduced menu that still includes the burger and chowder.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

The Market at Ale & Compass

In the gift shop area of the hotel is the Market at Ale & Compass where you can order grab-and-go options in the Disney app.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

We tried the $12 breakfast bowl that had a little bit of everything on it and was actually almost enough food for myself and two kids for a quick pre-park breakfast.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

The $7 ham and cheese breakfast sandwich on a pretzel roll also looked really solid.

In the afternoon and evening you'll find a variety of sandwiches a hot dog and a panini on the menu.

Beaches and Cream Soda Shop

If you're going to splurge cash on staying at the Yacht Club I highly recommend also splurging some calories at Beaches and Cream. You're going to need to make a reservation here well in advance (dining reservations are accepted 60 days before your trip) or get very lucky.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

We planned our trip pretty close-in and were never able to snag advance reservations but got lucky with timing that they had an outdoor table available for us to order the most exciting item on the menu ... the Kitchen Sink.

This $35 sink of ice cream is made of eight scoops (vanilla chocolate strawberry cookies and cream and mint) along with every single topping in the house. Oh and there's also an entire can of whipped cream on top.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

It's epic huge ridiculous and a lot of fun.

The three of us barely put a dent in it but certainly had fun trying.

There are more regular-sized ice cream options on the menu too but if you're doing a once-in-a-lifetime trip try this once-in-a-lifetime dessert.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Should you want more than just sugar for your meal this is also where you'll find burgers sandwiches chili and other 1950s classic-style treats.

Yachtsman Steakhouse

This second sit-down restaurant has not yet reopened but when it does this is where you can go for those post-convention expensed sales dinners ... or a very nice meal out for two. The menu features a $135 seafood tower prime porterhouse lobster filet mignon elk lobster and other similar entrees that start around $50.

Overall impressions

I'm a total and complete sucker for a well-themed well-located Disney World resort. Resorts such as this one along with Disney's Polynesian Village Resort Disney's Wilderness Lodge Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge and others have me hook line and wallet.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

For me the resort hotel isn't just a place to sleep at night it's also a destination much like the theme parks themselves. I enjoy the scent in the lobby the storyline of the property the Disney touches throughout and the convenience of being fully immersed in Disney magic.

While my kids vetoed the idea I'd have been totally happy having Disney's Yacht Club Resort serve as our actual final destination for the weekend with no park time at all. However since it is such an easy walk to Epcot adding that park on was actually a whole lot of fun too.

If what you want is just a decent bed close to the parks don't stay here. You're probably overpaying to stay at Yacht Club if you don't truly value the Stormalong Bay pool area. You can stay at the next-door Disney Swan and Dolphin for a fraction of the cash if you're just after location.

And right now with some amenities still closed I don't recommend staying here if you are going to be upset when things aren't 100% full service and perfect. The prices are as high as ever to match demand so don't expect a reduced price to match the reduced amenities.

But if you can overlook a few things and what you want is a fun slightly grown-up hotel theme a great location access to the best resort pool at Disney World and easy access to multiple restaurants Disney's Yacht Club Resort is now officially one of my favorite Disney hotels — and one that I can't wait to return to in the coming years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd21hZ2ljLmNvbS9hdHRyYWN0aW9ucy9rYWxpLXJhcGlkcy9uZXdzLzE2bWF5MjAyMS1rYWxpLXJpdmVyLXJhcGlkcy10aGUtYmVnaW4tbGF0ZXItb3BlbmluZ3Mtc3RhcnRpbmctdG9kYXkuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kali River Rapids to begin delayed openings starting today at Disney's Animal Kingdom,"Forum Forums

But a deal appears to be coming both faster than expected and not in the form that many anticipated.

It appears that AT&T is about to do a deal with Discovery that top sources believe will mean the ascent of Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav 60 and a likely changing of the guard at WarnerMedia. Caveat: The words you are about to read involve speculation but not uninformed speculation. With that a few takeaways:

Deal or no deal this gets the ground in Hollywood shaking. Before it emerged that Discovery was in the game the betting had been that NBCUniversal would make off with the WarnerMedia assets including premium cabler HBO Warner Bros. Studios and Turner networks like TNT and TBS. A decision to make an offer would have been up to NBCU owner Comcast which may have hesitated and lost out on the chance. Now sources believe NBCU will turn its sights on ViacomCBS.

Whether or not that happens says one knowledgeable source depends on if ViacomCBS chairman Shari Redstone is a seller (she’d have to consider it given the state of the media world) and if the deal — which would potentially bring assets including CBS and NBC with their various news operations under one roof not to mention Paramount and Universal — can pass federal antitrust scrutiny. It would be sure to face a much harder look from regulators than a Discovery combination with WarnerMedia and there is no doubt assets would have to be shed if such a marriage were attempted. Viacom declined to comment and Discovery and NBCU did not respond to a query.

On to the deal: Top media insiders say one of Discovery’s largest shareholders Liberty Media chairman John Malone 80 will have crafted a structure with what one calls “a brilliant tax dimensionality to it.” (Malone who has been making deals in the telecom and media industries for decades is known to seek out esoteric and occasionally underutilized pieces of tax law to minimize his and his company’s tax exposure. For example Malone gushed in a CNBC interview about the “brilliant” tax structure for Liberty’s acquisition of Formula 1 a deal that included a tracking stock and shell companies spread across multiple continents.) These top insiders cannot see a world where the deal doesn’t put Malone in control meaning Zaslav runs the combined entity. They do not see this as a promising development for 50-year-old WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar.

Malone has not hidden his questions about the AT&T/WarnerMedia streaming adventure. In 2018 he said this to CNBC’s David Faber: “I don’t know if AT&T is willing to write those massive checks to play against the incumbents Amazon Netflix and to compete with Disney on the margin for that third seat. If I was [then AT&T chairman Randall Stephenson] I would be scratching my head and saying ‘When I bought HBO it was the crown jewel it was what I wanted; now it is subscale. The question now is how much do I have to spend and how much income do I have to forgo for the next couple of years to build up?’” It appears that current AT&T boss John Stankey came to scratch his head about that too.

Malone is known to be a media-world genius but was it really that hard to anticipate that AT&T might have difficulty figuring out how to run a legacy media operation especially when it is fighting battles on other fronts? AT&T is a telecommunications company and now appears to be one in the long list of outsiders to find that entertainment is hard especially in pandemic-accelerated transformational times.

Saddled with debt the company was warned by more than one of its own in-house entertainment-industry veterans (who found themselves kicked to the curb) that the spend required to launch a streaming service would be massive — far more than the parent would be willing or able to spend. (Asked about the possible spending crunch in a May 14 interview in The Wall Street Journal Kilar responded: “Sounds juicy.”)

This appears to be the second big bobble for AT&T which acquired DirecTV for $67 billion inclusive of debt in 2015 and this year agreed to spin it off (alongside AT&T’s own UVerse business) in a deal valued at only $16.25 billion. That’s a $50 billion haircut. It isn’t yet clear how the former Time Warner assets will be valued in a new deal with Discovery.

A source with knowledge says that two years ago Zaslav proposed combining Discovery and HBO Max in a joint venture but that Stankey nixed the proposal. Times have changed. Discovery’s streaming rollout for Discovery+ has been somewhat slow going with the company disclosing in April that all of its streaming services combined have 15 million subscribers. Nonetheless Zaslav told investors the rollout was “exceeding our expectations and demonstrating sustained momentum into the second quarter.”

Should all go forward it is far from clear how the new company will be configured. One person rumored to be hungering for a bigger job at WarnerMedia is CNN president Jeff Zucker 56 who is known to have locked horns with Kilar and who said in February that he will leave at the end of the year. Now the question is will he?

It may be petty gossip to note that Zaslav is very good friends golf buddies and Hamptons neighbors with Zucker. But industry insiders have noted this gossip. They also believe Zucker may have let Stankey know he was leaving if Kilar was staying. The CNN chief remains on very friendly terms with Stankey and was invited on the AT&T chief’s Augusta golf outing over the holidays even after announcing his plan to leave.

One associate thinks this deal may mean Zucker will stick around. “My intuition is he doesn’t want Jason Kilar’s job believe it or not” this person says. With oversight of CNN and Turner Sports which just closed deals with the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball Zucker may see running those businesses as “fun” this person says while “the HBO Max thing is really complicated really messy.”

If a major changing of the guard is indeed coming at WarnerMedia there will be schadenfreude. In the aftermath of AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner new management has purged the old guard including veterans with a sense of how to run legacy media businesses. Some of those people as well as others in Hollywood have bristled at the certitude of Stankey’s chosen WarnerMedia boss Kilar. Whatever big checks WarnerMedia has written to smooth over its decision to blindside Hollywood with its day-and-date streaming strategy in December for example the sting of it lingers. So does the purge of those who had spent careers building WarnerMedia assets.

“It wasn’t perfect but it really was a cool place” recalls one former insider who says AT&T management “did not have to destroy the DNA” that made these places special before adding “The shame of it. The arrogance.”

He’s poised to record quite a knockout if he pulls off a merger with AT&T’s WarnerMedia unit in a pact that will leave him as the ultimate keeper of the keys to HBO HBO Max Warner Bros. Turner channels and a growing global suite of direct-to-consumer streaming businesses.

News of Discovery’s pursuit of a union with the erstwhile Time Warner assets came on so fast that executives and recent alumni of HBO Warner Bros. et al were dizzy with surprise as word spread Sunday morning. The notion that yet another new boss was about to enter the picture was stunning to many after nearly three years of turmoil since AT&T acquired TW in 2018. Zaslav’s roots in the cable business run deep but he is by no means a Hollywood studio guy which makes him a scary commodity to some.

To many Zaslav is best known as one of the most highly compensated CEOs in modern history. Headlines of his nine-figure pay packages in 2014 ($156 million) and 2018 ($129 million) sparked outrage among consumer advocates governance and executive compensation watchdog groups. In fairness those comp numbers were inflated by stock options ($116 million of 2018’s package) that remain at risk depending on the company’s performance over the long haul. But Zaslav nevertheless is part of a stable of veteran cable and media executives in John Malone’s orbit who are handsomely compensated in success.

Popular on Variety

Zaslav has transformed (more than once) Discovery’s business and taken its market cap from $5 billion when he joined at the start of 2007 to $16.3 billion as of Friday. He’s invested in global expansion including pushing into deep into the European sports market with the Euro Sport SVOD platform that spurred Discovery to make big-money bids for Olympic rights and PGA golf in the region.

As an individual Liberty Media mogul Malone is a large shareholder in Discovery with control of about 30% of voting shares. No transaction gets done without his blessing and Malone has been Zaslav’s biggest champion.

Zaslav came up the ranks at NBC during the go-go late 1980s and early 1990s when the pay-TV universe began to expand at a fast clip. He’s got a tough-talking demeanor — enhanced by a distinctive Brooklyn-meets-Boston accent — but he’s also affable and down to earth. His sartorial signature is a sweater vest often emblazoned with a Discovery-related logo.

Sit with Zaslav for five minutes and there is no escaping his infectious enthusiasm for the content business and Discovery’s unique place in it. Zaslav is part of a generation of executives who are justifiably proud of having helped to shape the contours of the multi-channel universe during his early years as a communications lawyer and then a cable distribution executive at NBC. He helped launch CNBC America’s Talking and MSNBC. After years in high-growth sectors – and after collecting some famously fat paychecks – Zaslav exudes endless ambition and a love of the game. He’s the kind of CEO who usually stops to talk to the media gaggle at Sun Valley during the Allen & Co. conference.

During his 15 years and counting at Discovery Zaslav has earned a reputation for a quick trigger finger with management changes and strategies for the company’s bouquet of lifestyle and unscripted channels. Discovery at present has 19 domestic linear outlets and regional channels serving more than 200 territories around the world.

Rich Ross Peter Liguori Margaret Loesch and Marjorie Kaplan are among the executives who have moved through the Discovery universe in recent years. Discovery has made over underperforming channels (Planet Green Velocity Discovery Health Military Channel among others) with content joint ventures and top-to-bottom rebrands. Some have worked out well like Oprah Winfrey’s OWN (after a few years of patience) and some have not like the long-gone Discovery Times documentary project with the New York Times or the kid-focused Hub partnership with Hasbro.

Sources who have worked with Zaslav say he can be “unemotional” and “clinical” about making the business case for change even when a pink slip comes out of nowhere for top executives. Discovery has also incurred the wrath of independent producers by squeezing them on production costs and demanding cost-cutting moves at the expense of program quality. By all accounts Zaslav and his business lieutenants run a tight ship.

In 2018 Discovery made a bet on getting bigger by scooping up Scripps Networks’ lifestyle channels anchored by Food Network and HGTV for nearly $14.6 billion. Zaslav’s challenge now is to make Discovery’s channel menu into a player in the direct-to-consumer streaming arena even though Discovery Plus which bowed Jan. 4 does not have the scripted serialized programming that lends itself to binge watching in an on-demand format. Discovery has to convince viewers to watch HGTV’s design shows TLC’s dating dramas and Food Network’s competition series in a whole new way.

Discovery entered 2021 with a small head start in streaming through its existing services in Europe. Bringing Discovery’s lean-back lifestyle channels together in a cable bundle-like package with HBO HBO Max Warner Bros. movies and such could be an attractive offering for consumers. For global streamers the name of the game seems to be serving up as much fresh content as possible to keep subscribers engaged.

If anybody knows how to experiment with the packaging and marketing of content it’s Zaslav. It’s said that he has made a strong connection with AT&T CEO John Stankey which has greased the wheels for a transaction that no one saw coming just a day ago.

If the deal comes to fruition HBO Warner Bros. and Turner insiders will have to brace for the get-it-done atmosphere of working with Zaslav on a new rehabilitation project. One source who knows Zaslav well called it the “Hurricane David” effect.

“Media right now is a street fight” Zaslav told Variety in 2018. “I’m a fighter. I love it and I love the business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIxLTA1LTE2L2F0LXQtc3BlbnQtODUtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi10aW1lLXdhcm5lci1pdC13YW50cy10aGUtbW9uZXktYmFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T Spent $85 Billion on Time Warner.

AT&T intends to break off its media arm and merge the assets with Discovery in what could be a bid to strengthen the organization against streaming rivals such as Netflix Disney and Apple.

AT&T is believed to be preparing to make a deal with Discovery that could create a new media behemoth one that could be announced within the next week. If agreed the deal would see AT&T spin off its media assets from the rest of the company and then those assets would be combined with Discovery into a new entity.

According to sources of Bloomberg the two organizations are still negotiating the structure of the transaction and it could still collapse at this late stage.

The deal would create an organization that combines the properties owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia unit and Discovery. WarnerMedia includes CNN HBO Cartoon Network TBS TNT and the Warner Bros. studio while Discovery controls networks including HGTV Food Network TLC and Animal Planet.

If true the deal would see AT&T cast off its media assets which it acquired in an $85 billion acquisition in 2018. At the time the deal made one of the largest media conglomerates in the world something the new arrangement will also produce.

The move could give the two organizations a major leg up in the streaming stakes. While WarnerMedia contols HBO Max Discovery also has its own streaming service called Discovery+.

A merger could potentially lead to the two services joining together into a single platform down the road or at least some synergies between them.

Currently the streaming landscape is dominated by Netflix Amazon and Disney but it also includes Apple with its Apple TV+ service. Though the introduction of HBO Max may be a worry for some streaming services a join-up with Discovery will form a serious competitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvYXR0LWRpc2NvdmVyeS13YXJuZXJtZWRpYS1tZXJnZXItbWVkaWEtYXNzZXRzLWhiby1tYXgtc3RyZWFtaW5nLTEyMzQ3NTc4MzYv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS9hdHQtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXdhcm5lcm1lZGlhLW1lcmdlci1tZWRpYS1hc3NldHMtaGJvLW1heC1zdHJlYW1pbmctMTIzNDc1NzgzNi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T Exploring Combination Of Media Assets With Discovery,"AT&T and Discovery are pursuing a merger of their entertainment assets that would reshape the media business particularly the fast-growing realm of streaming.

A person familiar with the situation confirmed to Deadline that talks have been ongoing. The configuration is said to be a joint venture with details still being finalized. WarnerMedia had already been talking with NBCUniversal about a similar arrangement in recent months though those discussions have not borne fruit.

Bloomberg citing unidentified sources had the first report on the combination indicating that a deal could be announced as soon as this week. The Financial Times also said word on a transaction is likely this week adding that AT&T’s board is meeting today to vote on the deal.

Reps from Discovery and AT&T declined to comment when contacted by Deadline.

Plenty of uncertainty remains as to how the assets would be combined and the person familiar with the discussions said they were not guaranteed to lead to a deal. Discovery brings a raft of well-established networks like HGTV Food Network TLC and Discovery. AT&T through its WarnerMedia division has HBO Warner Bros and Turner networks CNN TNT TBS and several others. On the traditional cable side the concentration of so many similar assets would almost certainly face regulatory scrutiny.

The executive suite of the combined entity would be crowded and that structure is said to be another area of flux. Discovery is led by the hard-charging David Zaslav a onetime top sales exec at NBC who has steered Discovery to global growth. Jason Kilar the founding CEO of Hulu and a former Amazon exec arrived as WarnerMedia a year ago. He has made a number of aggressive moves and dramatically restructured the company to help position it to face the digital future.

Both companies have recently joined the streaming fray in significant ways. WarnerMedia launched HBO Max in May 2020. Discovery rolled out Discovery+ in January in the U.S. and soon started expanding it globally. Next month HBO Max will go global and also introduce a cheaper ad-supported tier. Advertising is a key element to Discovery’s offering though it also has an ad-free option.

The new entity would have based on pro forma numbers from 2020 total revenue of $40 billion. Its $12 billion in advertising revenue and $12 billion in spending on programming would rank it in the top echelon in both categories.

Bundling which has already begun at companies like Disney and is widely seen as inevitable in the cutthroat streaming sector could well be an option in a combined entity. Discovery+ focuses entirely on unscripted programming. HBO Max has played in that realm to some degree but scripted fare remains its bread and butter.

After major stumbles in the months after it launched HBO Max has gained traction of late adding 2.7 million subscribers in the first quarter to reach 44.2 million in combination with linear HBO. Executives have credited Warner Bros films premiering on HBO Max at the same time they reach theaters as well as buzzy HBO shows like The Undoing and Max Originals like The Flight Attendant.

The Warner Bros film operation under Toby Emmerich has made steady progress during a time of industry upheaval and the headlong rush into streaming. Films on the studio’s slate including Godzilla vs. Kong and Mortal Kombat have managed to pull in sizable box office while also enticing HBO Max subscribers. GvK has taken in almost $100 million in the U.S. and more than $400 million worldwide despite theaters in many regions still being shuttered along with 40% of North America.

The report is hitting as both companies prepare to deliver high-stakes pitches to advertisers during the annual week of upfront presentations. This year’s upfronts will be virtual due to Covid-19 safety considerations. Discovery’s presentation is on Tuesday and WarnerMedia’s is Wednesday.

A deal would be a major surprise for AT&T which has made a number of moves in the past three years to chip away at the sizable debt it piled up from the acquisition of Time Warner. That $81 billion deal which closed in 2018 after a federal antitrust trial was followed by the shedding of a number of assets. Net debt for AT&T stood at $169 billion as of the end of the first quarter in March despite divestitures ranging from a 10% stake in Hulu to the new corporate headquarters building in Manhattan to anime brand Crunchyroll. The company estimates debt will decline to $154 billion by the end of 2021.

AT&T in February took a big step toward moving the lagging satellite pay-TV operator DirecTV off its balance sheet selling 30% of it to private equity firm TPG. The spinout valued the enterprise at $16.25 billion a steep discount from the $49 billion AT&T paid to acquire DirecTV in 2015. Just prior to the TPG transaction the company announced a $15.5 billion writedown on the DirecTV assets.

Given that AT&T makes more than 80% of its total revenue in the thriving area of wireless and broadband with significant investments in 5G technology designed to keep things humming entertainment has long been an uncertain fit. The Time Warner and DirecTV deals were engineered by Randall Stephenson who departed AT&T as CEO last year. Successor John Stankey is an AT&T lifer who has repeatedly articulated the virtue of marrying wireless assets with film and TV but the execution of that has not bowled over investors. AT&T stock has been locked in a narrow range around $30 a share for the past two years as media rivals especially Disney have seen their stocks prosper due to Wall Street enthusiasm about their progress in streaming.

Discovery absorbed Scripps Networks Interactive in a $14.6 billion transaction that closed in 2018. After the combined company managed through a period when all cable programmers saw viewership and advertising decline it shifted to direct-to-consumer streaming this year. Last month the company said it had reached 13 million subscribers but the expense of rolling it out took a toll on first-quarter income."

What You Need To Know Brown County Port & Resource Recovery is urging people to keep vaping devices out of trash and recycling streams

The batteries can be a fire hazard if they are damaged

In the past 30 to 40 percent of devices had hardwired batteries that number is likely closer to 70 percent now

A drop off site for vaping devices and e-cigarettes is available in Ashwaubenon​

Trucks pull up on a regular basis and drop off more materials. There’s a chance some of those loads include discarded vaping devices and E-cigarettes.

The tiny but powerful batteries in those items can be a potential fire hazard if they are damaged.

“To find something as small as a vaping device in one truck load of material is next to impossible” said Chris Blan a resource recovery technician with the department.

That’s why he and the department are urging consumers to use a drop off site of the used devices to stop them from entering the recycling or waste streams.

“There’s still energy enough left in the battery where if it’s damaged it could become an ignition source for a fire” Blan said.

Marissa Michalkiewicz of Outagamie County Recycling and Solid Waste knows the danger first hand. that department recently had a compactor fire attributed to a lithium ion battery.

“Once you get these things broken apart and they start reacting with one another they can cause serious damage not just for our people who work here but for our equipment” she said.

Initially batteries could be separated from the devices for disposal. But now many are stronger smaller and integrated directly into the device creating a potential fire hazard.

Blan said about half the time when there’s a fire in a waste management facility or transfer truck the cause is likely from a lithium ion battery like those found in vaping products and e-cigarettes.

“To me throwing a vape in your trash or recycling is almost equivalent to throwing a book of matches in your trash” Blan said. “It’s the same kind of risk.”

Brown County offers drop off at the Hazardous Material Recovery facility at 2561 S. Broadway from noon to 6 p.m. on Thursdays and 8 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. There’s a fee of 30 cents per item.

RANSOM PAID: Reports said that Colonial Pipeline Co paid almost US$5m in cryptocurrency to hackers to help get fuel flowing again along the eastern seaboard

Bloomberg





The largest fuel pipeline in the US restarted its entire system after a cyberattack nearly a week ago but said it would take several days for the supply chain to return to normal.

Colonial Pipeline Co has started delivering products such as gasoline diesel and jet fuel to all of the markets it serves the pipeline operator said in a statement on Thursday but some areas might experience service interruptions during the restart process.

The system which transports products from Gulf Coast refineries as far north as New York is running at less than half of capacity people familiar with the matter said.

Earlier it emerged that the operating company last week paid almost US$5 million in untraceable cryptocurrency to eastern European hackers to help get gasoline and jet fuel flowing again along the eastern seaboard.

Fuel shortages from Florida to Virginia continue and Colonial said that its system is about five-and-a-half days behind its current schedule.

In a message to filling stations US President Joe Biden said in a White House briefing on Thursday: “Do not — I repeat do not — try to take advantage of consumers during this time.”

The attack on Colonial occurred just weeks before the US Memorial Day Holiday and the start of the summer driving season with many Americans expected to eagerly take to the roads and the skies.

Earlier in the week average US pump prices surged above US$3 a gallon for the first time in six years as motorists raced to fill tanks.

US gasoline futures were US$2.0938 per gallon early yesterday after dropping 3 percent on Thursday.

More than half of stations in Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina were still without fuel on Thursday according to retail-tracker GasBuddy.

In Miami an area not even directly fed by the pipeline nearly 40 percent of stations were without gasoline.

Hospitals railroads and ambulance services that rely on fuel for generators are the main priority as supply trickles in said Cheryl Waters president of Atlanta Fuel Company which services customers in states including Georgia North Carolina and east Alabama.

She said that it would probably take 10 to 14 days for her company’s operations to return to normal.

“We’re just being very careful with who we sell our fuel to” Waters said. “We’re saving it back for our essential businesses.”

While Colonial works to resume normal operations it said that some line segments were operated manually and might be ahead of the estimated delay.

Amid the constraints fuel traders were even paying each other extra to gain access to the pipeline the first time that has happened since before the COVID-19 pandemic.

New York Attorney General Letitia James issued an alert to New Yorkers concerning potential gasoline price gouging and urged people to report dramatic price increases.

“Don’t panic” Biden said on Thursday. “I know seeing lines at the pumps or gas stations with no gas can be extremely stressful but this is a temporary situation. Do not get more gas than you need the next few days.”

Biden also said that the pipeline should be reaching full capacity soon.

Meanwhile a top US energy regulator said that gaps in pipeline cybersecurity must be filled following the Colonial attack.

“We need to improve our cybersecurity standards and requirements to keep up with these evolving threats especially as they relate to our critical infrastructure” Neil Chatterjee a commissioner and former chairman at the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday.",,,,,,,,,

Sign up for the free Billy Penn newsletter to get everything you need to know about Philadelphia every day.

For the first time in 20 years the Philadelphia 76ers have locked up the No. 1 seed heading into the postseason. This is more than just a cool number — it means they have home-court advantage no matter who they meet on the path to the NBA Finals.

Virtually every professional sports team plays better at home. This is not a new phenomenon. Players wake up in their own beds. At the game they’re met by cheers not jeers.

But the Sixers do it better than most.

Before the NBA shut down for COVID last year Philly was 29-2 at home. This year they won 80% of games played on their own turf.

“Going back to last season we are amazing at home” star center and MVP candidate Joel Embiid said in April. “When you play in Philly they’re gonna push you they’re gonna get on you they’re gonna boo you. You got to come out and give on 110%.”

What is it about the Wells Fargo Center — and the fans that fill it — that gives Philadelphia the best home-court advantage in the league? Here’s five prime reasons.

A neighborhood drumline leads the cheers

One of the first things fans finding their seats and players warming up on the court will hear at the South Philly arena is the team drumline who call themselves the “Stixers.”

The Stixers are unique compared to other drumming troupes in the league.

Instead of being just an accompaniment to team dancers and the mascot the Stixers are deeply integrated with neighborhood culture with performers part of a Philadelphia community organization called the West Powelton Drummers.

The group was founded 30 years ago by the West Powelton Concerned Community Council when founder Elsie Wise “strapped a couple drums onto girls from the neighborhood” and eventually was responsible for drawing many young men in Philadelphia off the streets with peak membership reaching triple digits.

After Wise died last year one member said she and the drumline singlehandedly “…kept [him] out of the graveyard and kept [him] out the jail cell.”

The West Powelton Drumline has won multiple national state and world championship competitions and have been the official 76ers official drumline for home games since 2014.

Opposing teams start with boos

Before the ball even tips off fans get an early opportunity to express themselves during team intros acting as a Greek chorus condemning the opposing team before they take a single shot.

The script is easy to follow but effective:

P.A. announcer Matt Cord: [lackadaisically reads off opposing player’s height weight college and name] Sixers fans: “SUCKS!!!” (Repeat for every player in the lineup and yes make sure to tell the coach he sucks too.)

Sixers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey earlier this week said this tradition was what he was most excited for with fans back in attendance.

What I am mostly excited for with the announcement that we will have 10k fans in the playoffs is that during opposing team lineup introductions the players will now for sure hear how much they truly suck.



This is my current favorite @sixers crowd tradition – when did it start? https://t.co/hvnNlU1jDP — Daryl MorΞy 🗽🏀 (@dmorey) May 11 2021

Welcoming back most fans in Eastern Conference

Speaking of fans in the stands relaxation of COVID mitigation rules is coming at an opportune time for the championship-seeking Sixers.

During the first round the Wells Fargo Center will allow 50% capacity at the 19500-seat Wells Fargo Center. The Milwaukee Bucks will also seat 50% of their fans but because of the size of their arena it’ll be about a thousand fewer people.

No other team is yet slated to back more than 45% of their fans though some are expected to make changes before the postseason begins.

Sixers President Chris Heck said the team was “thrilled by the city’s decision” to allow more fans in attendance noting the obvious:

“Our fans have created the most passionate and intense atmosphere in the NBA and that gives us the type of home-court advantage our players can feed off in the postseason.”

Free throw misses = tasty treats

Then there’s the free throw prizes. During the second half of Sixers games shots from the charity stripe take on an increased significance.

If an opposing player misses two in a row at Wells Fargo Center during the 3rd or 4th quarter everybody who goes to a Wendy’s in the “Philadelphia Tri State Area” the next day gets a free Frosty dessert shake.

This seemingly cheesy promotion has become intrinsic to Process lore. It went viral in 2019 when a fan in the stands flipped him double middle fingers during then-Wizards point guard Isaiah Thomas’ free throws and told him “f*ck you” three times.

Thomas later confronted the fan about his perceived disrespect. The man responded “Sorry I just wanted a Frosty.”

Over the years various Sixers have taken up the mantle of “Freeze Out Guy” hyping fans to get loud enough to cause the opponent to miss free throws.

The role once belonged to former Sixer Robert Covington who during his first game back to Philly after a trade was asked if he’d miss two free throws on purpose to get the fans their Frosty.

“If we were up big and I was about to go out and it came down to it would I do it?” Covington said in 2019. “Probably. Ok probably.”

This season the job has fallen on the extremely large shoulders of Dwight Howard whose infectious enthusiasm and ability to connect with fans made him the promotion’s perfect successor.

? 10-9-8-76ers ?

Lastly there’s the song. Whenever the Sixers get a home win fans in the arena are treated to possibly the greatest bad tune ever written.

“Here Come the 76ers!” is a disco-inspired track written for the team in 1975 the tempo set by the dribble of a basketball heavily centered around multiple octaves of a piano plunking an E natural over and over and over.

The song is both braggadocious and twee declaring the Sixers the “team of the year” telling fans to “clap their hands/stomp their feet” for the team and then leading the crowd in a countdown (10 9 8 76ers… 1 2 3 4 5… 6ers.) The entire thing shimmers with milquetoast 70s production that would make Phil Spector rip his hair out.

Nevertheless the song has become a classic for Sixers fans who routinely sing along at games after wins and completely lean into the song’s corniness.

After his first game in Philly in 2018 former Sixer Jimmy Butler praised the catchiness of the song. “Y’all have one of the catchiest things in the whole ‘1-2-3-4-5 Sixers’ deal” he said. “When I was the away team I was always singing it so it’s still stuck in my head.”

The song was even played at the wedding of Process legend and former Sixers point guard T.J. McConnell whose family surprised him with it. “I actually play it all the time” McConnell said. “My friends will be like ‘Let me hear the song!’ And I’ll put it on.”

The song had a mini viral moment at the start of this year’s season when local teen Sadie Smith began posting videos of herself playing along to the tune after each win earning the team’s appreciation and the moniker “Piano Girl.” The song has also been covered by punk bands and even Opera Philadelphia.

The Sixers themselves have even co-opted the song’s chorus for this year’s Twitter hashtag: #HereTheyCome.

Here they come indeed right into the top seed of the playoffs with thousands of energized fans eagerly awaiting their chance to cheer the team on boo whoever is unlucky enough to draw the Sixers as opponents and sing along in victory as the team looks to win Philly’s first NBA championship since 1983.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA1L3VuaXRlZC1iYW5rc2hhcmVzLWVsZWN0cy1jYXBpdG8tdG8tYm9hcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Bankshares elects Capito to board | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/business/2021/05/united-bankshares-elects-capito-to-board/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA1L3VuaXRlZC1iYW5rc2hhcmVzLWVsZWN0cy1jYXBpdG8tdG8tYm9hcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzE1L2Zhbi1lbmVyZ3ktbWFrZXMtcm9yeS1tY2lscm95LXRocmVhdC10by13aW4tcGdhLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fan energy makes Rory McIlroy threat to win PGA Championship,"The sounds were beautifully jarring to Rory McIlroy’s ears.

“Rory! Rory! Rory!”

Those were the roars reverberating two weeks ago from what looked like the largest golf crowd we’ve seen since COVID-19 silenced sports fans some 15 months ago. They were crammed around the 18th green at Quail Hollow at the end of the Wells Fargo Championship which McIlroy was about to win for the third time in his career.

McIlroy who just turned 32 was the most vocal among the players about how the lack of those roars had left his game flat dulled his intensity.

So it was perhaps no coincidence McIlroy an 18-time winner on the PGA Tour with four major championship victories had gone some 550 days without a win before Wells Fargo.

“I thought I’d like the peace and quiet when we returned but I missed the crowds” McIlroy said after that victory at Quail Hollow. “I feed off the energy so much. I’m excited going forward now that we get to play in front of crowds like that. It was just an awesome experience to feel that again over the weekend.”

McIlroy’s career had been stalled before; he has gone months without sniffing a victory.

He too has had a history of rebounding from those slumps. And when he does watch out.

The question — as this week’s PGA Championship at Kiawah Island approaches just two weeks removed from that slump-busting win at the Wells Fargo — is whether McIlroy is about to take off on one of those dizzying runs he has been prone to make in his streaky career.

Because there are few better front-runners in golf than McIlroy. When he gets hot he’s difficult to stop.

Take the last PGA Championship played at Kiawah Island in 2012 as an example.

McIlroy was anything but a favorite to win that PGA. In the three months leading up to it he missed the cut in four of the eight tournaments he played worldwide and didn’t contend in the other four. His best finish in a major that year was a tie for 40th at the Masters.

Yet after he arrived at Kiawah McIlroy won the PGA Championship by a record eight shots and went on to win three more times that year.

Oh yes that also was the week McIlroy met Erica Stoll who then worked at the PGA of America and is now his wife and the mother of their first child.

A good week indeed that PGA at Kiawah followed by a great finish to the year and an even better future.

Before Wells Fargo with Erika and their 8-month-old daughter Poppy in attendance at the 18th hole to witness his win McIlroy hadn’t made the cut in his previous three tournaments including the Masters and Players Championship.

Since the PGA Tour’s COVID-19 restart last June after a 13-week pause McIlroy had just six top-10s in 21 starts results that dropped him to 15th in the world rankings his lowest rank since 2009.

McIlroy’s 18-month winless drought before Wells Fargo was the second-longest dry spell of his career. His win catapulted him to the betting favorite to win the PGA.

The bookies and the bettors are well aware of McIlroy’s ability to go on a mad run once he breaks a slump.

“Once you see progress and you get that little spark of confidence then things can start to move pretty quickly’’ McIlroy said.

“He’s very confident right now so [he’s] going to be very dangerous next week’’ Jason Day said from the Byron Nelson Invitational.

“For him to win at Kiawah wouldn’t be a big surprise to me at all because when he gets rolling he seems to do that for two three months in a row’’ ESPN analyst Andy North said this week.

“It was a couple years ago when you thought he was going to win every week’’ ESPN analyst Curtis Strange said this week. “He’s the guy that can really get on a roll because he’s such a feel player. This could be the start of one of those [runs]. He won last week. His game is in really really fine shape.’’

North said he could not emphasize enough the positive effect that crowds returning to the tournaments have had on McIlroy.

“Rory is one of the guys that COVID really hurt because he is such an electrifying type of player’’ North said. “He runs so much on energy. He is a really good front-runner. I think not having people there really hurt him. He loves to show off. All these guys love to show off but I think [no spectators] hit Rory and Tiger [Woods] probably as much as anybody.

“Getting people back I think is a really big part of that for him and I truly believe that he’ll continue to play well.’’

Consider that fair warning for the other 155 players in the field at Kiawah this week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMtYW1hem9uLWhpcmUtdG8tZmlyZS1qYW1lcy1jaGFybGVzLWxhd3N1aXQtd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tZXhvZHVzLTIwMjEtNdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMtYW1hem9uLWhpcmUtdG8tZmlyZS1qYW1lcy1jaGFybGVzLWxhd3N1aXQtd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tZXhvZHVzLTIwMjEtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top business stories this week: Amazon managers hire to fire,"Hello!

What's trending this morning:

Amazon has a goal to get rid of a certain percentage of employees every year – and three managers told Insider they felt so much pressure to meet the goal that they hired people just to fire them:

""We might hire people that we know we're going to fire just to protect the rest of the team"" one manager said.

The practice is informally called ""hire to fire"" in which managers hire people internally or externally they intend to fire within a year just to help meet their annual turnover target called unregretted attrition (URA). A manager's URA target is the percentage of employees the company wouldn't regret seeing leave one way or the other.

The existence of the practice in at least some parts of the company shows how Amazon's system of requiring managers to hit a target attrition goal every year can foster controversial norms and practices.

James Charles' former producer and creative director Kelly Rocklein is speaking out about her lawsuit against him which alleges wrongful termination disability discrimination failure to provide reasonable accommodation and failure to pay minimum wage for overtime hours worked:

In addition to working her more than 80 hours a week without overtime pay according to Rocklein and her complaint Rocklein said Charles seemed ""incredibly unprofessional.""

""Imagine having to go over and essentially pick James up out of bed tell him to brush his teeth tell him 'OK what do you want to eat? OK someone is coming to do your laundry. OK I'm going to get your laundry I guess. OK time to start filming – you don't want to film – well we both know you have to. So please let's think about it'"" Rocklein said.

She also said Charles walked around the house naked in front of her called Rocklein names like ""bitch"" and once texted her ""Kelly i might need your help shaving my butt"" in preparation for a revealing Coachella outfit. Rocklein said Charles made her feel ""extremely uncomfortable.""

In the wake of intense internal debate about issues of race Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke sent an email to managers outlining the company's core beliefs. In it he made clear what the company is not – it is not a government he said and it ""cannot solve every societal problem"":

In the email he said that ""endless Slack trolling victimhood thinking us-vs-them divisiveness and zero sum thinking"" amounted to a ""threat"" that breaks teams. He encouraged managers to stay focused on Shopify's mission of empowering online commerce and entrepreneurship.

A Shopify spokesperson told Insider that the company was not trying to emulate Basecamp in its handling of political issues and that it welcomed discussion of current events.

""As Shopify is growing quickly with new team members joining every day our executive team will often send company-wide messages to remind the organization of our vision for equitable entrepreneurship and to reignite our spirit of positive collaboration"" the spokesperson said. ""This reinforces our need to work together in creating a future that unites not divides.""

More than 20 top mortgage lenders at Wells Fargo have left in the past year while four of the bank's elite President's Club members have left since December. Five current and former mortgage bankers described a culture of heavy oversight and clunky technology that limited their ability to do business:

Tom Goyda a Wells Fargo spokesperson said the exits are due to the competitiveness of the market for mortgage talent.

""We've been in a very competitive mortgage market and top-producing loan offers are in high demand across the industry"" Goyda said. ""Wells Fargo has hired top producers from other lenders and some of our home mortgage consultants have moved to other firms.""

But the mortgage bankers who spoke with Insider pointed to excessive red tape clunky legacy technology and the Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap as factors that stymied loan growth and led them to quit.

When Jeremy Grantham declared in January that ""the long long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully fledged epic bubble"" he said he knew there would be ""a substantial increase in crazy behavior"" before it all came crashing down.

The corporate employees circulated a parody of the “Beverly Hillbillies” theme — featuring “a poor mountaineer barely kept his habit fed” — as reported by the nonprofit news organization Mountain State Spotlight.

“Buy some pills. Take a load home. Y’all come back now y’hear?” the lyrics circulated in 2011 went.

The City of Huntington and the Cabell County Commission are suing three drug distributors — including AmerisourceBergen — in West Virginia federal court. They allege that the companies profited from and promoted the opioid crisis in the state — which has the highest overdose death rate in the nation — by trucking in great quantities of pills.

AmerisourceBergen shipped 90 million doses of the opioids oxycodone and hydrocodone into the state between 2007 and 2012 plus 27 million doses of the benzodiazepine alprazolam or Xanax according to Mountain State Spotlight.

West Virginia’s population as of the 2010 census was 1.85 million.

One executive who forwarded the “pillbillies” parody Chris Zimmerman would later be named chief compliance officer. “It was in a joking manner” Zimmerman testified on Thursday. “The culture at [AmerisourceBergen] is of the highest caliber.”

In a 2012 email on another state’s new drug regulations in another state Cathy Marcum a coworker of Zimmerman wrote: “One of the hillbilly’s [sic] must have learned how to read :-)”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Still HDD capacity sold during the quarter set a new record of 288 exabytes as hyperscalers and enterprises upgraded their storage capabilities. Seagate remained the world's largest maker of hard drives in terms of units and exabytes (EB) shipped.

Nearly 60% of New PCs Use SSDs

The industry shipped as many as 83.981 million PCs in Q1 2021 according to IDC. Meanwhile only about 34.97 million hard drives for consumer PCs were sold last quarter (based on data from Trendfocus) so nearly 60% of personal computers shipped in Q1 used SSDs. This is not particularly surprising as many modern notebooks cannot house a hard drive. In contrast enthusiast and workstation-grade desktops use SSDs because HDDs are rather slow for modern workloads by today's standards.

The industry shipped 14.79 million hard drives for desktops (down 23% quarter-over-quarter) and 20.18 million drives for laptops (down 31.4% QoQ) in Q1 according to Trendfocus. The average capacity of an HDD for a client PC in the first quarter was 1.82TB (2.13TB for desktops 1.58TB for notebooks) so most computers used rather inexpensive hard drives.

64 Million HDDs Sold in Q1

Hard disk drive shipments in the first quarter of 2021 totaled 64.17 million units according to Trendfocus (via StorageNewsletter). Coughlin Associates (via Forbes) estimates that the hard drive TAM (total addressable market) in Q1 2021 was 64.1 million units down from 67.8 million in Q1 2020. Meanwhile Nidec believes that the industry sold 63 million units in the first quarter up from 59 million units in the same quarter a year ago.

Seagate retained its position as the world's leading maker of HDDs with about 27.54 million HDDs sold in the first quarter and 42.9% of the market. Western Digital shipped 23.09 million drives and commanded 36% of the market. Toshiba was the distant No. 3 with 13.54 million HDDs supplied and 21.1% of the market.

Seagate also led in average HDD capacity (5.07TB per drive) and exabytes shipments (139.5EB) in Q1 2021. In contrast the average capacity of a Western Digital hard drive in Q1 was 4.72TB and the company shipped 109.04EB of hard drive storage devices.

Since the remaining three HDD makers don't disclose their detailed unit shipments the numbers published by analysts are basically educated guesses. Meanwhile the first quarter of 2021 did not bring many surprises as far as sales of hard disk drives are concerned so the sales numbers and market shares should be quite accurate.

288 EB ~ 303 EB Shipped in Q1

The general trend for the hard drive market was set several years ago: HDD unit sales are declining while exabyte shipments are growing. Nothing changed in Q1 2021. Trendfocus believes that the total capacity of HDDs shipped by the industry was 288.28EB. By contrast Coughlin Associates estimates that HDDs sold in Q1 2021 can store 303.34EB of data up from 278.03 in Q1 2020.

The lion's share of exabyte shipments belongs to 3.5-inch hard disk drives for servers enterprise nearline and surveillance applications. About 16.05 million of such drives were sold in the first quarter but with an average capacity of 12TB they can store 192.78EB thus commanding 66% of exabytes shipments in Q1 2021.

Console HDDs Are Dropping DAS Remains Strong

Consumer electronics HDDs are a rather large category of storage devices for applications like game consoles direct-attached storage (DAS) digital video recorders (DVRs) and similar things. Shipments of CE HDDs in Q1 2021 totaled 9.95 million units according to both Trendfocus and Coughlin Associates. Meanwhile the industry shipped 14.4 million CE hard drives in Q1 2020 based on data from CA.

Since the latest game consoles from Microsoft and Sony no longer use HDDs it is not surprising that shipments of hard drives for consumer electronics dropped significantly — by 31% — year-over-year.

In fact manufacturers shipped only 2.53 million 2.5-inch CE HDDs with an average capacity of 0.72 TB per unit in Q1 2021. The vast majority of 2.5-inch CE HDDs have been used for game consoles and branded external drives for years. So as production of previous-generation gaming systems from Microsoft and Sony is winding down shipments of 2.5-inchers will decline further.

By contrast sales of 3.5-inch CE HDDs remain strong. Trendfocus says about 7.42 million of these drives shipped during the quarter. An average capacity of a 3.5-inch CE hard drive was about 3.47TB which indicates that most of them were used for various demanding applications such as DAS. Branded DAS with high-capacity HDDs inside seems to be a pretty successful business for HDD makers as many people buy direct-attached storage for their PCs that come with SSDs (which do not always feature enough capacity for things like media).

Enterprise HDDs Booming

Enterprise HDDs have been the one bright spot in recent years. The enterprise-grade HDD category includes various drives for a wide variety of applications including servers (both cloud and on-premise) enterprise NAS nearline and surveillance. In total 19.25 million such HDDs were shipped in Q1 2021 according to Trendfocus.

Surprisingly despite general trends shipments of 2.5-inch enterprise-grade HDDs (which includes legacy 10000/15000 RPM drives) totaled 3.2 million units up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The average capacity of these HDDs was 1.37TB so some legacy datacenters probably upgraded their capacities or just replaced old drives during the quarter.

Sales of 3.5-inch enterprise-grade HDDs exceeded 16 million units and increased sequentially and annually in the first quarter. Enterprise-class 3.5-inchers shipped by the industry in Q1 could store 192.78EB of data and their average capacity now slightly exceeds 12TB.

Meanwhile sales of nearline HDDs for exascalers like AWS and Microsoft Azure are booming. Seagate says that hard drives with 16TB and higher capacities (i.e. 16TB 18TB and 20TB) contributed nearly 50% of its capacity shipments during the quarter (139.5EB) which equals nearly 70EB.

Summary

The HDD market in Q1 2021 brought no surprises and was consistent with trends set in the last five years or so.

Mainstream client PCs are on track to replace HDDs with SSDs but at the same time people are buying more DAS NAS and cloud storage. To that end shipments of client HDDs are declining whereas sales of hard drives for other applications are growing.

Enterprise-grade 3.5-inch HDDs are thriving. Now that data is generated not only by users but by computers themselves (in various forms) demand for storage will only grow and 288EB ~ 303EB of HDD storage shipped in Q1 2021 will increase rather rapidly in the coming quarters.

Another emerging driver for HDD demand is of course Chia Coin cryptocurrency. At press time (on May 8) storage space allocated to the Chia network was nearing 3 exabytes increasing three times from about 1 exabyte at the end of April. From the general market point of view that is slightly over 1% of exabytes shipped in Q1 but it is already hard to acquire a high-capacity HDD at retail. What is going to happen next and whether Chia is set to become a factor that will cause a global shortage of hard drives is something that remains to be seen but signs are not good for general users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMva2Vuc2lsdmVyc3RlaW4vMjAyMS8wNS8xNi90aGUtZGFtLWhhcy1icm9rZW4tYW5kLXdlc3QtdmlyZ2luaWEtaXMtd2FraW5nLXVwLXRvLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Dam Has Broken And West Virginia Has Awoken To Solar Power,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2021/05/16/the-dam-has-broken-and-west-virginia-is-waking-up-to-solar-power/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMva2Vuc2lsdmVyc3RlaW4vMjAyMS8wNS8xNi90aGUtZGFtLWhhcy1icm9rZW4tYW5kLXdlc3QtdmlyZ2luaWEtaXMtd2FraW5nLXVwLXRvLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UtdGVjaC9hcnRpY2xlLzUyNzkwLzEva2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4tc2VjcmV0LWlkZW50aXR5LW5vcnRoLXdlc3QtcGFyb2R5LWFjY291bnQtbm9yaXMtYmxhY2stYm9va9IBiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UtdGVjaC9hcnRpY2xlLzUyNzkwLzEva2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4tc2VjcmV0LWlkZW50aXR5LW5vcnRoLXdlc3QtcGFyb2R5LWFjY291bnQtbm9yaXMtYmxhY2stYm9vaz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian uncovers the secret identity of North West parody account,"The secret identity behind Nori’s Black Book has been a mystery for years at least until now. In the latest episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians Kim and Khloé launched an investigation into the North West parody account which had already racked up hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram (and has since tipped over a million).

The pair originally questioned family friends on whether they’re the one behind the notorious fake account. “Oh my God I f***king wish I was Nori’s Black Book” hairstylist Jen Atkin replies. “My captions aren’t that good.” Kim Kardashian’s former assistant Steph Shepherd also comes under the magnifying glass giving a similar answer. “I think it’s really someone random” Shepherd suggests. “And I don’t think any of your guys’ friends are that funny.

Problems over the societal impact of Big Tech and social media and their effect on values such as privacy have long been a source of public concern.

But companies and campaigners find that resolving them involves navigating the ethics of privacy — a concept that countries nationalities and traditions approach in very different ways.

“Privacy is a nebulous concept generally and over the years we have seen misplaced narratives being framed around it” says Vidushi Marda digital programme officer at ‎Article 19 an international freedom of expression campaign group.

One example is the claim often made by defenders of mass surveillance that it is no threat to privacy if people have “nothing to hide”. “We see some of that changing” explains Marda as policymakers develop a greater understanding of the importance of privacy. This was especially the case she says after whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the scale of mass surveillance by US and other western powers in 2013. Other developments that have shifted attitudes include the scandal over personal data and election influencing involving marketing group Cambridge Analytica; and an investigation by the UK’s information regulator into Clearview AI the controversial facial-recognition system.

At the Big Tech companies the dominant ideas about what online privacy means tend to be western-centric — perhaps unsurprisingly given so many are American.

Nikita Aggarwal

Nikita Aggarwal a research associate at the Oxford Internet Institute’s digital ethics lab compares the western tradition — rooted in Immanuel Kant’s ideas of the individual free will and autonomy — with alternative traditions in other parts of the world that can regard privacy as belonging to communities and groups.

One approach to group privacy is the ‘data trust’ model in which an institution acts as the trustee for users’ data binding it to specific rules to serve the interests of its users.

For example a 2019 pilot scheme in the UK run by the Open Data Institute in collaboration with the Greater London Authority and Royal Borough of Greenwich studied how sharing city data — such as the energy efficiency of social housing — could improve the south London community.

And in a report last December a committee of experts appointed by the Indian government also proposed a “community right over non-personal data” involving data trusts.

“Understanding that variation [in approach] could help us . . . to think differently about the way we manage data-governed technologies” says Aggarwal. She believes a greater emphasis on group-level privacy could allow for better data sharing to protect public safety and public health. “Maybe we need to lessen our obsession with autonomy in the west it may not be serving our best interests.”

But group-level solutions would have to come with high standards of data protection as well as measures to stop mission creep — which remains a risk.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic the Singaporean government set up a contact tracing system reliant on a central database allowing staff to rapidly locate and contact those who may have been exposed to coronavirus. Such a trade-off in personal privacy for the public good may have been deemed acceptable during a crisis but a change in policy now allows the police to access this data.

Marda says: “Knowledge and learnings from the so-called global south are still treated as one-off case studies when they should be contributing towards . . . more nuanced and inclusive conversations.”

Similarly distinctions between Japanese and western conceptions of privacy have long been examined by Rafael Capurro former professor of information management and information ethics at Stuttgart Media University

One key difference says Capurro lies in the conception of “self”. In western tradition this idea values the individual. By contrast in Buddhist tradition the self is viewed as an insubstantial illusory concept not a fixed permanent thing to be guarded.

Attempts to impose western concepts of privacy outside the west can even cause misunderstanding says Marda.

“It’s not just scholars” she says. “In 2010 the Indian government . . . stated ‘India is not a particularly private nation’. This is a trope that we see pervading technical and policy documents at a global level as well.”

Marda says that contrary to claims by the Indian government that privacy is a western concept it is rooted in the country’s legal tradition. “While the words and narrative used may differ from western constructions of privacy the essence of privacy was very much there.”

Academics are now putting much more emphasis on intercultural digital ethics. But it is increasingly difficult to argue that western ideals should be the starting point for ethics in government and business.

And the problem of reconciling the ethical traditions of east and west is more than just academic discourse. China and India combined have a population of about 2.8bn people which poses practical problems for technology companies.

Aggarwal is among a group of experts working to build forums to discuss these questions. Last year she helped organise the first symposium on intercultural digital ethics which brought together philosophers from around the world to consider how to solve some of these challenges. “We don’t have an international treaty on Big Tech so it is trying to help us understand why we do have and should have local approaches [to regulation]” she says.

Marda says the first step for policymakers is to focus on “local context ground realities and cultural legacies”.

“The second is to centre these conversations around stakeholders power and incentives; and the narratives that arise as a consequence of them” she says. She wants scrutiny over the politics that inevitably underpin the design and structure of technologies and systems.

Capurro is optimistic that discussions around intercultural digital ethics are improving and moving beyond the world of academic circles. “[They are] also having a large impact on society at large through social media and particularly through a growing number of Zoom meetings open to a larger audience” he says.

He is optimistic that a more inclusive ethical future is possible: “Different visions of privacy do not necessarily hinder a practical consensus.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGlhLW5ldHdvcmstbm93LXVzZXMtbW9yZS10aGFuLTEtZXhhYnl0ZS1mb3Itc3RvcmFnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chia Currency Has Already Used 1 Exabyte of Storage,"Just when we thought that smart cities smart factories IoT devices autonomous vehicles and robots will be the main generators of data that will require storage space in the coming years Chia Coin cryptocurrency just demonstrated that it will also be a formidable generator of data at least for the time being.

In a about a month's time storage space allocated to Chia network increased from 120PB all the way to 1143PB or 1.14 Exabytes. 1.14EB equals 1140000TB or 63333 20TB hard drives.

Chia is a proof of space-time cryptocurrency that uses storage space on farmers' systems to store a collection of cryptographic numbers called 'plots.' When the blockchain broadcasts a challenge for the next block farmers' systems scan their plots to see if they have the hash that is closest to the challenge. This method eliminates the Proof of Work concept used by Bitcoin and Ethereum therefore lowering vast power requirements for mining which developers of Chia call 'farming.'

Meanwhile the probability of winning a block is the percentage of the total space that a farmer has compared to the entire network which essentially means that someone with more available space has more chances to win. So while accelerators and GPUs are not needed for Chia farming someone with more storage space to host more plots earns more.

At present a minimum size plot requires around 101GB of storage space and 4GB of RAM so when one wants to store 100 K32 plots they need a system with slightly more than 10TB of space which is not too expensive. Meanwhile creation of each plot requires 4GB of DRAM so creating 100 plots in parallel would require 400GB of system memory which cost quite a sum yet almost nobody does it.

One of the moderators of r/Chia at Reddit noted. ""The RAM and storage space used to make the plots is reused to make new plots so one only needs as much SSD space and RAM as needed to create the number of plots they want to create at one time either singularly or in parallel"" he said.

Thousands of Chia farmers now build machines with tens of HDDs that can store tens terabytes of data. While one of such drives does not consume a lot — about 6.5W when operating and about 5.6W when idling — tens of such HDDs can consume hundreds of Watts when they work and usually more when starting up. For example a system with 32 Western Digital HC550 18TB HDDs (like the one pictured above) powered by a monster motherboard with 32 SATA ports can consume around 180W when idling which does not count power consumption of memory and compute modules.

For obvious reasons there are no consumer PC chassis or NAS boxes with 32 3.5-inch bays. Meanwhile rack-based chassis with backplanes for data centers are quite expensive. As a result hardware used for Chia farming is either DIY or designed specifically for this purpose and nothing else. Essentially in just about several months' time a new segment of hardware market for Chia farming has developed.

One recommended way to save power and money is to use Raspberry Pi to farm Chia Coin after you've built the plots on a PC.

It remains to be seen how Chia cryptocurrency mining will develop going forward. But at this rate the amount of storage space used by Chia network will be gargantuan a year from now."

HARRISBURG Pa. — In Australia Erin Williams started her own company to create magic for kids in July 2018.

This magic being entertaining children with Disney-inspired characters and activities.

The Allentown native returned to Pennsylvania from Australia after missing family and friends but she didn't leave her magic formula also known as Magic and Munchkins Entertainment behind.

The company is now starting to hover its wand over the Central Pennsylvania area by hosting birthday parties and events for children featuring some of their favorite characters.

Magic and Munchkins Entertainment has partnered with the Manor at Mountain View in Harrisburg for their debut event Royal Fantasy Faire.

During the event there will be two socially distanced sessions that will include 60 minutes of interactive activities singalong performances dancing character meet and greets refreshments and more.

The event will include the frog and mermaid princesses Cinderella and Rapunzel among others.

Ashley Tietje chief operating officer said the company strives to feature characters that reflect the race and ethnicity of different Disney princesses.

Tiana Raya and Yasmine will be included in their list of inspired characters.

All performers who embody these characters participate in an extensive audition and training process to ensure they match their character's mannerisms physicality and vocal animations according to Williams.

""A lot of Starbucks is what keeps us fueled"" said Williams.""We do a lot of rehearsals almost every weekend we get the girls together. We practice our choreography we have choreographers behind the scenes.""

Williams said quality is important to the company. Princess costumes can range from $1000 to $3000 and it can take nearly a year to bring their characters to life.

Royal Fantasy Faire was originally set for Sunday but was pushed back to July 11. Organizers said this decision was made so more people could get vaccinated before the event.

Session one which is also VIP runs from 11 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. and is $50 per guest with a full meal included.

Session two is general admission will be from 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. and is $35 per guest with light refreshments provided.

"" I mean how often is it that you get to meet your favorite characters the real character because that's what we're all about. It's not just people dressing up. We're actually creating magical memories for families people of all ages"" said Williams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvb2xpdmVyd2lsbGlhbXMxLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvYXJjaGVnb3Mtc3BhcmtzLWZhbWlseS1vZmZpY2UtZmV1ZC1hbW9uZy10aGVpci1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1vd25lcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Archegos Sparks Family Office Feud Among Their Billionaire Owners,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/05/16/archegos-sparks-family-office-feud-among-their-billionaire-owners/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvb2xpdmVyd2lsbGlhbXMxLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvYXJjaGVnb3Mtc3BhcmtzLWZhbWlseS1vZmZpY2UtZmV1ZC1hbW9uZy10aGVpci1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1vd25lcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvcGhhcnJlbGwtd2lsbGlhbXMtaGFwcHktc3VjY2Vzcy0yMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1uZXQtd29ydGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Of Course He's Happy: How Pharrell Williams Became A $200 Million Man,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvcGhhcnJlbGwtd2lsbGlhbXMtaGFwcHktc3VjY2Vzcy0yMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1uZXQtd29ydGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Según los especialistas en análisis de riesgo ese tipo de delitos junto con las catástrofes climáticas son las principales amenazas que enfrenta el sector del Oil & Gas y Vaca Muerta no escapa a esa realidad.

En diálogo con +e Ezequiel Aguirre Leiva responsable Willis Towers Watson Neuquén analiza el contexto actual en que la pandemia genera un terreno fértil para los ciberataques por el aumento del tráfico en las redes y sobre todo en una industria petrolera cada día más digitalizada.

- ¿La industria del petróleo a nivel mundial está siendo blanco de ciberataques?

No hay dudas que los riesgos cibernéticos empiezan a sonar cada vez con más fuerza. Recientemente hubo un caso de gran impacto en la industria norteamericana en donde Colonial Pipeline fue víctima de un ataque cibernético causando enormes consecuencias económicas para ellos el país y el mundo. Vale aclarar que se trata de la mayor operadora de oleoducto de Estados Unidos donde transportan productos refinados a través de los 8.850km de longitud que tiene la red. Sus sistemas fueron hackeados produciendo la interrupción en el suministro de combustible a millones de consumidores empresas y aeropuertos particularmente de la zona este del país. Los hackers atacaron por medio de ransomware y solicitaron rescate por descifrar sistemas corporativos cifrados por ellos mismos.

Este caso se hizo conocido por su notable envergadura pero sabemos que a diario las empresas en todo el mundo son víctimas de ciberdelitos. Esto puede ser a causa del avance tecnológico de los últimos tiempos llevado a automatización de procesos y potenciados por la coyuntura de pandemia. Esto último ha llevado a las empresas en la mayoría de los casos a operar de una forma remota sin darse tiempo suficiente de preparar sus correspondientes sistemas de seguridad en forma previa. Los procesos de negocios se han volcado masivamente a las redes poniendo a disposición de los hackers gran cantidad de datos confidenciales y acceso a los sistemas lo cual ha llevado a las empresas a un nivel de vulnerabilidad considerable.

""Sabemos que a diario las empresas en todo el mundo son víctimas de ciberdelitos. Esto puede ser a causa del avance tecnológico de los últimos tiempos llevado a automatización de procesos y potenciados por la coyuntura de pandemia"".

- ¿Cómo se protege la industria petrolera local contra este tipo de riesgos?

En primer lugar es muy importante que las empresas identifiquen sus activos los cuantifiquen y detecten amenazas asociadas a estos actos. Luego deben diseñar un plan un programa de mitigación del riesgo para forzar un mínimo impacto en caso de ser atacados. Aquí hablamos de incorporar tecnología confeccionar políticas y procedimientos concientizar a los empleados sobre el tema para que no caigan en trampas phishing por ejemplo. Pero lo más importante y lo que nos concierne a nosotros en calidad de asesores en seguros es fomentar la transferencia del riesgo al mercado asegurador. Hay compañías que ofrecen el producto ajustado a la necesidad de cada cliente.

Se trata de una póliza con amparos de pérdidas de terceros tales como los reclamos que éstos puedan presentar por la publicación y divulgación de su información confidencial el incumplimiento de la ley de protección de datos o la violación de su propiedad intelectual y con amparos de pérdidas propias del asegurado como la pérdida de ingresos derivada de una interrupción de la red o la reconstrucción de los activos digitales debido a delitos informáticos sabotaje de empleados errores operativos y administrativos además de extorción cibernética. También considera en sus textos cobertura por daños reputacionales a fin de ayudar a la empresa afectada a recuperar sus niveles de prestigio en la sociedad. Y muy importante las aseguradoras que ofrecen este producto ponen a disposición un equipo de profesionales que permanentemente están resolviendo casos de ciberataques en todo el mundo. Esto es fundamental para responder rápido a un ataque y afectar lo menos posible la continuidad del negocio.

- ¿Las operaciones en Vaca Muerta pueden ser objetivo de este tipo de ataques?

Vaca Muerta es uno de los principales faros de proyección económica que tiene la argentina. Si bien la pandemia causo retrasos en su desarrollo continúa siendo un área estratégica para el crecimiento de nuestro país. En la operación del petróleo y gas intervienen muchas empresas que trabajan mancomunadamente para extraer el hidrocarburo y comercializarlo. También hay industrias que dependen del combustible generado en la cuenca para poder producir como así también millones de consumidores que lo utilizamos a diario. Cualquier ataque cibernético que genere interrupción en la red seguramente traerá consecuencias importantes.

Es preciso aclarar que las operaciones de perforación wire line fractura entre otras están monitoreados en forma remota con lo cual son muchos los datos que están subidos a la red por los cuales se toman decisiones para continuar con la actividad.

Algunas de esas operaciones están las 24 horas del día activas. Datos tales como presión caudal densidad del fluido dirección del pozo etc. son fundamentales para lograr eficiencia en la operación por lo tanto cualquier ataque cibernético que altere la información puede causar contratiempos y dolores de cabeza.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Poker players are starting to look each other in the eye again.

The plexiglass dividers that have been a staple of Las Vegas poker rooms during the coronavirus pandemic have come down this week at several casinos after they were approved to return to 100 percent capacity by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The Orleans on Saturday became the latest poker room to remove its plexiglass.

“It is down as of early this morning!” Orleans poker room manager Garrett Okahara said via email.

Poker rooms that have removed the plexiglass include the Caesars Entertainment properties (Bally’s Caesars Palace Flamingo and Planet Hollywood Resort); MGM Resorts properties (Aria Bellagio and MGM Grand); Station Casinos properties (Boulder Station Red Rock Resort and Santa Fe Station); and Wynn Las Vegas (room located in Encore).

The Golden Nugget South Point and The Venetian still have plexiglass in place.

The removal of plexiglass dividers signals a return to normalcy for poker in Las Vegas after it was upended along with most other pastimes by the pandemic.

Casinos reopened June 5 after the initial shutdown because of the pandemic in March 2020 and the Orleans and South Point immediately brought back their poker rooms. The Venetian followed the next day and more rooms gradually came back over the next few months.

Games started with four players allowed at each table under social distancing guidelines then five-handed games were quickly approved. While many poker players returned to action the games were a far cry from the normal nine- and 10-handed tables.

The Bellagio opened a new phase of pandemic poker when it installed plexiglass dividers that allowed six-handed games starting June 18. The other poker rooms quickly followed suit.

Eventually regulators allowed rooms to offer eight-handed games with dividers and that remained the standard until this week.

So far most of the rooms that have removed the dividers have chosen to stick with eight-handed play instead of reverting to the normal nine or 10. The Wynn is playing nine-handed and the Orleans said it would go to nine-handed for tournaments while sticking with eight-handed for cash games.

“Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year” the Orleans poker room posted on Twitter.

Good morning poker players! With the recent removal of our plexiglass dividers tournaments at the Orleans will be played 9-handed effective immediately. Cash games will still be 8-handed for the time being. Thank you all for your patience and understanding over this last year. — OrleansPokerRoom (@OrleansPokerRo1) May 15 2021

With face masks now optional at many resorts for fully vaccinated patrons poker this summer could look like what it was before the pandemic.

Henderson poker pro and YouTube personality Jeff Sluzinski who goes by Jeff Boski online hailed the removal of plexiglass Friday.

“A timeless moment in poker history” he said on Twitter.

It was it goes without saying a groundbreaking piece of analysis from a finely tuned hockey mind.

Caught up in the drama and minutia of several 82-game seasons how many of us could possibly have noticed that Minnesota hadn’t iced a big-time NHL scorer since Marian Gaborik ran away to the big city?

You’re welcome.

That 2019 Wild team didn’t make the playoffs of course but playoff hockey returns to Minnesota on Sunday when the third-seeded Wild play the second-seeded Vegas Golden Knights in a 2 p.m. puck drop in Las Vegas. Minnesota hasn’t won a first-round playoff series since 2015 which actually feels much longer ago because until this year the Wild had made the postseason only two more times and when they got there barely fired a shot — straight or otherwise.

Why expect this year to be any different?

That 2019 Wild team was the NHL’s third-worst shooting team a combined 8.4 percent. This season the Wild were the league’s second-best shooting team tied with Washington at 11.4 percent behind Pittsburgh’s 11.5. Two years ago Matt Dumba (12.9) and Zach Parise (12.23) were the Wild’s best shooters; this year’s team has eight players with at least 40 shots who are shooting better.

Among them is rookie winger Kirill Kaprisov the kind of player we haven’t seen since Gaborik on pace for 40 goals and about 76 points in an 82-game season. Second on the team with 157 shots Kaprizov has scored on 17.2 percent of them.

Gaborik finished the 2002-03 regular season 30-35—65 in 81 games but he was even better in the postseason with nine goals and eight assists in 18 games as the Wild upset Colorado and Vancouver in the first two rounds before getting shut down in a four-game sweep by goaltender J-S Giguere and the Anaheim (Mighty) Ducks.

That now-legendary run — not just a surprise but the Wild’s only deep playoff run in 20 seasons — tends to be associated with the veterans who joined the expansion franchise and played postseason: Andrew Brunette Wes Walz Darby Hendrickson. But it was Gaborik who led the team in postseason scoring.

In Kaprizov the Wild finally have a guy who can take over a series. Maybe not quite as fast as Gaborik was in his prime he is better with his stick and a more imaginative scorer.

No one would blame the skeptical. Since making their unexpected run to the Western Conference Final in 2003 the Wild have won three — three! — second-round playoff games. In their past two postseason appearances they won two — two! — first-round games. So expecting it to be different even in an anomaly of a season as this 56-game campaign isn’t wise.

Still it feels different. The Wild didn’t have to sweat out a playoff spot late and with early postseason play confined to division opponents they drew their best matchup when Colorado slipped ahead of Vegas in the regular-season finale. Minnesota was 5-1-2 against the Golden Knights this season and is 11-2-3 against the 2018 Western Conference champions.

More important the Wild are finally a different team than the one the franchise brass kept insisting was a Stanley Cup contender. Ryan Suter and Zach Parise remain but it appears Parise will be the odd wing out. And while Joel Erikkson Ek and Jordan Greenway were always part of the plan gone are Mikael Granlund Charlie Coyle Nino Niederreiter and most conspicuously Mikko Koivu who came to exemplify the Wild’s collective personality as a defensively responsible team that would win with greasy goals.

None of this means a thing if the Wild don’t play well of course but at least it feels different this season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTYvY29sb3JhZG8tY29hbC1jbG9zdXJlcy1lY29ub21pYy1pbXBhY3Qv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVudmVycG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xNi9jb2xvcmFkby1jb2FsLWNsb3N1cmVzLWVjb25vbWljLWltcGFjdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colorado’s coal country searches for “the next thing” to keep communities afloat,"

“They want the story behind the story” Palmer said. “The story is our enrollment is down.”

There are 309 high schoolers between the two towns. It’ll drop to 292 in 2024 and after that well Palmer doesn’t want to go there. The enrollment reflects the rapid decline of the mining industry around here; in 2010 there were 426 students and three coal mines. Now there’s just one mine.

It presents profound challenges particularly for the workers who relied on coal which has always been boom-bust but this time isn’t coming back. Paonia officials estimate that every coal job has represented at least five other jobs in the area. The Colorado communities that have relied on coal find a way to replace billions of dollars in revenue and stave off barren main streets.

“Reality starts to set in” Palmer said. “We don’t have the support for the mines. And those other services that supported mining are no longer. It’s tough. Tough.”

Colorado’s state government has made a promise not to leave behind the more than 1000 people directly impacted by coal closures — and the thousands more indirectly affected like electricians truck drivers security workers and others who serve the mines and plants. It approved the Office of Just Transition in 2019 to help with retraining or relocating coal workers or paying them to retire early. (The office plans to expand into oil and gas in coming years.)

But this project isn’t something many people in coal-mining areas are even aware of according to interviews with workers around the state. In fact it’s only now getting any real resources: a couple employees approved in the 2021-22 state budget; a possible $15 million in seed funding through HB21-1290; and an extra $5 million annually through HB21-1312’s proposed elimination of corporate tax breaks.

“We are not going to insulate the state from change. Let’s be very clear about that” said Sen. Chris Hansen a Denver Democrat who works closely at the Capitol on energy policy. “This is not going to be ‘Hey we want everything to be like it was in 1975 and it’ll always be that way.’ We have to help communities reinvent themselves find the next thing.”

“Still trying to get our arms around it”

Colorado currently has seven coal-fired power plants and six coal mines the largest of which is West Elk in Somerset just east of Paonia. By 2030 the state expects there will be just one unit of one coal-fired power plant left — Comanche 3 in Pueblo — and anywhere from one to three mines.

It’s Wade Buchanan’s job to oversee the Office of Just Transition and figure out among other things how many workers the state will need to help across the 11 counties that are most likely to see the impacts. The state has no working estimate for how many will be indirectly affected by the coming job losses.

Montrose Moffat Routt Rio Blanco Morgan and Pueblo counties are the highest priority and there are 1129 coal workers in those places now the state estimates. The second tier includes 562 people in Delta (home to the North Fork Valley) El Paso Larimer Gunnison and La Plata counties.

“We are still trying to get our arms around it” said Buchanan who is the we in that statement. He’s the sole employee of the office so far. “It’s not because we haven’t been trying but just because there’s one of us and we’re trying to be as accurate as possible.”

There’s real urgency in the counties seeing the decline. Take Rick McGaughey who on May 7 shut down Hays Drug Store a prominent feature of Paonia’s main drag. For the first time in 115 years Paonia doesn’t have a pharmacy and the owners aren’t sure where they fit in.

“Things evolve and they change and I’m not anti-change” McGaughey said. “But you have to maintain a cohesive community. Right now that’s really not there.”

Unlike other coal towns this one isn’t dying. Paonia’s housing market is hot as retirees second-home owners and remote workers have moved in driving up prices by double from a decade ago. There’s a vibrant agribusiness and tourism scene with fruit orchards and wineries and ranching.

“Having millions of dollars in payroll coming in fortified the community” McGaughey said of the mining jobs which paid $100000 or more on average. “Now we have a lot of other workers we have fiber internet. And why not come here? It’s a beautiful place and a lot of people can work from here.

“But they aren’t out and about and a part of the community. The coal miners were volunteer firemen volunteer EMTs.”

The transition is evident in downtown with the recent proliferation of shops selling succulent plants and other things that as McGaughey’s friend Kim Johnson puts it “you like but don’t need.” Time was this downtown had three hardware stores and a stoplight — the latter you now have to drive 25 miles away to find.

Johnson’s husband Chris used to load coal into two trains each with dozens of cars every day. Then it was one or two trains a week and eventually he was laid off. The couple got by on 401(k) money and reinvented themselves as counselors. Their six kids moved away.

“People knew each other — a wonderful spirit of community” Kim Johnson said. “You drive through town today you don’t know most people.”

“This has killed my district”

A hot housing market means stable property tax revenues but not every town has that. State Rep. Perry Will serves Moffat Garfield and Rio Blanco counties north of Paonia and has seen what happens when coal declines and new business and people don’t move in.

“This has killed my district” the Republican said flatly. He has little hope where he lives for the kind of reinvigoration happening now in Paonia.

In some counties the coal industry is the largest taxpayer among all residential and commercial plots. It accounts for nearly half of property tax revenues in Moffat County. The state estimates it will take nearly $3.2 billion in new commercial property value — 10 times the value of the Denver Broncos’ stadium — to replace the cumulative tax revenue losses in Colorado’s coal counties.

Other Republicans who mainly represent the affected areas initially scoffed at the idea of an Office of Just Transition calling it an insult and rejecting that a renewable-energy transition was inevitable. Now they’re coming around with Will and Republican Sen. Bob Rankin of Carbondale sponsoring the funding bill. It’s the best available option and fighting the transition has proved pointless they said.

The few left in the mining business want to stick around — people like Mike Ludlow president of Oxbow Mining outside Paonia. He’s one of three workers at the shuttered Elk Creek Mine. There used to be 380.

It’ll take several years for those three to restore the former mine site to its original state before closing entirely. His colleague Doug Smith stood next to him outside of a large office on site that’s filled with a lot of empty space and photos of the old days.

“I show up til they tell me not to show up anymore” said Smith who’s been laid off before. “I just keep waiting for someone to say OK don’t come tomorrow.”

Some of their former coworkers stuck around in the valley. Others moved to Utah or Wyoming. Ludlow told a story from years ago when he worked for a Colorado company that shut down mines in Kentucky.

“They transferred 35 families from Kentucky to Colorado paid for all their expenses paid them for relocation” Ludlow said. “One family stayed all the rest went home.

“Not everybody is willing to relocate in new places. Some people have very deep strong roots.”

Xcel Energy which operates three of the state’s coal-fired plants recognizes this said Hollie Velasquez Horvath senior director of state affairs and community relations in Colorado. Xcel believes they can retrain many of the 300 workers at those plants to do new jobs where they live.

But there’s a catch she said especially in places like Hayden an hour’s drive from the Wyoming border.

“We can’t put solar farms and wind farms up there and make it up” she said. “We’ve got to be more creative.”

“This is not a dodge”

For all the fears already realized and families displaced Colorado is at the vanguard of a national “just transition” effort which is gaining popularity among unions. Colorado’s is a first-of-its-kind project said Dennis Dougherty executive director of the AFL-CIO of Colorado and chair of the Just Transition Advisory Committee.

“We have a chance to make sure communities don’t become ghost towns” he told lawmakers this month. “We heard from those in Craig and Hayden — they don’t want to leave. They love the quality of life where they are. No bones about it.”

Much of the $15 million pending in the legislature would be put to stimulate economic transitions in local communities. House Majority Leader Daneya Esgar from Pueblo said Colorado needs to support those communities hiring people like Wade Buchanan to figure out their respective next thing. Rankin said it’s critical the state let the locals lead on that not the other way around.

Spreading $15 million around the state won’t go far. Even the bill sponsors acknowledge that. A report released Dec. 31 by the state’s Just Transition Advisory Committee made no illusions about the state’s readiness or lack thereof to cure coal country.

The report is filled with lofty goals — empower families and communities attract new investment in struggling areas — but also “defers until later those decisions that might drive the higher costs we do not yet know how to pay.”

“This is not a dodge” the report states. “It is an honest and responsible reflection of the times we are in.”

Some in the labor community think the state should prepare to put $100 million a year toward this effort for at least about five years. Even the low-end estimates — Esgar said she’s thinking more in the tens of millions but that it’s too soon to say — are expensive.

None of the more than dozen elected officials and labor and industry leaders interviewed for this story could yet offer a projection of how much the state energy customers and the owners of the plants and mines will each need to pitch in. Gov. Jared Polis declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed on the present and future costs though in a statement he said “some people will lose job they like and communities will lose major employers. We have to do what we can to make sure they have a bright future.”

Chief among the priorities according to Frances Koncilja who from 2016-20 served as one of the state’s three top energy-sector regulators is figuring out all the dominoes that might fall.

“There needs to be a complete understanding of what the closure will mean in terms of jobs lost careers lost schools closed property tax lost and they need to figure out how that total sum is going to be paid to the community” said Koncilja adding “It is a real hard thing for these folks but it’s not too late.”

It’s too late for Paonia High of course so Principal Palmer’s looking ahead. Combining the schools means being able to keep staff employed and continuing student programs like music and FFA that might’ve otherwise faced cuts. It won’t be the same as it was he said but it’ll be something new and good and hopefully sustainable.

And when the Paonia Eagles and Hotchkiss Bulldogs merge late this summer they’ll nod to the region’s vanishing identity with a new nickname: the Miners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9tYXkvMTYvZ29sZGVuLWtuaWdodHMtbGV0LWRvd24tZ29hbGllLWZsZXVyeS1pbi1nYW1lLTEtbG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Knights let down goalie Fleury in Game 1 loss to Wild,"Golden Knights let down goalie Fleury in Game 1 loss to Wild

Comic-book writers have long grappled with how to even the odds against an all-powerful protagonist: If Superman can do everything how do you stop him?

That must have been how the Minnesota Wild felt going against Marc-Andre Fleury on Sunday.

The Golden Knights netminder turned in a heroic performance diving one minute to glove down a one-timer then sliding across the crease to get a finger on a quick strike the next. It took a shot from the most dangerous area of the ice to beat him in a 1-0 overtime defeat and even then the puck had to bounce off a teammate’s skate.

Fleury was spectacular. The Vegas offense not so much.

The Golden Knights fired 42 shots at the net but none of them made it there and Joel Eriksson Ek’s overtime winner for the Wild off Alec Martinez’s skate was the only goal of the game as Vegas fell into a one-game series deficit.

“It’s disappointing we couldn’t the win couldn’t score one goal for him” Vegas captain Mark Stone said. “I didn’t really expect anything different he plays great for us every night.”

There’s a long list of Fleury saves that will end up on the highlight reels but the best was when he denied rookie sensation Kirill Kaprizov in the third period. Kaprizov glided to the net shifted from his backhand to his forehand and went in tight on Fleury.

Fleury was caught off guard. He initially darted to his left then had to change direction to protect the right post. It was clear he did everything he could to get to the puck evidenced by his back arching and fully extending his stick hand just getting a finger on the shot.

“I just tried to push as quickly as I could and I got a piece on the finger” Fleury said. “So it was close but it was a nice feeling to get that one.

He particularly haunted Minnesota forward Ryan Hartman whose five shots tied for Wild’s team lead. He said after the game Fleury “baits” players into shooting for the glove and was clearly beating himself up about it.

But he also gets to go home frustrated in himself but pleased with the team result — unlike several Golden Knights. It was the fourth time in franchise playoff history that Vegas has been shutout in a playoff game.

It missed a strong opportunity in the first period when the Golden knights led 19-5 in shots on goal and held the Wild without a shot for the final 8:27 of the frame. The Golden Knights’ volume shooting approach didn’t work as Minnesota Cam Talbot made 19 saves many of them without much difficulty.

“We’ve got to find ways to score” Stone said. “It’s not just finding those dirty areas. You’ve got to find loose pucks. We’ve got to make plays. You can’t just rely on taking 40 45 shots. When you get the grade As you’ve got to bear down and score. And we had lots of those.”

In the first period the Golden Knights had 14 scoring chances and six high-danger chances in the first period according to Natural Stat Trick. In the second third and overtime combined they had 15 scoring chances and six high-danger chances.

“I think for me the first one is critical” coach Pete DeBoer said. “To come out of the first period with the type of pressure we put on and not have anything to show for it was probably the biggest disappointment because they regrouped and the rest of the game was pretty even.”

The good news is the Golden Knights historically have taken Game 1 losses in stride and come out firing in Game 2. They have lost three Game 1s all-time and in all those instances won the next game and doing so each time by multiple goals.

The bad news is they’ll need a good game. The Golden Knights have never beaten the Wild on the road in regulation (one shootout win and one 3-on-3 win) and will need to win at least once at Xcel Energy Center to win the series.

Much has been made all season about Vegas’ goaltending duo and DeBoer said it was an “easy decision” to go with Fleury considering the season he just wrapped up.

Fleury was spectacular Sunday afternoon but it doesn’t matter if it’s Fleury in net or Robin Lehner or prime Dominik Hasek Vegas isn’t going anywhere if it can’t score.

“We’ve got to find another goal tonight somewhere somehow at some point prior to it getting to overtime” DeBoer said. “We’ll look for some answers there. And for me just get a rest. That’s going to take a lot out of you physically when you lose a game like that. Mentally too. It’s nice to have a day tomorrow to regroup.”

Game 2 is 7 p.m. Tuesday at T-Mobile Arena.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvdGhlLW1hbnktY2xpY2hlcy1vZi13aWxkLWNvYWNoLWRlYW4tZXZhc29uLWFuZC1ob3ctdGhleS1jaGFuZ2VkLXRoZS1jdWx0dXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The many cliches of Wild coach Dean Evason (and how they changed the culture),"Fifteen months ago Wild general manager Bill Guerin made the decision to fire longtime coach Bruce Boudreau. That move came on Valentine’s Day 2020 to be exact and immediately launched a shotgun wedding with interim coach Dean Evason that has somehow worked out better than anyone could have imagined.

After officially having the interim tag removed before the NHL restart last summer Evason has slowly but surely taken the Wild to a higher level. It has helped of course that star rookie Kirill Kaprizov has simultaneously taken the league by storm almost singlehandedly changing the narrative surrounding the Wild on a national stage.

Still there’s a reason the 56-year-old Evason is going to be a legitimate contender for the Jack Adams Award which goes to the league’s coach of the year.

It would be hard to find a coach who has been better than Evason at pushing the right buttons at the right time this season. His latest test comes at 2 p.m. Sunday when the Wild open the first round of the playoffs against the Golden Knights in Las Vegas.

“You have to find your own personality as a coach” Evason said. “You pick up different things throughout your experiences from coaches that you’ve played for coaches that you’ve coached with and coaches that you’ve coached against.”

ADVERTISEMENT

All of those experiences have helped Evason develop his own voice behind the bench. He has led with a consistent message a no-nonsense approach and a long list of cliches that show up almost every time he steps in front of the camera.

Seriously go back and listen to some of Evason’s press conferences from the past 15 months. He leans on the same phrases time after time to get his point across and it seems his players have very clearly bought in.

Here’s a deep dive into the cliches — or better yet the Evason-isms — that have changed the culture in the Twin Cities.

‘A Minnesota Wild teammate’

Translation: In a league obsessed with line combinations Evason has consistently hammered home the notion that anybody can play with anybody else in the lineup.



This came into focus about a week after Evason took over last season. With the Wild locked in a hotly contested game against the Edmonton Oilers on Feb. 21 2020 Evason purposefully put his lines in a blender so to speak.

It was done partially to spark the team in that particular game and partially to send a message about what to expect in the future.

“We hadn’t done anything with the lines up to that point after we took over and in that game we had them all over the place” Evason recalled. “That was the message after the game. It doesn’t matter who guys play with. We flipped the lines around. Who cares? You’re playing with a teammate. We tried to set that standard right away and it’s carried on into this season.”

Indeed. Literally anytime Evason has been asked about his first second third or fourth line this season he has reminded reporters that “it doesn’t matter who a guy is playing next to as long as he’s playing next to a Minnesota Wild teammate.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Though it might have induced some eye rolls early on the more Evason used that exact phrase the more his players clearly started to believe it.

A perfect example is the Jordan Greenway-Joel Eriksson Ek-Marcus Foligno line that has been so productive for the Wild this season. That combination came to fruition through trial and error and only worked because each player was willing to be moved around in the lineup.

“We were playing with a lot of different guys” Foligno said. “You just have to be ready. If we go in and check the board and see the lines have been mixed up a little bit it’s not a negative thing. It’s always been a positive thing with our team. We just want to play our best and help our teammates out and find chemistry with whoever.”

Maybe the biggest thing that has helped Evason get through to his players is that he rewards playing based on who’s playing well on that particular night. If the Nick Bonino-Nico Sturm-Nick Bjugstad line is rolling Evason has no problem sending them over the boards regardless of the situation.

“It’s a very positive thing for our group that they have bought into it and embraced it” Evason said. “We don’t have a guy pouting about not being on this line or that line or being upset that he’s not playing with so and so. That doesn’t come into our room. There’s no distractions. The players deserve a heck of a lot of credit for that.”

‘We don't have a rotation’

Translation: While it is common place to have a designated starter and a backup in goal Evason has bucked that trend keeping the focus on veteran Cam Talbot and rookie Kaapo Kahkonen as a collective.

It’s no secret that Talbot has emerged as the No. 1 option for the Wild during the final weeks of the regular season. But Evason has made a point to mention Kahkonen whenever he gets a chance.

That’s by design and it has filtered down to the rest of the team. Ask captain Jared Spurgeon about Talbot and he will immediately bring up Kahkonen. Ask skilled winger Kevin Fiala about Kahkonen and he will immediately bring up Talbot.

“We don’t have a rotation” Evason said earlier this season. “We don’t have anything scheduled. It’s game by game. We see where we’re at after that game and where the goaltenders are at and where the team is at. Then we try to make the intelligent decision.”

Are the Wild actually going to roll with both goaltenders in the playoffs? Not a chance. But the fact that Evason has made it about the tandem rather than the individuals has instilled confidence for both players. And that has extended to the rest of the team.

“We have a ton of confidence in both of them” veteran defenseman Ian Cole said. “These guys have done their job to a fantastic degree. We are very fortunate. It’s probably going to take both goaltenders to go on a run here and we are very lucky to have a couple of guys that are playing great.”

If the Wild go on a deep playoff run like they hope both Talbot and Kahkonen will have to be sharp. Nonetheless it’s clear the players feel comfortable regardless of who is in net.

“We make the decision with either guy and nobody is coming to our room like ‘Why are we doing that?’ ” Evason said. “They work their butts off no matter if it’s in a practice or in a game. They gain the respect of their peers and teammates that way. That allows their teammates to have confidence in them moving forward.”

‘Get the heck away from the rink’

Translation: During the hectic condensed 56-game schedule Evason has placed a premium on rest giving his players more days off than ever before.

With the Wild playing pretty much every other night for the past couple of months Evason has cancelled almost every practice on the schedule. As far as he is concerned relaxing at home can be just as valuable as going through a drill on the ice.

“It’s nice to get the heck away from the rink” Evason said. “I don’t think there’s big enough value put in actually staying away from the arena. I think a lot of times we get caught up in ‘We need to have a meeting. We need to have a video. We need to do this.’ Sometimes we need to forget about hockey and take a day to completely clear ourselves then come back ready to go.”

It’s something that impacted Evason as a player. He remembers how practices often took more of a mental toll than a physical toll. Even something as simple as driving to the rink can bring down the energy level.

That awareness is something specific the players have pointed to when asked about Evason pushing the right buttons this season.

“They knew we’d be playing a lot of games in a short schedule here” center Victor Rask said. “The’ve been doing a pretty good job of getting days off for us. Just getting rest is very important.”

It’s likely that the Wild will continue to place a premium on rest in the playoffs. They scheduled a workout for Saturday morning at Xcel Energy Center and there’s a chance that could be the final practice of the season.

“The old school way is ‘If we don’t skate we aren’t getting better’ ” veteran defenseman Ryan Suter said. “I think the studies are showing that rest is a weapon and time away from the rink is a good thing. It’s proven to be a positive for us. Hopefully moving forward we learn from this and continue with it.”

‘Leave it behind and go forward’

Translation: This is basically Evason’s spin on the one-game-at-a-time approach so often used throughout sports.

While this isn’t unique to Evason he has done an effective job getting his players to believe the message. Just look at how the players have approached each game over the past few weeks.

Though the Wild clinched a playoff berth three weeks ago back on April 24 players have made it a point not to overlook any game on the schedule. It was pretty effective despite the two blowout losses at St. Louis to conclude the regular season this week.

“It’s not perfect” Evason said. “It’s a constant battle. But we’ve been real happy with the way the guys have conducted themselves day after day throughout the season. No matter if it’s good or bad we leave it behind and go forward.”

That mindset has helped the Wild steadily improve throughout this season. They have kept their focus on the playoffs while making sure not to skip any steps along the way.

“That’s the way the season has gone since Game 1” Spurgeon said. “We’ve done a good job of going day by day whether it’s a practice or a game. We just focus on that day and then turn the page. Whether it’s a win or loss we’ve done a good job putting it aside and focusing on the next game.”

‘It's not the coaches. It's the players’

Translation: Ever since he’s taken over Evason has made it clear to his players that it’s their locker room not his.

There have been countless times throughout this season that Evason has opted against giving a pregame speech. Instead he has handed the room over to Spurgeon and the rest of the team. As Evason has reminded reporters so often “It’s not the coaches. It’s the players.”

“It’s been good” Spurgeon said. “Especially this season with so many games in a short amount of time I think sometimes meetings can get repetitive if we’re playing the same team a couple of times in a row. Just to have the freedom to speak up as players has been good.”

It’s not something Evason does before every game. Like a true tactician he picks his spots and more often than not it works out for the best.

“When a coach kind of throws it on our shoulders we as players want that pressure and we want that responsibility” Foligno said. “We’ve always seemed to respond when Dean has done it.”

Take a recent overtime win over the Anaheim Ducks. With the Wild struggling to sustain offense throughout the game players took the lead on the bench and started to remind each other what needed to be done.

“They said all the right things on the bench” Evason said. “We asked them if they got tired of hearing themselves say ‘Don’t turn the puck over.’ ”

That statement is Evason in a nutshell. While he has instilled these values in the Wild ever since taking over — with his long list of cliches serving as the blueprint — he always makes sure his players get the credit first and foremost.

“You have to stay firm with what you believe in and we’ve done that as a coaching staff right from Day 1” he said. “Hopefully we can stay consistent going forward.”",,,

An Oxford Economics and NTT DATA survey of 1000 business leaders conducted in early 2020 reveals that 96% of companies were at least researching AI solutions and over 70% had either fully implemented or at least piloted the technology.

Nearly half of survey respondents said failure to implement AI would cause them to lose customers with 44% reporting their company’s bottom line would suffer without it.

Simply put AI enables companies to parse vast quantities of business data to make well-informed and critical business decisions fast. And the transportation management industry specifically is using this intelligence and its companion technology machine learning (ML) to gain greater process efficiency and performance visibility driving impactful changes bolstering the bottom line.

Tools reduce costs increase revenue

McKinsey research reveals that 61% of executives report decreased costs and 53% report increased revenues as a direct result of introducing AI into their supply chains. For supply chains lower inventory-carrying costs inventory reductions and lower transportation and labor costs are some of the biggest areas for savings captured by high volume shippers. Further AI boost supply chain management revenue in sales forecasting spend analytics and logistics network optimization.

For the trucking industry and other freight carriers AI is being effectively applied to transportation management practices to help reduce the amount of unprofitable empty miles or “deadhead” trips a carrier makes returning to domicile with an empty trailer after delivering a load. AI also identifies other hidden patterns in historical transportation data to determine the optimal mode selection for freight most efficient labor resource planning truck loading and stop sequences rate rationalization and other process improvement by applying historical usage data to derive better planning and execution outcomes.

The ML portion of this emerging technology helps organizations optimize routing and even plan for weather-driven disruptions. Through pattern recognition for instance ML helps transportation management professionals understand how weather patterns affected the time it took to carry loads in the past then considers current data sets to make predictive recommendations.

Pandemic accelerates adoption of AI and ML

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) put a tremendous amount of pressure on many industries – the transportation industry included – but it also presented a silver lining -- the opportunity for change. Since organizations are increasingly pressed to work smarter to fulfill customers’ expectations and needs there is increased appetite to retire inefficient legacy tools and invest in new processes and tech tools to work more efficiently.

Applying AI and ML to pandemic-posed challenges can be the critical difference between accelerating or slowing growth for transportation management professionals. When applied correctly these technologies improve logistics visibility offer data-driven planning insights and help successfully increase process automation.

Like many emerging technologies promising transformation AI and ML have in many cases been misrepresented or worse overhyped as panaceas for vexing industry challenges. Transportation logistics organizations should be prudent and perform due diligence when considering when and how to introduce AI and ML to their operations. Panicked hiring of data scientists to implement expensive complicated tools and overengineered processes can be a costly boondoggle and can sour the perception of the viability of these truly powerful and useful tech tools. Instead organizations should invest time in learning more about the technology and how it is already driving value for successful adopters in the transportation logistics industry. What are some steps a logistics operation should take as they embark on an AI/ML initiative?

Data quality should come first

Remember that the quality of your data will drive how fast or slow your AI journey will go. The lifeblood of an effective AI program (or any big data project) is proper data hygiene and management. Unfortunately compiling organizing and accessing this data is a major barrier for many. According to a survey conducted by O’Reilly 70% of respondents report that poorly labeled data and unlabeled data are a significant challenge. Other common data quality issues respondents cited include poor data quality from third-party sources (~42%) disorganized data stores and lack of metadata (~50%) and unstructured difficult-to-organize data (~44%).

Historically slow-to-adopt technology the transportation industry has recently begun realizing the imperative and making up ground with 60% of an MHI and Deloitte poll respondents expecting to embrace AI in the next five years. Gartner predicts that by the end of 2024 75% of organizations will move from piloting to operationalizing AI driving a five times increase in streaming data and analytics infrastructures.

For many transportation management companies accessing cleansing and integrating the right data to maximize AI will be the first step. AI requires large volumes of detailed data and varied data sources to effectively identify models and develop learned behavior.

Review capabilities and consider getting help

Before jumping on the AI bandwagon too quickly companies should assess the quality of their data and current tech stacks to determine what intelligence capabilities are already embedded.

And when it comes to investing in newer technologies to pave the path toward digital transformation choose AI-driven solutions that do not require you to become a data scientist.
