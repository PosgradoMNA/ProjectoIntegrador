When Customs and Border Protection Narcotics dog Bico alerted authorities to a large shipment of cereal on Feb. 13 it probably didn’t come as a surprise when the white powder and grayish substance covering the flakes were not frosting.

After all Cincinnati Port Director Richard Gillespie said drug smugglers will hide narcotics in anything imaginable.

Authorities tested the substances and learned the 44-pound shipment of Corn Flakes had been coated with cocaine valued at $2822400.

But thanks to Border Patrol agents and their K-9 the Peruvian shipment was stopped before it could reach the destined private residence in Hong Kong.

""The men and women at the Port of Cincinnati are committed to stopping the flow of dangerous drugs and they continue to use their training intuition and strategic skills to prevent these kinds of illegitimate shipments from reaching the public"" Gillespie said in a news release.

Agents are regularly nixing outrageous and bizarre smuggling attempts.

In the week since the Cincinnati attempt officers in Fort Lauderdale seized luggage filled with cocaine and agents in Miami’s airport busted a suspect for trying to smuggle cocaine inside a pair of sandals.

Last year Border Patrol seized 3677 pounds of narcotics at ports of entry on a typical day.

He has lived a storied life.

1 - THE LIFE-CHANGING DECISION

Born in 1960 Greg Louganis was abandoned by his teenage parents before he could walk. He was taken in by a family in the suburbs of San Diego and showed an early appetite and aptitude for athletic endeavours particularly those that were rhythmically and acrobatically challenging. However it was their decision to install a swimming pool in their garden in 1969 that changed the trajectory of Louganis’ life. At nine Louganis began to dive. His mother concerned for his safety sent him for lessons at a local swimming pool. His story began with that decision.

2 – A NEW ERA

Before Louganis there was Dibiasi. Klaus Dibiasi. The ‘Blond Angel of Diving’. The legend before the legend. Louganis made his Olympic bow in Montreal in 1976 with Dibiasi - who had dominated the platform in the late 60s and early 70s - aiming for a third straight gold medal on the 10m platform in his fourth and final Games. Could the precociously talented 16-year-old Louganis upset the odds? Sammy Lee his trainer thought he could. However while Louganis could not prevent Dibiasi from claiming a remarkable third gold he left his mark on the master. At the competition’s end Dibiasi told him the future was his.

3 – A STATEMENT PERFORMANCE

Of the 18 medals he would win at international level the silver at the Montreal Games remains the exception - the rest were gold. The first of which was won at the World Championships in Berlin in 1978 when he was just 18. The ‘Nureyev of Diving’ dominated the 10m event under the tutelage of new coach Ron O'Brien who would become a mentor as much as a coach.

4 – FLIRTING WITH DEATH

Louganis was perfection. To watch him dive was to attend a ballet where one marvelled at a unique blend of grace and power. Louganis’ elegance obscured the dangers of the sport. It is a sport that has wreaked serious injury or worse death. During the 80s Sergei Chalibashvili and Nathan Meade died aged 21 while competing and training respectively. And Louganis fell victim to a serious accident too. In 1979 during a United States - USSR meeting in Tbilisi Louganis hit his head on the platform before falling 10 metres to the water below. Louganis was unconscious for 20 minutes.

""If the concrete slab hadn't been covered with soft padding I would have probably died"" he said.

5 – A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CRYSTALLISED FOCUS

In Montreal Dibiasi was convinced of one thing: Louganis would be his successor. In Moscow in 1980 the American would Dibiasi assumed assume his Olympic mantel. Yet geopolitics intervened as Jimmy Carter withdrew the US from the Olympics at protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

Louganis had to wait until 1984 for his Olympic coronation but at the 1982 Worlds in Guayaquil he made a statement and a statement like no one before him. His dominance was such that he could have skipped his last dive and still would have won the 3m competition. His best dive? 92.07. In the 10 metre event he earned a perfect score of 10 from all seven judges – and became the first diver to achieve such a feat at a major international meet.

6 – THE LEGEND AMONG LEGENDS

Journalists have asked me to compare his to other sports. I would say it's like reaching 9.15 meters in the long jump or running the 100 meters in 9.50

Those are the words of Louganis’ coach and mentor O'Brien.

""I don't think it was possible to do better"" he would admit later.

7 – THE LIFE-CHANGING MOMENT

Louganis considered retiring after the Los Angeles Games but O'Brien convinced him to target another double and immortality at Seoul. 1988 would be life-changing but not as Louganis had expected. Six months before the Olympics his partner tested positive for HIV. In March Louganis also returned a HIV positive result. It was a seismic shock that brought his mortality into focus. However a doctor - a doctor who was a relative to be precise - was a source of counsel. The advice in short was to move forward to go to the Games.

8 - THE IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA

Louganis arrived in South Korea facing an impossible dilemma. To reveal his HIV status was perhaps to bring his Olympic dream to an end. In 1988 HIV was a disease with no little stigma - stigma born of misinformation. Yet to remain silent was to bear an immeasurable weight. In 2021 it is common knowledge that the risks of the passing on disease are specific and minute. The same could not be said in the 80s.

However Louganis would triumph again. But first an accident suffered during qualification. An attempt at a double somersault and a half reverse pike saw the defending champion hit his head on the springboard. It was embarrassing but worse was the worry. He was bleeding and “paralyzed with fear” that blood might seep into the water. The wound was sewn up. The worry continued. Only a select few of his inner circle knew of his diagnosis.

However he would win again. As he always did. Louganis secured another double in the South Korean capital the only man in history to sweep the individual diving events in consecutive Olympics.

9 - THE ANNOUNCEMENT

It was not until the 90s that he would open up about his sexuality and HIV status. Secrets can develop into burdens. It was in the early 90s with mentalities changing that Louganis felt the time was right. His pre-recorded appearance at the Gay Games in 1994 was soon followed by the publication of his autobiography Breaking The Surface. The book remained at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for five weeks. It delved into his difficult childhood suicide attempts teenage addiction to drugs and revealed that he had been raped by an ex-partner.

For too long the water seemed to be Louganis’ only refuge.

10 - THE ACTIVIST

Since retirement Louganis wrote his autobiography coached and mentored athletes and found an affinity with dogs - and dog agility shows - but most importantly became a renowned advocate in the fight against discrimination of all kinds.

As one of the first high profile figures to talk openly about having HIV/AIDS Louganis became an advocate for those living with the condition and an example to the world of the full and active role they could play in society. And as one of the first sport stars to come out his activism for LGBTQ rights shines as a beacon to those who followed his example.

He used his lived experience to advocate and fight for those who came after him. A true trailblazer.

Abbott thanks Biden for 'partial approval' of disaster request,"President Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for Texas the White House announced Saturday after a winter storm left much of the state facing power and water shortages in a move Gov. Greg Abbott characterized as only a ""partial"" approval of his request for federal assistance.

Abbott requested the disaster declaration Thursday seeking individual and public assistance for all 254 counties in Texas. Though Biden approved public assistance for all those counties his declaration provides individual assistance for 77 of them according to a press release from Abbott’s office.

Individual assistance is given directly to residents who ""sustained losses due to disasters"" while public assistance can be used to repair or replace public facilities or infrastructure damaged or destroyed by a disaster according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""I thank President Biden for his assistance as we respond to impacts of winter weather across our state. While this partial approval is an important first step Texas will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure all eligible Texans have access to the relief they need"" Abbott said in the release. ""The funds provided under the Major Disaster Declaration may provide crucial assistance to Texans as they begin to repair their homes and address property damage.""

The federal disaster assistance approved by the disaster declaration includes grants for temporary housing home repairs loans to repair property damage caused by the storm and additional programs for individuals and business owners affected by the weather according to a White House press release.

The White House release says the federal aid is available to individuals in 77 Texas counties including Dallas as well as local governments and some nonprofit organizations for ""emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures statewide.""

Biden had said Friday that he planned to declare the situation in Texas a ""major disaster."" The president also said he plans to visit the state next week but he left the date open saying he would go when his presence would not create an additional ""burden.""

""When the president lands in a city in America it has a long tail"" Biden explained.

The federal aid ordered by Biden's disaster declaration is in addition to the supplies the Federal Emergency Management Agency previously sent to Texas after the state experienced widespread power outages due to the storm. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the agency was sending supplies to Texas including power generators diesel fuel water and blankets.

The president said Friday that he directed several federal agencies including Health and Human Services and the departments of Defense and House and Urban Development to ""identity other resources that can provide and address the growing needs of the folk in Texas.""

Dalio who got his start working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange trading commodity futures founded the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates in 1975. With the firm managing about $140 billion in global investments and Dalio’s own net worth coming at $17 billion he has earned legendary status on Wall Street.

Summing up his success Dalio has three pieces of advice for investors. First diversify. Keeping a wide range of stocks in the portfolio from multiple sectors is the surest way to invest well. Second don’t think that rising markets will rise forever. This is Dalio’s variation on an old saw that past performance does not guarantee future returns. Dalio will tell you that all strong past returns really guarantee are current high prices. And finally Dalio tells investors “Do the opposite of what your instincts are.” Or put another way don’t follow the herd as such thinking frequently leads to suboptimal results.

Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform the analyst community believes they do with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings.

Linde PLC (LIN)

The first new position is in Linde the world’s largest industrial gas production company whether counting by revenues or market share. Linde produces a range of gasses for industrial use and is the dominant supplier of argon nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen along with niche gasses like carbon dioxide for the soft drink industry. The company also produces gas storage and transfer equipment welding equipment and refrigerants. In short Linde embodies Dalio’s ‘diversify’ dictum.

Linde’s industry leadership and essential products helped the company bounce back from the corona crisis. The company’s revenues slipped in 1H20 but grew in the second half reaching pre-corona levels in Q3 and exceeding those levels in Q4.

In a sign of confidence the company held its dividend steady through the ‘corona year’ at 96 cents per common share – and in its recent Q1 declaration Linde raised the payment to $1.06 per share. This annualizes to $4.24 and gives a yield of 1.7%. The key point here is not the modest yield but the company’s confidence in the security of its positions allowing it to keep a steady dividend at a time when many peers are cutting profit sharing.

It’s no wonder then that an investor like Dalio would take an interest in a company like Linde. The billionaire’s fund snapped up 20149 shares during the fourth quarter worth $5.05 million at current prices.

Assessing Linde for BMO analyst John McNulty expresses his confidence in Linde’s current performance.

“LIN continues to execute on its growth strategy to drive solid double-digit earnings growth notably without requiring a further macro improvement. In our view management’s 11-13% guide for 2021 remains conservative driven by its on coming projects continued pricing efficiency gains and solid buybacks with its strong balance sheet and cash flows. Further the solid FCF position provides them plenty of dry powder for M&A de-caps etc. We believe LIN is poised to continue to surprise investors and outperform the broader group even in a cyclical market. the largest global industrial gas company” McNulty opined.

In line with his bullish comments McNulty rates LIN as a Buy and his $320 price target implies an upside of ~28% for the coming year. (To watch McNulty’s track record click here)

Wall Street’s analysts are in broad agreement on the quality of Linde’s stock as shown by the 15 Buy reviews overbalancing the 3 Holds. This gives the stock its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Shares are priced at $250.88 and their $295.73 average price target suggests they have ~18% growth ahead. (See LIN stock analysis on TipRanks)

BlackRock (BLK)

Next up is the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock has over $8.67 trillion in assets under management. The company is one of the dominant index funds in the US financial scene and saw $16.2 billion revenue last year with a net income of $4.9 billion.

BlackRock’s recent Q4 report shows its strength as far as numbers can. EPS came in at $10.02 per share a 12% sequential gain and a 20% year-over-year gain. Quarterly revenues of $4.8 billion were up 17% yoy. The full-year top line was up 11% from 2019. BlackRock achieved all of this even as the corona crisis flattened the economy in 1H20.

In the first quarter of this year BlackRock declared its regular quarterly dividend and raised the payment by 13% to $4.13 per common share. At an annualized payment of $16.52 this gives a yield of 2.3%. The company has kept the dividend reliable for the past 12 years.

Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity Dalio’s fund pulled the trigger on 19917 shares giving it a new position in BLK. The value of this new addition? More than $14 million.

Covering BLK for Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell writes “We view 4Q results as very good with strong long-term net inflows across its products which we expect to continue despite a one-time $55bn pension fund outflow of low-fee equity index assets expected in 1H21 which mgmt. said would have a minimal impact on base fee revenue. Additionally total net inflows drove annualized organic base management fee growth of 13% a quarterly record on annualized long-term organic AuM growth of 7%. We expect organic base fee growth to exceed organic AuM growth coming into 2021 driven by a flow mix skewed toward higher fee-rate products for now.”

To this end Bedell rates BLK a Buy and his $837 price target suggests the stock has ~18% upside ahead of it. (To watch Bedell’s track record click here)

The analyst consensus tells a very similar story. BLK has received 6 Buy ratings in the last three months against a single Hold – a clear sign that analysts are impressed with the company’s potential. Shares sell for $710.11 and the average price target of $832.17 gives the stock a 17% upside potential. (See BLK stock analysis on TipRanks)

AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)

AbbVie is a major name in the pharma industry. The company is the maker of Humira an anti-inflammatory used in the treatment of a wide range of chronic illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis Crohn’s disease and psoriasis. The company’s other immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq were approved by the FDA in 2019 as treatments for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis respectively and saw combined sales of $2.3 billion last year. AbbVie expects that these drugs will ‘fill the gap’ in profits when the Humira patents expire in 2023 with up to $15 billion in sales by 2025.

Humira is currently the main driver of AbbVie’s immunology portfolio and provides $19.8 billion of the portfolio’s $22.2 billion in annual revenues and a significant part of the company’s total sales. For the full year 2020 across all divisions AbbVie saw $45.8 billion in revenues with an adjusted diluted EPS of $10.56.

In addition to its high-profile anti-inflammatory line AbbVie also has a ‘stable’ of long-established drugs on the market. As an example the company owns Depakote a common anti-seizure medication. AbbVie also maintains an active research pipeline with scores of drug candidates undergoing studies in the disciplines of immunology neuroscience oncology and virology.

For investors AbbVie has a long-standing commitment to returning profits to shareholders. The company has an 8-year history of keeping a reliable – and growing – dividend. In the most recent declaration made this month for a payment to go out in May AbbVie raised the dividend 10% to $1.30 per common share. At $5.20 annualized this gives a yield of 4.9%.

Once again we are looking at stock that embodies some of Dalio’s advice. Pulling the trigger on ABBV in the fourth quarter Dalio’s firm purchased 25294 shares. At current valuation this is worth $2.66 million.

Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges covers ABBV and is impressed with the way that the company is preparing in advance for the loss of US exclusivity on its best-selling product.

“Between ABBV’s ex-Humira portfolio’s growth trajectory and a broad portfolio of catalysts across early- mid- and late-stage assets it is hard to find a biopharma company that is better positioned even with their looming LOE. ABBV is prepared for 2023 and has growth drivers to drive better than industry average top- and bottom-line growth in the period before (2021-2022) and after (2024-2028) 2023” Porges opined.

Porges gives ABBV an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating and sets a $140 price target that indicates room for a 33% one-year upside. (To watch Porges’ track record click here)

Overall there are 10 reviews on ABBV shares and 9 of those are to Buy – a margin that makes the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. The stock is trading for $105.01 and has an average price target of $122.60. This suggests an upside of ~17% over the next 12 months. (See ABBV stock analysis on TipRanks)

The fees have generated pushback from groups representing businesses such as farms that supply Walmart Canada according to the report. The executives made the remarks quoted by the Financial Post in response to legislative efforts to impose new government controls on such arrangements.

“I’m not for [government controls]” Walmart Canada CEO Horacio Barbeito said the Financial Post reported. “There’s healthy competition in the market. I think the rules are clear. This is common practice in commerce. You have suppliers and retailers in general just thinking about the customer and the ways to serve them.”

He said per the report that there are more digital shoppers because of the pandemic and they cost more to serve.

Walmart Canada’s chief merchandising manager Kieran Shanahan added per the report: “We’re making these big investments. They certainly benefit our supplier partners.”

Representatives of suppliers argue however that Walmart’s ability to impose the fees is proof the current regulatory scheme fails to contemplate Walmart’s market power the report stated.

Food Health and Consumer Products of Canada CEO Michael Graydon said in the report that the fees indicate not “a competitive marketplace” but “a consolidated marketplace where you have the power to be able to do that. The manufacturing community has no choice. If they wish to sell to that particular retailer they’ve got to follow the line.”

In an annual report for fiscal year 2020 Walmart stated that Walmart Canada net sales for the fiscal year fell to $18.42 billion from $18.61 billion in fiscal year 2019. While not breaking down eCommerce sales by country Walmart reported that for all countries outside the U.S. combined they grew to $11.8 billion in 2020 from $6.7 billion in 2019.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 Walmart reported Walmart Canada posted “eCommerce sales growth driven by strength across all categories” and an increase in eCommerce net sales of 229 percent.

Walmart Canada executives had already spoken publicly about the controversy prior to this past week stating it is reasonable for a company spending $3.5 billion over five years on modernization in a country to expect suppliers to help underwrite the cost.

Walmart Canada states in promotional materials that it has 90000 employees working at 400 stores in the country and its eCommerce site walmart.ca is visited by 900000 Canadians per day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhc2VsaW5lbWFnLmNvbS9pdC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L3doeS1zb21lLWVudGVycHJpc2VzLWFyZS1pbnNvdXJjaW5nLXRoZWlyLWl0LWRlcGFydG1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Some Enterprises are Insourcing Their IT Departments,"Ahold Delhaize a major grocery group already had plans in place to overhaul their supply chain and insource more talent before COVID-19 struck. While they could’ve delayed their plans when the pandemic hit the group decided instead to accelerate. They realized that with the pandemic bringing their distribution in-house would allow them to employ more creative solutions to find products their current distributors couldn’t and they were right. Ahold Delhaize was able to get toilet paper from a supplier that usually stocked college campuses and for Thanksgiving they had their top 300 items stocked in the warehouse eight weeks ahead of schedule.

With the havoc to supply chains wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic many U.S.-based enterprises have followed Ahold’s lead and are insourcing and reshoring everything from production and manufacturing to transportation and IT and developer functions. But why make such critical decisions during a time of unprecedented uncertainty? Uncertainty is exactly the reason – corporations realized that the way they had been doing business had previously unimagined risks.

IT teams have been part of that trend. Insourcing IT helps enterprises better align their procedures with company goals provides greater security control can insure against unplanned disruptions and can even save money on some hidden costs associated with outsourcing. What’s more enterprises need that talent close at hand as they overhaul their supply chain management and other corporate systems. Let’s take a deeper look at why some enterprises are choosing to insource their IT departments.

Jump ahead to:

Better business alignment and integration

When organizations insource their IT and dev departments they gain better control over processes to align them with their business goals. Not only did Ahold Delhaize begin insourcing their distribution but they also hired an entire team of specialists to oversee the transition. Your in-house team will have a deeper understanding of the company and you’ll have more control over the quality of the project since you can oversee the work at any stage. Additionally communication is easier because the IT department is connected to all of the other departments in your organization.

With an in-house IT department the employees you have are specially trained to meet your business needs while outsourced IT staff might only cover more general roles. They can also offer more hands-on service for both your application and hardware needs. With outsourced professionals you may also run into communications delays and other challenges that are less likely with insourced teams.

Greater security control

Insourcing your IT department also gives you greater control over your network security. With in-house IT and dev teams it’s easier to know exactly who should be logging onto your network. If everyone is working in the office you can also keep all important data on-premises rather than having critical things like privileged accounts and source code in far-flung places. However even with remote employees a VPN could offer similar security features – and a “zero trust” approach would be even better with access limited by role and device.

Along with better protection against hacks insourcing provides greater control over your intellectual property. While there’s always some risk of intellectual property leaking it’s smaller with insourced teams.

Improving time to market

If you need to improve your speed to market insourcing is the way to go. With in-house staff you can identify bottlenecks and discover issues more quickly. It’s easier to get a hold of your employees when you need them. Additionally when you know your team better you can assign tasks to the people best suited for them increasing efficiency.

You also need to consider the global disruption caused by the pandemic especially in the supply chain industry. Moving things closer to home can help you reduce risk. Outsourced IT departments can cause delays especially if they act as a middleman between your corporate office and your supply chain. Even small delays can add up through the process greatly reducing your speed to market.

The hidden costs of outsourcing

Outsourcing also has some hidden costs associated with it that you can avoid by insourcing. In software development for example even small alterations are usually accompanied by a change order fee. With insourced IT those changes won’t cost you extra. Outsourcing can also create project delays something that’s never been more critical to avoid.

Additionally when outsourcing IT you lose some control over the project. While your organization and the IT company will have agreed on the project and criteria someone has to hold them accountable for what you agreed on and paid for. IT outsourcing contracts typically lose value between initiation and project completion.

Employee disengagement is also a problem with outsourcing for both internal and external IT staff. Internal IT staff may be frustrated when they have to hand off a project they’ve taken ownership of and they may seek other employment opportunities and be costly to replace. Similarly external IT teams may not have the same buy-in for the project that internal stakeholders would potentially leading to an inferior product.

Switching to insourced talent

Insourcing IT and dev functions creates synergies with hiring procedures. To insource talent for your IT project you first need to determine specifics and figure out what kind of specialists you’ll need. You’ll also want to choose people who are passionate about what your company offers. Insourced talent provides a level of buy-in that’s really difficult to find with outsourced options and it can increase the quality of your projects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc2luZm90ZWNoLmNvbS90b3AtYWktbGFicy1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top AI Labs in India,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a smart-algorithm process which copies bits of human intelligence building it into a dynamic computing environment.

While Adobe Flash Player has reached the end of life and is no longer supported by any browsers many people may not realize this and click on the 'Update' button thinking they are installing the latest update.

If a user clicks on the Update button they will download a setup.msi file [VirusTotal] that installs a potentially unwanted program called 'One Updater.'

Photo editors have also been around for quite a while now. Thanks to the smartphone revolution (they are a revolution aren’t they?) photo editors have reached a point in which we might consider switching to them. Modern photo editor apps have proven it to be highly effective and worthy. So in this article we have listed some of the best photo editing apps for iPhone and Android.



Here are our top-picked photo editors that are available for the iPhone and Android.

List of Photo Editing Apps

Snapseed

Who else to start with other than Google’s own. Snapseed is a photo editor owned and developed by Google. And if we know anything about Google they’re the best when it comes to photos. There is no doubt that Google has the advantage of having a wide userbase than anyone else in this list which clearly does pay off in the end for Google.

Snapseed comes with all the essential tools required for photo editing like cropping vignettes straightening frames text etc. The app also offers customizable filters which is a great addition. Powered by Google’s AI Snapseed does a great job at making your photos look beautiful. Above all Snapseed is free and available for both iPhone and Android. You can download it from the following links.

Snapseed: Google Play | App Store

Prisma Photo Editor

Prisma won’t be needing an introduction (does it?). It came in a time when most filters made our photos looked like “drawings” or “paintings” (and to be honest all of them were truly horrible weren’t they?). There is no denying that Prisma did a great job at converting our images into paintings that looked like Picasso came into our homes.

You could get away with the generous amount of free filters we would recommend that you try the premium version. Don’t worry it won’t put a hole in your pocket. Prisma also happens to have its own community like Instagram/Facebook so yeah your skills won’t go unnoticed. You can download it from the following links.

Prisma: Google Play | App Store

Adobe Photoshop Express

Here comes the “professional” photo editor from a company that supposedly holds a monopoly in the PC realm. The so-called mobile version of Photoshop lets the user play with advanced (or just the basic) features like exposure contrast colour correction and much more.

As said above Adobe Photoshop Express is an excellent tool for tweaking your images. With a decent selection of filters overlay textures and tools for making collages we’d say the app is worth the penny. You can download it from the following links.

VSCO

VSCO is all about the filters. These make your photos look like they were taken with an analogue film camera. Yeah the basic version is more than enough for you but you could definitely try their 7-day free trial. The vast range of presets includes those designed to emulate classic rolls of film from Kodak Fujifilm and Ilford.

The user can also use VSCO to adjust the exposure temperature contrast or skin tones. They can also share their handwork with VSCO’s community or to another social media platform. You can download it from the following links.

VSCO: Google Play | App Store

Adobe Lightroom

Well here is another one from Adobe. Lightroom for mobile is very much similar to that of the PC variant. The app has the same set of tools you’d find in Lightroom on the desktop. And yes it is not meant for adding stickers onto a photo (maybe you could work around a little).

The projects sync in the cloud letting a user continue on their beefy machine if they do so require. Yeah it’s paid but for the reason that it does what it claims. You can download it from the following links.

Adobe Lightroom: Google Play | App Store

Foodie

This one is special as the name suggests is meant for all the foodies out there. A true foodie doesn’t care what others think of their eating habits and neither does Foodie. Foodie’s editor is very much similar to that of Instagram’s. But here all of the 30 filters and editing features are set up with food in mind. You can download it from the following links.

Foodie: Google Play | App Store

Visage

This one on the other hand is meant for minor details. We believe there’s nothing wrong with pimples dark spots bags under the eyes or teeth that aren’t perfectly white. But what if you don’t want them in your selfies (you know just to confirm how bad you’d look without them). The free version of the app lets the user quickly retouch their portrait photos. one can smooth skin reduce skin shine apply eye makeup whiten teeth and more.

However the free version of the app is filled with ads. And comes with a pimple that looks just like a watermark. So we recommend that you go with the pro version. You can download it from the following links.

In spite of all the progress made in Black representation in America these advances have yet to translate to the C-suite in corporate America. With the resignation of Tapestry CEO Jide Zeitlin in July 2020 the number of Black CEOs among the Fortune 500 dropped to a woeful four. One person will soon be added to that list as Rosalind Brewer Starbucks’ chief operating officer will take over as the CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance. She will be leaving Starbucks at the end of February and will then be the only Black woman CEO at a Fortune 500 company. Unfortunately this list will shrink again when Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier retires in June 2021.

Over the complete history of the Fortune 500 which dates back to 1999 there have only been a total of 18 Black CEOs leading America’s Fortune 500 companies. The peak year for representation was 2012 when a still-anemic total of six Black CEOs led corporate America’s most prominent companies. As Black History Month unfolds it’s a good time to take a closer look at the four Black CEOs paving the way for future leaders of color.

Kenneth Frazier: Merck

Kenneth Frazier has been the CEO of pharmaceutical company Merck since January 2011 but he’ll be reducing the headcount of Black CEOs in America by one when he retires in June 2021.

Frazier’s storied history includes his pre-Merck career as an attorney when he helped free a Black death row inmate who had been falsely accused of murder. He continued his activism even while helming one of the largest companies in the world calling for other leaders to create new opportunities and jobs to help solve the racial inequalities in America. Frazier resigned from former President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council after his comments regarding white nationalist groups in Charlottesville Virginia in 2017.

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

When they're not enjoying Park City guests can take advantage of the home's TV BluRay player movie collection and Chromecast to stream entertainment as well as play various board games or work remotely over the home's Wi-Fi. There are even yoga mats and a foam roller if guests want to get in a little exercise. The tree house is close to the host's chalet and guests may also encounter their pets: two miniature Australian shepherds and two outdoor cats.

The stairs to the tree house are fairly easy to climb but the host notes that guests will need a car with four-wheel drive in order to travel along the three miles of dirt or snow-packed roads that lead to the property.

Naturally this home is booked solid until May (at the time this article was written). But nightly rates begin at only $263.

Studies have shown that remote working is allowing employees to be more engaged productive and happier because it cuts down the stress of commuting and frees up time that can be spent with family or on hobbies. But working remotely also comes with its own set of distractions if you share your home and that is where Nooka steps in – an Irish startup that lets you rent out ting office sheds for your backyard!

Nooka calls these sheds ‘proximity office space’ that people can lease or re-rent Airbnb-style to others. Believe it or not Nooka was developing the concept pre-pandemic after noticing that people who used coworking spaces ended up spending a lot of time working from home in less-than-ideal conditions to avoid commuting or upgrading their coworking space plans. “Even before COVID hit we saw that a lot of people were working from home and most of the time they’re just working from their kitchen table their sofa sometimes their bed. The work-from-home experience hasn’t really shifted at all. Nobody’s really innovated on that” says Leanne Beesley CEO of Nooka.

You can buy backyard offices but they are really expensive for even the most basic models so Nooka decided to fill this gap in the market by going for a membership model that takes the best of WeWork Airbnb and office pods – the smallest office rents for €299 a month and the two-person size for €399. It can be easily installed in your backyard and comes fully equipped with a desk chair closet high-speed WiFi power lighting a smart lock heating and cooling. The team is working on versions that also come with a bathroom. They can be rented out for a few hours or for a few weeks if you are traveling. Nooka also wanted to offer the option for anyone with a backyard to rent the space to neighbors who might not have yards of their own and all of this can be managed through their app.

These office sheds can also be shared by communities for remote working and remote learning even after the pandemic. It allows for people to keep living in areas that aren’t full of offices and offset a trend of people moving to cities because they don’t see opportunities in smaller towns. Working from home and having a flexible lifestyle can improve the quality of life and encourage a lower carbon footprint. You can choose to stay close to home share the amenities with the community to reduce costs and even open up a network for expats or frequent business trip flyers where they can have an office pod to work from!

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Allegion's current trading price of US$109 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Allegion’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

View our latest analysis for Allegion

What's the opportunity in Allegion?

Allegion is currently expensive based on my price multiple model where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Allegion’s ratio of 32.03x is above its peer average of 22.17x which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Building industry. But is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Allegion’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for share price volatility.

What does the future of Allegion look like?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Allegion's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 66% indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? ALLE’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ALLE should trade below its current price selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ALLE for some time now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ALLE which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

If you'd like to know more about Allegion as a business it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. You'd be interested to know that we found 2 warning signs for Allegion and you'll want to know about these.

The 59-acre project – located at the southwest corner of the Loop 202 and 40th Street – will comprise five buildings. Four buildings will be developed speculatively in a joint venture between TCC and Allstate Insurance Company. The fifth building will be the new corporate headquarters and distribution center for hometown appliance giant Spencer’s TV & Appliance. TCC has been retained by Spencer’s to manage the development of that project.

“The Loop 202 freeway extension already has proven to be a game-changer for businesses that require easy access to the East and West Valley without having to cut through downtown Phoenix” said Cathy Thuringer Managing Director of TCC’s Phoenix office. “Akimel Gateway sited adjacent to the full diamond interchange at 40th Street will leverage its strategic location prime freeway visibility leading-edge design and high-quality construction like no other project in the Valley. We’re thrilled to welcome Spencer’s to Akimel Gateway and we look forward to more high-profile names joining us here in the future.”

Rick Biederbeck President of employee-owned Spencer’s TV & Appliance said the company will use the commerce park as a distribution point and corporate headquarters to service Spencer’s 10 retail locations located throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area.

“The Valley has grown up with Spencer’s during the nearly 50 years we’ve been in the appliance business” said Biederbeck. “When you’re serving customers to the east in Mesa and Gilbert and to the west in Glendale Goodyear and Arrowhead a site that provides access to the greater Phoenix metro area is a must.”

Thuringer says the commerce park’s name reflects the degree to which TCC intends to continue to work with the GRIC and its leadership and to honor the Community’s centuries-old culture. “Akimel” is an O’otham word that means “river.” The project name was chosen after consultation with members of the Community.

Gila River Indian Community Governor Stephen Roe Lewis pointed to the project as an example of the significant economic expansion gaining momentum in the area near Wild Horse Pass south of Ahwatukee.

“The South Mountain Loop 202 corridor continues to attract enormous interest in multiple contexts” said Gov. Lewis. “Trammell Crow’s Akimel Gateway project is an exciting development along with the recently announced 3300-acre master plan development of Wild Horse Pass the Community’s ongoing casino and hotel expansion and the new soccer stadium being built to accommodate the Phoenix Rising Football Club. I can’t think of a more dynamic spot in the Valley right now – or a better location for business.”

TCC’s capital partners for the project include investor Allstate Investments and lender Alliance Bank of Arizona. Carrie DeWees Managing Principal at Allstate Investments said speculative development at Akimel Gateway is “the right project at the right time” given present market conditions.

“With Spencer’s as an early adopter we expect Akimel Gateway to be extremely well received by the marketplace. The demand for Class A space continues to run high and this prime location can only add value to the project” said DeWees. “There is just nothing else like this in what promises to be an explosive growth corridor in metropolitan Phoenix.”

The four speculative buildings together will measure 519000 square feet. Depending upon configuration the buildings will feature a combination of ramp-up and dock-high loading with clear heights ranging from 28 to 32 feet making them especially suitable as sites for light manufacturers electrical mechanical HVAC plumbing and lighting suppliers as well as e-commerce centers.

TCC and Allstate Investments are proud that Akimel Gateway is a female-led effort by both partners in the joint venture. Butler Design Group is serving as the project architect HILGARTWILSON is the civil engineer and Wespac Construction is the general contractor. Senior Vice Presidents John Werstler Cooper Fratt and Mike Parker with CBRE are responsible for the leasing and marketing of the project. Construction is scheduled for completion by December 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

BIDEN’S COVID-19 RELIEF PROPOSAL INCLUDES $130B FOR SCHOOLS EVEN AS BILLIONS IN AID GO UNSPENT

The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

PARLER INTERIM CEO SAYS TRUMP BIDEN WELCOME ON PLATFORM

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

GOOGLE TO EVALUATE EXECUTIVES ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Mr. Biden has signaled that he supports rescinding the broad legal immunity that tech firms currently enjoy for information carried over their networks.

As the Biden administration settles in tech companies are awaiting key picks for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division head. The appointments could determine how aggressively the government handles existing investigations or bringing about new ones advisers to the companies said.

The Journal's analysis is based on the latest Federal Election Commission data covering the 2020 election cycle for Mr. Biden's campaign two joint fundraising committees and individual donations to those committees made through the online donation platform ActBlue. The Journal examined campaign-finance data to compile a list of companies whose employees donated the most money.

The analysis relied on a standardized version of the self-reported employer information on each donation and should be treated as an estimate because some of the public records are incomplete or flawed.

Because online donation platforms that itemize even the smallest contribution weren't as widely used in 2016 and 2012 data for previous years include information only on donors who gave more than $200 to a campaign.

About two-thirds of the money in presidential races is donated to candidates from individuals who could give up to $2800 to a candidate for the recent election. Those who donate $200 or more are required to disclose the names of their employers.

While corporations are prohibited from making financial donations to candidates for national office many companies operate political-action committees or PACs which are employee-funded accounts that companies use to donate money to favored candidates. Relatively little money in presidential elections comes from corporate PACs. Labor unions spend millions of dollars each election to support Democratic candidates.

Technology employees made donations to other political entities that worked to elect Mr. Biden and other Democrats including Future Forward USA PAC which spent millions of dollars on the 2020 election.

Mr. Biden's campaign according to the Journal's analysis received $3.7 million from employees of five of the largest Wall Street firms: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. Bank of America Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. In prior elections those firms ranked among the top sources of money for the Democratic presidential candidate records show.

That was less than the total contributed to Mr. Biden by employees of Alphabet who donated $5.3 million making the tech company the No. 1 source of money the Journal analysis shows.

Google employees were the top source of donations to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign and the second-largest source of money for Mr. Obama's 2012 race.

Employees of Amazon contributed a total of $2.8 million to Mr. Biden's campaign. Amazon was the third-largest source of money among companies to Mr. Biden in the election. The company hadn't been a big source of campaign money for prior Democratic candidates records show.

Microsoft employees have long been a top source of money for Democratic presidential candidates. Microsoft employees donated $3.2 million to Mr. Biden in the election.

Facebook employees have emerged as a top source of money donating $1.9 million to his campaign records show.

Other top sources of money for Mr. Biden were employees of Lowercase Capital Oracle Corp. Netflix Inc. Saban Capital Group and Morgan & Morgan the data analyzed by the Journal shows. Lowercase Capital is a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in Twitter Uber Technologies Inc. and Instagram now part of Facebook.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content a senior lawmaker said on Monday as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law.

Australia and the tech giants have been in a stand-off over the legislation widely seen as setting a global precedent.

Other countries including Canada and Britain have already expressed interest in taking some sort of similar action.

Facebook has protested the laws. Last week it blocked all news content and several state government and emergency department accounts in a jolt to the global news industry which has already seen its business model upended by the titans of the technological revolution.

Talks between Australia and Facebook over the weekend yielded no breakthrough.

As Australia's senate began debating the legislation the country's most senior lawmaker in the upper house said there would be no further amendments.

""The bill as it stands ... meets the right balance"" Simon Birmingham Australia's Minister for Finance told Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio.

The bill in its present form ensures ""Australian-generated news content by Australian-generated news organisations can and should be paid for and done so in a fair and legitimate way"".

The laws would give the government the right to appoint an arbitrator to set content licencing fees if private negotiations fail.

While both Google and Facebook have campaigned against the laws Google last week inked deals with top Australian outlets including a global deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

""There's no reason Facebook can't do and achieve what Google already has"" Birmingham added.

A Facebook representative declined to comment on Monday on the legislation which passed the lower house last week and has majority support in the Senate.

A final vote after the so-called third reading of the bill is expected on Tuesday.

Lobby group DIGI which represents Facebook Google and other online platforms like Twitter Inc meanwhile said on Monday that its members had agreed to adopt an industry-wide code of practice to reduce the spread of misinformation online.

Under the voluntary code they commit to identifying and stopping unidentified accounts or ""bots"" disseminating content; informing users of the origins of content; and publishing an annual transparency report among other measures.

Facebook Inc is back at the negotiating table Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday after the tech giant this week blocked news on its site in the country.

Facebook’s abrupt decision to stop Australians from sharing news on the site and strip the pages of domestic and foreign news outlets also erased several state government and emergency department accounts causing widespread anger.

The company has “tentatively friended us again” Morrison told a news conference in Sydney.

“What I’m pleased about is that Facebook is back at the table again.”

Facebook has publicly indicated no change in its opposition to a proposed law requiring social media platforms to pay for links to news content. Morrison was not asked about that.

Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday he had spoken with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and further talks were expected over the weekend. It was not clear whether those talks have happened.

A Facebook spokeswoman and representatives for Frydenberg did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Standoff with Zuckerberg

The standoff comes as Australia promises to press ahead with the landmark legislation which could set a global precedent as countries like Canada express interest in taking similar action.

The Australian law which would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google to reach commercial deals with Australian publishers or face compulsory arbitration has cleared the lower house of Parliament and is expected to be passed by the Senate within the next week.

Simon Milner Facebook’s director of policy for the Asia-Pacific region was quoted on Saturday as telling the Sydney Morning Herald the company had three main objections to the legislation.

Facebook objects to being barred from discriminating between different news outlets that ask for money to arbitration models that allow an independent body to select one payment over another and to the obligation to enter commercial negotiations with Australian media companies Milner said.

Facebook declined to make Milner available to speak with the Reuters news agency.

Australia’s legislation is being widely watched overseas.

Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said on Thursday his country would adopt the Australian approach as it crafts its own legislation in the coming months.

Google which had initially threatened to close its search engine in Australia has announced a host of preemptive licensing deals over the past week including a global agreement with News Corp.

Facebook’s move had an immediate impact on traffic to Australian news sites according to early data from the New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat.

Google said in a statement Mitchell violated the company's code of conduct and security policies by moving electronic files outside the company. Mitchell who announced her firing on Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.



Google's ethics in artificial intelligence work has been under scrutiny since the firing of Gebru a scientist who gained prominence for exposing bias in facial analysis systems. The dismissal prompted thousands of Google workers to protest. She and Mitchell had called for greater diversity and inclusion among Google's research staff and expressed concern that the company was starting to censor papers critical of its products.



Gebru said Google fired her after she questioned an order not to publish a study saying AI that mimics language could hurt marginalized populations. Mitchell a co-author of the paper publicly criticized the company for firing Gebru and undermining the credibility of her work."

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

PARLER INTERIM CEO SAYS TRUMP BIDEN WELCOME ON PLATFORM

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

According to an analysis of satellite data from NASA’s Amazon dashboard the 2020 fire season was actually more severe by some key measures.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites can detect thermal anomalies or hot spots caused by fires. In 2020 both VIIRS sensors combined detected about 1.4 million anomalies in the southern Amazon compared to 1.1 million in 2019.

“Fire activity was up significantly in 2020. All types of fires contributed to the increase including deforestation fires and understory fires the most environmentally destructive types” said Douglas Morton chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “In the southern Brazilian Amazon deforestation fire activity increased by 23 percent from 2019 to 2020 and active fire detections from understory fires were 60 percent higher than in 2019.”

Morton and colleagues have developed a new tool that groups and sorts fires into four types: deforestation (red in the map at the top of the page) understory forest fire (green) savanna-grassland (blue) and small clearing-agricultural (purple). Download a full-resolution view of the map here. The tool uses characteristics like the duration intensity and movement of fire anomalies to group and identify individual fire events. A single fire event can include dozens or even hundreds of connected thermal anomalies spread out over days or weeks.

As shown in the series of images above deforestation fires are part of a multi-step process that converts tropical rainforests for ranching and farming. It begins months and often years beforehand when patches of forest are razed by bulldozers and tractors. The wood is then pushed into piles left to dry and then torched during the dry season. Multiple fires are needed to completely clear the land for agriculture.

In 2020 deforestation fires were concentrated in rural areas in Brazil along transportation corridors in the rainforest primarily in the states of Pará Amazonas and Rondônia. Deforestation fires also burned in other Amazon countries but on a smaller scale. In the map above dark gray depicts the location of forests. Light gray areas lack forests—either because of deforestation or because savanna or grassland vegetation grows naturally there.

Small-clearing fires are typically set within forests by subsistence farmers within forests. They were widespread along rivers in several South American countries but the environmental impacts are modest. Understory fires occur when other fire types escape and burn through leaf litter and woody debris on the floor of rainforests. Savanna fires burned widely in areas with thinner shrubbier woodlands and grasslands such as the cerrado of eastern Brazil and the Moxos plains of northern Bolivia. While savanna vegetation grows back quickly after fires deforestation and understory forest fires cause damage that can persist for decades.

For much of 2020 warm ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic (and a record hurricane season) shifted rainfall away from South America producing warm and dry conditions in the dry forests and savannas of the southeastern Amazon. “As a result the scale of the fires in this area was extraordinary and devastating” said Morton. “We tracked nearly 600000 individual fire events in the southern Amazon and surrounding biomes including 25 fires that were larger than 500 square kilometers (190 square miles) in Bolivia Brazil and Paraguay putting them on par with the size of the largest fires in California in 2020.”

Many of the largest fires occurred in the Pantanal—a floodplain along the border of Brazil Paraguay and Bolivia where grasslands become susceptible to fire during the dry season. Fires also raged through dry forests in the neighboring Gran Chaco region. According to data from NASA’s Amazon dashboard fires charred 43000 square kilometers (17000 square miles) of the Pantanal region in 2020—about 28 percent of the Pantanal. In the map above fires in the region were classified as either understory forest or savanna fires based on the density of tree cover.

In the Brazilian state of Pará where deforestation fires were more common indigenous territories and other protected areas had notably different levels of fire activity. Baú and Menkragnoti lands are patrolled by indigenous groups that actively resist land development from outsiders. As seen in the map below they saw few fires. In contrast Apyterewa territory had large numbers of fires including many deforestation around its southern border. Limited enforcement of land-use rules and the proximity to São Felix de Xingu a cattle town with more than 2 million animals have made Apyterewa lands appealing to grilheiros or “land grabbers” explained University of Toronto researcher Gabriel de Oliveira.

Emissions from fires on Apyterewa lands have been rising rapidly since 2017 according to one analysis by de Oliveira and colleagues. “We know this increase is not related to how indigenous people use fire” he said. “The Parakanã in that territory—only about 700 people—have used small-scale fires to manage the land for decades. The huge increases in fire emissions only came after exponential increases in deforestation and commercial livestock expansion by outsiders.”

Some organizations working in the region hope that infusions of new satellite data and analyses could change the dynamic. For instance SERVIR-Amazonia a USAID/NASA initiative is currently working with the Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) to develop a data portal for users in Pará and hosted by the state’s Secretariat of Environment and Sustainability. “Our goal is to customize the NASA Amazon dashboard to make the data as useful as possible for local decision makers who are trying to combat fires and deforestation” said Jose Leandro R. Fernandes an engagement lead with SERVIR-Amazonia.

The impacts of NGOs and other organizations working at the local level can be considerable. “You can clearly see the impact of philanthropy in the 2020 fire data” said Barbara Zimmerman director of the The Kayapó Project for the International Conservation Fund of Canada. “Forest remains intact throughout most of Kayapó territory that receives outside conservation and development support. But over one million hectares of Kayapó territory along the mid to southeastern border—areas not allied with environmental groups—is undergoing rampant illegal invasion by gold mining and logging.”

In the map and Landsat image above note that the largest fires in Kayapó territory burned in natural grassy savanna. Even the large fires classified as understory forest fires in this territory occurred in woodland savannas—areas with scattered trees growing amidst more fire-prone grasslands. Kayapó people use fire in these areas for hunting small-scale clearing and for horticulture plots. Some fires may have been started for these purposes but then spread de Oliveira noted. The forests in the eastern part of Kayapó territory are more prone to burning because logging and mining has opened up and dried out the canopy making it more flammable Zimmerman said.

The Amazon dashboard team at NASA hopes that by making data publicly available in near-real time government agencies NGOs firefighting and law enforcement organizations and academic researchers will be able to use it to respond more effectively to fires. “Our system identified about 23000 individual deforestation fire events in 2020 but realistically fire brigades can only respond to about 1 percent of them” said Morton. “With day-to-day tracking from tools like this we think it will be easier for organizations to make the hard choices about which fires they will spend resources on to try to stop.”

That’s one of the insights gleaned from a close read of Amazon’s new Form 10-K the annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which public companies offer unvarnished updates on their business results and operations.

Amazon’s 10-K filed Feb. 3 includes the most significant changes in more than two decades in the way the company refers to its employees. In fact the section on employees isn’t titled “Employees” anymore. Instead it’s “Human Capital.”

There’s an entirely new paragraph on diversity safety and employee development.

And for purposes of regulatory disclosure at least the company is no longer saying this: “We consider our employee relations to be good.” Variations of that sentence have been a fixture of Amazon’s 10-K from the company’s 1997 IPO through last year’s filing. It no longer appears in any form in the latest version.

The timing is notable in several ways.

10-K changes: Against that backdrop here are the changes in the 10-K section on employees compared with the 10-K for the prior year (which previously hadn’t changed much dating back to the late 1990s). New additions are in bold; removed language is in strike-through; normal text remains the same from the prior year.

Employees Human Capital Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31 2019 2020 we employed approximately 798000 1298000 full-time and part-time employees. However employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business . Additionally we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils statutory employee representation obligations and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff. We focus on investment and innovation inclusion and diversity safety and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development including industry-leading pay and benefits skills training programs such as Amazon Career Choice and the Amazon Technical Academy mentorship and support resources and programs that advance engagement communication and feedback.

Notes on language: “Human Capital” might sound dystopian as a direct replacement for “employees” but it’s an accepted term in finance meant to reflect a more comprehensive view of the value of employees.

“The concept of human capital recognizes that not all labor is equal” explains the official Investopedia entry on the term. “But employers can improve the quality of that capital by investing in employees—the education experience and abilities of employees all have economic value for employers and for the economy as a whole.”

Amazon has also renamed its Human Resources division led by senior vice president Beth Galetti as “People Experience and Technology.” (We learned this in reporting on the recent departure of the company’s diversity and inclusion leader Elizabeth Nieto for a new role at Spotify.)

Language removed from the employee section of Amazon’s 10-K includes past references to unions in Amazon’s international and studio operations. (The section makes no reference to unions anymore which is notable given the ongoing union vote at the company’s Alabama warehouse.) Elsewhere in the filing the company still lists international labor unions and the potential for disruptions from labor disputes among the risk factors to its business.

Worker safety: The 10-K notes that the company has added more than 400000 workers since February 2020 to increase its fulfillment center capacity largely in response to skyrocketing demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. That growth has put an increased focus on worker safety in its fulfillment and distribution centers.

The New York Times Magazine explores the issue this week in the piece “Amazon’s Great Labor Awakening.” Writer Erika Hayasaki tells the stories of Amazon workers and observes “[W]hile Amazon has often acknowledged that workers have the right to unionize the company has tried to persuade them that doing so would introduce an unnecessary middleman. But Covid-19 proved to be a breaking point. Some workers were no longer willing to make concessions to a company that they felt was jeopardizing their safety and potentially their lives.”

Amazon’s 10-K says that the company spent more than $11.5 billion on COVID-19 related costs in 2020 including extensive safety measures.

“We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety” the filing says “and comply with evolving federal state and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers and communities.”

In violation of Amazon’s social distancing policy Amazon has forced workers to attend anti-union meetings and sent workers constant text messages daily hinting that a union could possibly lead to the warehouse closing. Amazon has even gotten the local authorities to shorten the time of stoplights outside of the plant so that union organizers can’t hand out pro-union literature to workers passing in their cars.

Now Amazon is doing something that labor observers have never seen before in a union election; they are offering $2000 “resignation bonuses” to quit.

Last night workers throughout the plant received emails offering them bonuses if they simply quit their jobs. The emails offer workers who worked for 2 peak seasons at least $2000 to quit. If workers have been there at least 3 peak seasons they are offering them $3000.

Some Amazon workers who dislike their job at the warehouse may find the bonuses a tempting bridge to quit their job and seek something better. Workers are even being told that if they quit now that they could regain their jobs later after the union election.

However if workers quit now they won’t be eligible to vote in the ongoing union election. In the meantime many labor observers expect that Amazon will seek to hire replacements that will vote solidly anti-union.

“That should be illegal how can you pay someone to resign” says 48-year-old Black Amazon worker Jennifer Bates “They are going all the way they are pulling out all the stops”.

Under federal labor law the bonuses could be considered a bribe and could lead to the union election being thrown out. Employers are strictly forbidden from improving the material conditions of workers in the lead up to elections and the “resignation bonuses” could be grounds for the union to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to order a new union election if RWDSU loses this round.

“The NLRB routinely finds violations for ‘conferring benefits’ to induce employees not to vote for a union during the “critical period” between the time the election petition is filed and the election is held” says University of Wyoming Labor Law Professor Mike Duff a former prosecutor for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

However the bonuses could backfire on Amazon. Some union supporters have used the offer of the bonuses to argue that Amazon could easily afford to pay workers more if the company desired to.

“If you know that they need it why don’t you give it to them anyway as a bonus” adds Bates.

Union organizers are nervous but despite the intimidation and anti-union tactics they aren’t deterred in their fight to unionize.

“I think there is this wall in front of me right now. And it’s because I can’t see what’s on the other side” says Bates of the union election set to end on March 30th. “And I think a lot of times in life that’s when you really have to take a step. Because just because you don’t see what’s on the other side doesn’t mean that’s not victory”.

Clarification: Amazon periodically gives out “resignation bonuses” when trying to reduce their workforce following a peak season but had never given out such bonuses in Alabama prior to the union election; leading many to view the bonuses as suspicious.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9yb2t1LXZzLWFtYXpvbi1maXJlLXR2LXN0aWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick: Which is best for you?,"Picking a new streaming device often brings you to debate Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick. And while Amazon is eager to discount its Firesticks price is not the only factor to take into consideration when you make your purchase.

While Roku and Fire TV both have a ton of apps there are some notable differences between the two platforms. Which one is the best streaming device for your household will depend on a few different decisions

After reading our in-depth Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick faceoff you'll have a pretty good idea about which family of streaming devices you should buy into.

Here's everything you need to know to decide between Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV.

Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick: Streaming devices

Both Fire TV Sticks and Roku devices start at $29. For that money you get the Roku Express or the Fire TV Stick Lite  and each has its own set of drawbacks and perks. The Fire TV Stick Lite's comparative win comes with its Alexa-enabled remote but its excessive promotion of Prime Video may rub people the wrong way. As for the Roku Express it's got fairly snappy performance for its price but its remote signal quality isn't perfect and required some extra intent in our testing.

Going slightly more expensive you see that Roku has Amazon beat when it comes to UHD streaming. Amazon's $40 Fire TV Stick maxes out at 1080p while the cheaper $35 Roku Premiere streams in 4K. While the Premiere has the same remote issue as the Express it's still a better buy than the normal Fire TV Stick.

All of Amazon's Fire Sticks just hide behind your TV and that's a great design feature — they exist without reminding you that they're there. Your experience with the Roku Express and Premiere might not be as effortless as they're so light that they may have a hard time sitting on a surface evenly.

Those who can spend $50 will get the best streaming device either company makes: the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and the Roku Streaming Stick Plus (the best streaming device in our book). Both stream in beautiful 4K HDR and offer speedy navigation and voice-enabled remote controls and hide behind your TV like all of Amazon's Firesticks.

So to help us decide this close fight we took an average of the ratings we gave the Roku and Fire TV devices. Roku's Streaming Stick Plus (4.5 stars) Premiere and Express (3.5 stars each) averaged out to 3.8 stars beating the 3.3-star average from Amazon's 3 Firesticks: Fire TV Stick Lite and Fire TV Stick (3 stars each) and Fire TV Stick 4K (4 stars).

Winner: Roku

Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick: Home screen and interface

The Roku is the out and out winner when it comes to streaming device home screens. Folks who like their Fire Stick may find it as a convenient way to watch a lot of video from Amazon — the home screen promotes a lot of Prime Video and Amazon Channels content — but it lacks in customization.

Roku Streaming Stick Plus (Image credit: Roku)

This is a problem for anyone who bought their Fire TV Stick because of its affordability but discovers they don't want to watch what Prime Video is offering. Because now you're getting a face full of Prime Video content.

Amazon has rolled out a slightly updated interface to its non-4K Firesticks but it's not enough to change our mind. Sure the interface looks slightly prettier but it's still heavy on Amazon content and light on the ability to customize and control what you see.

Roku TV (Image credit: TCL)

Roku has a much cleaner and simpler home screen: a grid of icons that you can rearrange and a list of menu options. This is all we really need and it allows you to see more apps at once than you would on the Fire TV where you scroll through a carousel.

Winner: Roku

Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick: Apps and channels

Amazon Fire Sticks and Roku devices can access a lot of content. 42Matters claims that Fire TV has 11101 apps but Roku has 21011 apps . But most people don't need that many apps much less a small fraction of those large amounts. The story of apps on streaming devices is more about what's missing.

Amazon Fire TV Stick (Image credit: Amazon)

Long-time streaming device owners have often spent some time dealing with the lack of a new streaming service here and there. This is often because it takes time for companies to iron out contracts as we the consumers lose. For example YouTube TV took a lot longer to land on Fire TV than other platforms — finally arriving in 2019.

2020 saw both Peacock and HBO Max launch and both took their sweet time to land on Roku. And while HBO Max made it to Fire TV Sticks Peacock is still not on Fire TV. The Walmart-owned movie streaming service Vudu is not on Fire TV either.

TCL 32S327 Roku TV (Image credit: Roku)

When the Tom's Guide staff collected a list of 33 popular apps (and 3 niche apps) that we need on our streaming devices we found that Roku had all but one of the niche apps (NJPW World a Japanese pro wrestling app that's only on Fire TV). The Fire TV lacks Peacock Vudu and the built-in media player (with DLNA) that you get on Roku. That media player is also categorized as a niche app that many could live without instead using Plex (available on both platforms).

Peacock's absence on Firesticks could be a big deal for you but it's not a big problem (yet). Maybe that changes when the WWE Network is only available on Peacock in mid-march.

Winner: Tie

Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV: Special features

The Fire TV devices benefit from Amazon's Alexa skills and connected smart home devices. That means you can check your smart home-connected live cameras around the house view the weather forecast and even order a pizza all with your voice. These features work on all Fire Sticks.

Roku has third party options such as IP Camera Viewer - Pro  but it's still much more of a device meant for streaming than being a part of your smart home. That being said the Roku platform supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa for commands.

Winner: Amazon Fire TV

Roku vs. Amazon Fire TV Stick: Verdict

And there you have it our battle of the Roku devices and Amazon Fire Sticks has a winner. When it's time to stream you want to go with Roku.

This Roku vs Amazon Fire TV Stick face-off has clearly explained how the former wins. It's got the cheaper 4K device better hardware overall and an interface that you control (and not one that just spams you with Prime Video content).

On top of that Roku is not lacking anything in the apps section (thanks HBO Max) not that Fire TV's missing Peacock is a huge flaw. Sure folks plugged into the smart home lifestyle may prefer the connectivity of the Firesticks and the Amazon ecosystem but in our book you buy a streaming device to stream content — and that's why Roku gets the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9yZWFkaW5nLWFuZC13cml0aW5nLWZpbGVzLWZyb20tdG8tYW1hem9uLXMzLXdpdGgtcGFuZGFzLWNjYWY5MGJmZTg2Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reading and writing files to/from Amazon S3 with Pandas,"Reading and writing files from/to Amazon S3 with Pandas

NWS hydrologist Mark Fuchs said the second-lowest level to ever be recorded at their gauge at the Missouri River Bridge took place Friday when the river reached -0.42 feet below zero gauge.

The record low level occurred in February 1908 when it hit -1.1 feet below zero gauge.

When a river gauge reads zero or in the negative numbers it does not mean the river has gone totally dry or is running below ground Fuchs noted. It means the gauge is reading at or below the agreed-upon zero level.

The formation occurred Tuesday about 5 miles upstream from the bridge. At that time the river was running at about 4 feet below the normal 9-foot level.

As temperatures rise Fuchs said the river level will go up. Although there are above-normal amounts of snow along the river it shouldn't have much effect on the river's levels as it melts.

""There's also been drought in the Dakotas and in Nebraska along the river and those areas didn't get any significant snows from this latest round of winter weather"" Fuchs said.

Also keeping an eye on the ice are officials at Ameren Missouri. Spokesman Brad Brown said the utility company is watching the ice situation around Bagnell Dam at the Lake of the Ozarks which has been a key power-generating source for Ameren during this past week of arctic cold.

""It's highly unusual for the Lake of the Ozarks to completely freeze over and that shows just how extreme the weather has been in the past week"" Brown said. ""Lake discharges were higher earlier this week than they are now.""

Last Sunday Bagnell Dam had an average discharge between 35000-36000 cubic feet per second. By the end of the week it was down to 12000 cubic feet per second.

Brown said Ameren understands the concerns dock owners have been expressing about potential damage to docks due to the change of lake levels.

""We are balancing that with our need to supply energy to our customers and supporting the energy grid"" Brown said. ""We're also working with the Army Corps of Engineers and National Weather Service to support vital operations including municipal water intakes downstream on the Missouri River due to the ice near Jefferson City.""

U.S. Coast Guard officials said Friday they were transmitting a broadcast notice to mariners alerting all river traffic users of the icing situation on the Missouri River.

""The ice appears to be an ice bridge and not an ice dam due to the prevailing evidence that water has continued to flow beneath it"" Lt. Jim Long said. ""The Coast Guard will continue to support the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City District as the lead federal agency in determining the appropriate actions needed to ensure the river remains navigable.""",,,,,,

American Airlines and JetBlue Airways are joining forces in the Northeast as part of an alliance that creates new routes schedules frequent flyer programs and more.

The duo is moving forward with the first phase of a ""Northeast alliance"" following a regulatory review from the Department of Transportation that wrapped in January. JetBlue and American flight codes will be placed on over 70 flights between the two airlines under a codeshare agreement allowing customers to book certain flights on either airline or website.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Our alliance with American opens the door for JetBlue to successfully enter into new markets introducing more choices and our award-winning service and low fares to more customers"" Scott Laurence JetBlue's head of revenue and planning said.

American has been joining forces with coastal airlines like JetBlue on the East Coast and Alaska Airlines on the West Coast to fill the gaps in its route network. Both American and JetBlue will add 33 new routes combined to domestic and international destinations as travel slowly rebounds with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and growing testing for entry options in foreign countries.

Here's where travelers will see the biggest differences.

New routes from the Northeast

JetBlue is adding 15 new routes from New York City's three main area airports John F. Kennedy International Newark Liberty International and LaGuardia. American for its part will add 18 new routes from Kennedy International and LaGuardia as well as JetBlue's stronghold at Boston's Logan International Airport.

From Kennedy International two JetBlue new routes will be added to Boise Idaho and Kalispell Montana in July. Both are located in the Mountain West a region that's been surging in popularity during the pandemic as Americans seek social distancing in nature.

On American new routes from Kennedy to the Colombian cities of Cali Bogota and Medellin; Santiago Chile; St. Lucia; and Providenciales Turks and Caicos will start in May and June. Previously announced routes from New York to Tel Aviv Israel Athens Greece and Rio de Janeiro Brazil also launch this year.

American will also give New York City its first non-stop link to Orange County California as the airline is adding a new route from Kennedy starting July 2. The daily flight will be operated by American's ultra-premium Airbus A321 aircraft with first class business class and economy class seats.

Newark will see 10 new routes to the existing JetBlue leisure destinations of Antigua; Aguadilla Puerto Rico; Cartagena Colombia; Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts; Nantucket Massachusetts; Port-au-Prince Haiti; Puerto Plata Dominican Republic; Seattle; St. Lucia; and St. Thomas US Virgin Islands. The new routes start on July 1.

LaGuardia will receive more routes across the East Coast and to the west. JetBlue flights to Charleston South Carolina; Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts; and Denver also begin July 1. while American will launch and resume summer season flights to Key West Florida; Pensacola Florida; Rapid City South Dakota; Kansas City Missouri; and Savannah Georgia in June.

And from Boston American will also fly to Asheville North Carolina; Columbus Ohio; Jackson Hole Wyoming; Traverse City Michigan; and Wilmington North Carolina this summer.

Better schedules and more first class

The two airlines are coordinating schedules in key markets so passengers have more choices when they fly. American will notice the difference on six segments in particular including Boston-South Florida Boston-Washington New York-Washington New York-Boston New York-South Florida and New York-California.

JetBlue flyers will notice the difference on the Boston-Los Angeles Boston-Chicago New York-San Francisco New York-Atlanta New York-Dallas New York-Chicago and New York-Raleigh North Carolina segments.

On the popular New York-Los Angeles route for example the airlines will offer a combined 14 daily flights. Both American and JetBlue operate the route with Airbus A321 aircraft with business class cabins.

American also plans to offer first class on all of its New York-originating flight as it retires smaller regional jets like the Embraer ERJ145. JetBlue currently offers business class on select routes to popular destinations.

Loyalty has its perks

Frequent flyers from both airlines will also benefit as they'll be able to earn miles when flying on either starting this spring. Both airlines will soon allow customers to use points and miles to book award tickets on each other's flights but that functionality will come ""over time.""

A JetBlue loyalist might be able to book an award ticket from New York to Tel Aviv on American as Israel is currently well beyond JetBlue's scope of service.

Elite status holders may also receive reciprocal benefits when traveling on the two but specifics including whether that includes complimentary first class upgrades have yet to be announced.

JetBlue elites currently do not receive upgrades into the airline's swanky Mint business class cabin while American offers its status holders complimentary upgrades on select flights. Upgrades are a key perk of frequent flying that keep customers loyal to a particular airline since a single upgrade can be worth hundreds of dollars and yield free meals early boarding opportunities and even complimentary lounge access.

Better single-itinerary options

The codeshare agreement opens the door for single-itinerary bookings for connecting flights simplifying the travel experience for those that can't get to their final destination on either American or JetBlue alone.

A JetBlue flyer in Buffalo for example could book a one-stop trip from New York to Athens Greece on a mix of JetBlue and American flights under one itinerary.

The move also eliminates the need for self-connections between the two airlines where passengers book two separate tickets. While a widely-used practice it can have downsides if one of the flights is canceled or delayed.

Flights can already be booked under the codeshare agreement that starts on February 25.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWEzMjF0LW9yYW5nZS1jb3VudHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wow: American Airlines Will Fly Ultra-Premium A321T To Orange County,"A few days ago American Airlines and JetBlue Airways announced a slew of new routes as part of their new Northeast strategic alliance. While I covered those new routes big-picture in a separate post I dedicated a separate post to what I found to be the most interesting route addition.

I wanted to provide an update on this as the flight is now on sale and in the process the schedule has also been revealed.

American will fly A321Ts between JFK & SNA

As of July 2 2021 American Airlines will launch daily nonstop flights between New York (JFK) and Orange County (SNA). These flights will operate with the following schedule:

AA991 New York to Orange County departing 5:10PM arriving 8:48PM

AA976 Orange County to New York departing 9:25PM arriving 6:25AM (+1 day)

The 2437 mile flight is blocked at 6hr38min westbound and 6hr eastbound. It’s interesting to see the schedule on this — I’m sure some will like the flight timing (especially the evening westbound departure) while others may not like it so much (especially the eastbound redeye).

The most surprising part of this new route is the aircraft American will use — American plans to fly an A321T between New York and Orange County. For those of you not familiar with this subfleet of A321s these are the planes that have historically been operated exclusively from New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco (they’ll soon again be flown from Boston to Los Angeles).

These planes are unique as they feature just 102 seats and include four seating options:

There are 10 first class fully flat reverse herringbone seats with direct aisle access in a 1-1 configuration

There are 20 business class fully flat seats in a 2-2 configuration

There are 72 economy seats with 36 of those seats being Main Cabin Extra featuring extra legroom

American Airlines’ A321T first class

Seeing American schedule A321Ts in this market is both surprising and not surprising:

On the one hand this has historically been reserved for the transcon markets that are known to have a ton of premium demand particularly among business travelers and the entertainment crowd

While Orange County is quite affluent it doesn’t have quite the entertainment or business demand of the other markets; I would have expected to see an A321T between New York and Burbank before something like this

I wonder if this might have something to do with SNA’s runway length; the airport has a short runway and the A321T is lighter than the standard A321 so has better performance for airports like this



American Airlines’ A321T business class

Could we see more A321T routes from American?

American has a significant surplus of A321Ts and it seems like that will continue to be the case:

This is especially true during the pandemic given the complete lack of demand between New York and California

In general there had been rumors of American reconfiguring A321Ts into a more standard configuration though there has been nothing concrete there

With the new American & JetBlue Northeast partnership it seems that we can expect a reduction in American service between New York and Los Angeles:

American and JetBlue will operate a combined 14 daily flights between the New York-area (JFK & EWR) and Los Angeles (LAX); that flying will be split pretty evenly between the two airlines

Previously American operated up to a dozen flights per day in the market using its own A321Ts

American & JetBlue will split flying between JFK & LAX

It goes without saying that American will have more A321Ts in the future than it needs assuming American and JetBlue do in fact plan to decrease transcon service to the extent that has been revealed.

Only time will tell whether American chooses to launch more A321T routes or if some of these planes will simply be reconfigured.

Bottom line

American Airlines will launch daily A321T flights between New York and Orange County as of the summer of 2021. This will only be the third route to have this aircraft regularly scheduled.

This announcement definitely caught me off guard — while Orange County is a premium leisure market this still seems surprising.

We’ll have to see what the future holds for American’s A321Ts — will the airline reconfigure A321Ts fly these planes in more markets or eventually increase service from JFK to LAX and SFO?

Are you surprised to see American flying A321Ts between JFK & SNA?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL2ZhYS1vcmRlcnMtaW5zcGVjdGlvbnMtb2YtYm9laW5nLTc3N3MtYWZ0ZXItZGVudmVyLWJsYXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAA orders inspections of Boeing 777s after Denver blast,"The Federal Aviation Administration on Sunday issued an emergency airworthiness directive calling for immediate or stepped-up inspections of planes similar to the one that caught fire over Denver this weekend.

The order covers Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines and “will likely mean that some airplanes will be removed from service” FAA administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement.

The order came after a United Airlines passenger jet powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines suffered a fiery mid-air engine failure on Saturday forcing an emergency landing.

No injuries were reported on board the Honolulu-bound jet despite the dramatic videos showing one of the engines on fire and rattling loose.

There were also no reports of injuries in suburban Broomfield where huge chunks of engine and debris landed in yards parks and on vehicles.

An initial review of the incident showed that “inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes” Dickson said.

United is the only US operator with the PW4000 engine type in its fleet.

The airline said Sunday it would voluntarily and temporarily remove its 24 active planes with that engine type from its schedule.

“As we swap out aircraft we expect only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced” United said in a statement.

The airline said it would continue to work with regulators “to determine any additional steps that are needed to ensure these aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards and can return to service.”

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were the two largest airlines in the US before the pandemic each generating billions in revenue each year and boasting the largest fleets of any global airline. Both offered similar products with the choice between the two coming down to factors like customer preference price and loyalty.

The divide between them widened during the pandemic however thanks to one key factor: safety. While Delta blocked middle seats through for most of 2020 American filled its planes to capacity as early as the summer.

I flew on both carriers in June 2020 on my first trip back to the skies since the pandemic began and found Delta to be a far sight better than American largely because of the former's above and beyond approach to safety. But as we enter a new year in aviation's recovery I wanted to see just how the two were faring nearly one year since COVID-19 upended aviation.

I took three flights across both airlines on a recent trip flying from New York to Miami on American and then from Houston Texas to Los Angeles via Salt Lake City on Delta. The result was surprising especially as the US continues to see record COVID-19-related deaths and a slow-going vaccine rollout.

Now He Owes $16752. (Published 2021),"SAN ANTONIO — As millions of Texans shivered in dark cold homes over the past week while a winter storm devastated the state’s power grid and froze natural gas production those who could still summon lights with the flick of a switch felt lucky.

Now many of them are paying a severe price for it.

“My savings is gone” said Scott Willoughby a 63-year-old Army veteran who lives on Social Security payments in a Dallas suburb. He said he had nearly emptied his savings account so that he would be able to pay the $16752 electric bill charged to his credit card — 70 times what he usually pays for all of his utilities combined. “There’s nothing I can do about it but it’s broken me.”

Mr. Willoughby is among scores of Texans who have reported skyrocketing electric bills as the price of keeping lights on and refrigerators humming shot upward. For customers whose electricity prices are not fixed and are instead tied to the fluctuating wholesale price the spikes have been astronomical.

The outcry elicited angry calls for action from lawmakers from both parties and prompted Gov.

Renewable energy remains red-hot even after a scorching 2020 where renewables trounced the broader market's gains. From small pure-play wind and solar stocks to large companies looking to diversify their revenue mix now seems to be a great time to look for premium renewable energy stocks. But there's a problem. Many of the industry's leading companies are now trading near record highs -- which can be off-putting for investors looking for a lower entry point.

With that we asked some of our contributors which renewable energy stocks they thought were cheap now. They came up with American Electric Power (AEP 1.19%) Dominion Energy (D 1.38%) and Hubbell (HUBB 1.30%).

Power your portfolio with a utility player

Scott Levine (American Electric Power): While politicians debate the role that green energy has played in the Texas power outages smart investors recognize that the political wrangling doesn't detract from the fact that renewable energy stocks represent significant growth opportunities. The challenge for clean-energy-minded investors though is where to turn. Although solar wind and geothermal stocks all represent viable options from which investors can choose American Electric Power (AEP) provides a less obvious approach. And fortunately for investors they can currently find shares in the bargain bin.

Branding itself as ""the premier regulated energy company"" AEP has a presence in 11 states and provides electricity to about 5.5 million customers making it one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States. Management has articulated a clear commitment to environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) values. For example the company is targeting a 42% reduction in its coal capacity by 2030 and it plans on supplanting this in part with ample green energy additions. Over the next 10 years AEP expects to add 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power to its power portfolio and 4.2 GW of wind power.

Unlike the majority of renewable energy stocks that don't reward shareholders by way of a dividend AEP has demonstrated consistent interest in returning capital to investors. Over the past decade AEP -- currently offering investors an attractive 3.8% dividend yield on its stock -- has steadily raised its distribution and it seems intent on continuing that trend.

Management expects to return $2.96 per share to investors in 2021 -- about 4.2% more than it dished out in 2020. Allaying concerns that the company is jeopardizing its financial well-being to please investors with the dividend management has targeted a payout ratio of 60% to 70% -- a range that seems reasonable considering the company's average payout ratio over the past three years has been 62%.

Currently shares of AEP appear attractively priced from a couple of different angles. For one the stock is trading at 20.3 times earnings representing a discount to its five-year average multiple of 27.3. Similarly the stock is trading at 2.6 times sales. While this is slightly higher than its five-year average ratio of 2.4 the valuation is still reasonable considering the S&P 500 P/S ratio is 2.9.

Transitioning from natural gas to renewables

Daniel Foelber (Dominion Energy): Dominion energy is the latest utility stock to launch an aggressive push into renewable energy. The company is a leading energy provider in Utah Ohio Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina. Although Dominion's portfolio is still mostly fossil fuels it has done a good job of moving away from coal toward natural gas over the past 15 years. Its sale of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and other gas transmission and distribution assets to Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway last year marked the first major step in its push to transition away from gas and toward renewables.

That push accelerated further when the company reported fourth-quarter results. Bigger than the numbers themselves was the company's brand new $32 billion five-year capital spending program 52% of which is devoted toward zero-carbon through offshore wind solar energy storage and nuclear relicensing. Offshore wind in particular is a big catalyst for Dominion's growth led by the company's 2.6 GW megaproject that is expected to go into service in 2024.

Impressively enough Dominion is confident that even with the hefty spending plan it will be able to grow earnings per share by at least 6.5% over the next five years. This forecast should be fairly accurate considering 88% of Dominion's existing portfolio is state-regulated. The company also plans to grow its dividend at 6% over the long term. In an effort to fund its renewable aspirations Dominion cut its quarterly dividend from $0.94 per share to $0.63 in December of last year. Even with the cut Dominion yields an impressive 3.5% -- much higher than the current market average of 1.5%.

Given the company's strong existing portfolio aggressive and profitable renewable investments and the fact that shares are on sale for 20% less than a year ago Dominion looks to be a worthwhile renewable energy stock to buy now.

Renewable energy provides growth for Hubbell

Lee Samaha (Hubbell): The words ""cheap"" and ""renewable energy stock"" don't often fit together these days. Therefore if you are looking for a value option you will have to think outside the box or rather outside the sweep of a wind power turbine.

In this context what about buying a highly cash generative value stock with some exposure to renewable energy related spending? That's where electrical and electronic products company Hubbell comes into play. If you are going to have investment in renewable energy farms you are going to need investment in the transmission and distribution (T&D) network as well.

Hubbell's exposure comes through its utility solutions segment responsible for 57% of adjusted operating profit in 2020 with electrical solutions making up the rest. Commenting on the fourth-quarter performance on the earnings release CEO Gerben Bakker said ""In the fourth quarter utility facing markets remained resilient with grid modernization and renewable energy trends driving ongoing strength in demand for T&D components and mid single digit growth in Power Systems.""

Looking ahead management expects its utility T&D components end market to grow 2% to 4% and utility communications and controls to grow 4% to 6%. Coupled with a recovery in the electrical solutions end market management expects Hubbell's sales to grow 6% to 8% with organic sales up 3% to 5%. Management's guidance implies around $495 million in free cash flow (FCF) putting Hubbell on a forward price-to-FCF multiple of 18.5 times.

That's a good value particularly if growth in spending on utility T&D will support mid-single-digit revenue growth over the medium term."

View the current offers here.

College students are at a big disadvantage when it comes to racking up points and miles since most have limited income and little to no credit history. This makes some of the best points and miles cards just out of their reach.

The Chase Freedom Unlimited resolves this dilemma while still providing outsized benefits to those with limited credit history. Read on to see why it should be the first card on every college student's list.

1. No annual fee to worry about

They really put the ""free"" in Freedom Unlimited — as long as you pay your bills on time and avoid using the card abroad Chase will never charge you a penny for renewing this card. That means more cash in your pocket to spend on food and activities while you're traveling. But there's a long-term benefit to this as well: You can keep this card open forever without worrying about an annual fee and boost your credit score at the same time.

A variety of factors determine your FICO score the most widely used credit score.

As 15% of your credit score is determined by the length of your credit history you can keep your no-annual-fee card open for a long time and see a boost in your credit score.

Before you apply for your first credit card it's important to know what your credit score is and to fully understand the factors that influence it. If you miss payments or spend money that you don't have just to earn points it will wind up costing you in both the short term and long term — and you'll end up paying way more than any value you get in rewards.

2. It's relatively easy to get approved

(Photo by John Gribben for The Points Guy)

Because the Freedom Unlimited has a moderate sign-up bonus — earn $200 after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months from account opening — and fewer perks than some of Chase's more premium alternatives it's generally one of the easier entry-level cards to get approved for.

Building credit is like chutes and ladders; a few approvals can boost your score quickly but a rejection early on can set you back in the short term. It helps to be conservative in the early stages and apply for cards that you're more likely to get approved for.

3. Build credit and establish a good relationship with the issuer

It takes years of consistent payments and responsible spending to build up your credit score but it helps to make some friends along the way. If you're new to credit and you show Chase (or any credit issuer) that you can be responsible with the first card it gives you — make all your payments on time keep a low balance-to-limit ratio etc. — they will be much more likely to approve you for other valuable cards down the line.

4. Low minimum spending requirement for the sign-up bonus

Many of the best credit cards on the market have minimum spending requirements of $3000 to $5000 in the first three months but how are you supposed to do that if you don't even have that much money in the bank? Fortunately the Freedom Unlimited is much more manageable as it comes with a $200 bonus after spending $500 in the first three months for new applicants. This low minimum spending requirement should be attainable for most and start you on your way to earning some easy cash.

In addition to the generous sign-up bonus on the no-annual-fee Freedom Unlimited card new cardholders will earn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase 3% on dining — including takeout — and drugstores and 1.5% on all other purchases.

5. The bonus can easily be worth several hundred dollars

The Freedom Unlimited has a sign-up bonus of $200 (or potentially 20000 Ultimate Rewards points) after spending $500 on purchases within the first three months. While on the surface you're getting $200 back after meeting minimum spending requirements you can also convert the $200 into 20000 points and redeem for travel shopping at Amazon.com or buying gift cards through the Ultimate Rewards portal.

If your income situation improves and you've demonstrated responsible credit card habits over a period of time you can consider adding a card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. With a more premium card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred you can convert the cash back into Ultimate Rewards points — and transfer the points to 13 airline and hotel travel partners or redeem through the Chase travel portal. TPG values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece so the 20000 points earned from the sign-up bonus could be worth up to $400 or more.

6. Amazing long-term earning potential

After you open your Freedom Unlimited you'll be one step closer to possessing the ""Chase Trifecta"" of credit cards. Here's how it breaks down:

Chase Freedom Unlimited: 5% cash back (5x Ultimate Rewards points) on travel booked through the Ultimate Rewards portal 3% cash back (3x points) on dining and drugstores and 1.5% cash back (1.5x points) on every purchase.

Chase Sapphire Reserve: The Sapphire family offers either 2x (Preferred) or 3x (Reserve) points on dining and travel. The Reserve has a high annual fee of $550 but comes with plenty of premium travel benefits.

Ink Business Preferred Credit Card: This card offers 3x points on travel shipping internet cable phone services and advertising purchases made with social media sites and search engines (up to $150000 in combined spending each account anniversary year). It might not make sense when you're a college student but it could become a useful card down the line.

Remember: While the Freedom Unlimited has strong earning potential on its own it's technically just a cash-back card. To unlock Ultimate Rewards sweet spot redemptions you need to pair it with a premium UR-earning card like the Sapphire Preferred. In addition to all the reasons mentioned above it's wise to start with the Freedom Unlimited card as you'll begin accruing valuable points without paying an annual fee. When you eventually get around to opening a Sapphire card you'll already have plenty of points earned in your account and ready to use for a graduation trip.

7. The 5/24 rule

When you first start collecting points and miles you're bound to be overwhelmed by a bunch of jargon. Abbreviations such as URs and MRs (Chase Ultimate Rewards points and American Express Membership Rewards points respectively) are commonly used among points and miles enthusiasts and can be quite confusing for those starting off and that's okay.

You can and should learn as you go but it helps to be aware of one thing from the start when it comes to applying for Chase cards: the issuer's infamous 5/24 rule. Simply put if you've opened five or more credit cards in the last 24 months (across all issuers) Chase will automatically reject you for most of its credit cards. This means that you generally want to start by filling up your five ""slots"" with Chase before moving on and the Freedom Unlimited is a great way to start.

Bottom line

College (if not sooner) is the perfect time to start establishing a credit history and the Chase Freedom Unlimited is an excellent beginner credit card for students.

The inaugural edition of the FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship an online team competition for companies has a surprisingly large and strong turnout. With a total of 284 teams from 78 different countries registered the event will bring together 1467 players.

The list of participating companies includes giants like Amazon Samsung Ford Microsoft Gazprom Facebook Siemens Dell Technologies Bosch Airbus IBM Boeing Sony Intel ArcelorMittal Equinor HP Twitter Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Vodafone Sberbank American Express Deutsche Bank UBS Oracle Credit Suisse and Airbnb.

The line-ups of the teams are fairly impressive as well. Especially nice is the participation of the world champion who represents the company Kindred the online gambling operator of e.g. Unibet that has been sponsoring Carlsen since early 2020. Giri is logically playing for Optiver a Dutch trading firm that has supported him during the past five years of his career.

Other top players are playing by invitation as companies were allowed to have one invited player for the event. In total 204 titled players will take part in the competition including 36 grandmasters.

There are also some top executives playing for their teams like Bernhard Spalt CEO of Erste Group Bank and Tomislav Topic who is the CEO of the telecom company Telconet in Ecuador.

However the strongest executive is the two-time French champion and former top player GM Joel Lautier a member of the Supervisory Board of Sovcombank who will make a temporary comeback to play in the championship.

Format

Each team consists of four players including at least one male player and at least one female player. In each team only one player can have a standard rating higher than 2500 in the FIDE rating list for November 2020.

Registered teams are divided into two pools (East & West) of approximately equal strength and of close time zones. Pool matches are played on February 19 and 20. Qualified teams enter the playoff phase played on February 21.

The Eastern pool matches begin at 7 a.m. Pacific (16:00 CET). The Western pool matches begin at 5:30 p.m. Pacific (2:30 a.m. the next day CET). The time control is 10 minutes plus a 2-second increment for the whole game.

Donations

There was no entry fee of any kind for this competition. However FIDE is organizing a fund-raiser in cooperation with the platform Softgiving  and participating companies are encouraged to donate towards one of three social projects currently being developed by FIDE: Chess in Education programs for underprivileged children Chess for people with Disabilities and the FIDE veterans support program. If you also want to contribute you can do it through this link:

Kamala Harris isn’t the only Black woman making history in 2021.

The January 20 swearing-in of the nation’s first woman Black and southeast Asian vice president came at a pivotal moment for Black women in the business world which up until recently has failed miserably to increase the number of Black executives — male and female — in its ranks.

In 2018 only 3.3% of all US corporate executive and senior leadership positions were filled by Black people. Not much has changed since then according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

To date there have been only 19 Black CEOs — 17 men and two women — in the entire history of the list which was first published in Fortune magazine in 1955. Incoming Walgreen’s CEO Rosalind Brewer will be added on March 15 when she becomes just the third Black woman to serve as a Fortune 500 CEO.

But experts say there currently aren’t enough Black women in the c-suite pipeline at most major companies to narrow the gap between Black and White women who are also underrepresented in executive leadership.

In honor of Black History Month CNN Business asked three of the highest ranked Black women in corporate America to reflect on their career journeys and offer advice to those looking to follow in their footsteps.

Jasmin Allen SVP Hennessy U.S. Hennessy U.S.

Jasmin Allen SVP Hennessy U.S. at Moet Hennessy USA:

Hometown: Alexandria Virginia

Education: B.S. in finance from the University of Virginia (2002). M.B.A. from Duke University (2008)

Specialty: Marketing

Industry: Luxury goods spirits

Career advice: “It’s OK for you to make decisions in your career even if they’re not popular. If you in your heart feel that job or that path is for you then you have to go for it because nobody knows you better than you.”

Allen made history in December when she was chosen to head US operations for Hennessy becoming the brand’s highest ranking Black executive. She’s now responsible for maximizing the image equity and profitability for the company’s popular line of spirits.

Allen has spent most of her career developing and executing marketing strategies to sell alcohol and soft drinks. Her tenure at Moet Hennessy USA the US sales and marketing division representing LVMH wine and spirit brands began as a brand director for Belvedere vodka in 2016 and the company said Allen launched several successful campaigns that grew the brand. She also spent more than eight years at Coca-Cola where she designed custom Dasani bottled water packaging for the 2010 Winter Olympics and FIFA World Cup.

Allen’s latest promotion came after a roller coaster year for both Hennessy and its parent company LVMH (LVMHF) which took major hits to its bottom line — domestically and internationally — when the covid-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of retail stores bars and restaurants that sell LVMH (LVMHF)-owned products. The conglomerate’s spirit brands led its rebound during the second half of 2020 with Allen’s help.

Both LVMH and the larger luxury goods industry have for years been criticized for using Black culture themes and celebrities to market products while failing to hire more Black fashion designers and business executives. Throughout her career Allen says she’s grown accustomed to being one of the few if not the only Black face in the room but she’s never let it deter her from her goals. She credits advice her father gave her in high school when she campaigned to become her school’s first Black senior class president for helping her persevere in the face of institutional adversity.

“My father said to me ‘Jasmin just because there’s never been doesn’t mean there can’t be’” she said. “This advice from him sums up my approach to being a Black woman who aspires to ascend.”

Bonita C. Stewart VP of Global Partnerships Google Damani Moyd

Bonita C. Stewart VP of Global Partnerships Google:

Hometown: Denver Colorado

Education: B.A. in journalism from Howard University (1979). M.B.A. from Harvard Business School (1983)

Specialty: Global partnerships

Industry: Tech

Career advice: “We must redirect more Black women to profit and loss responsibility versus cost areas (such as HR and operations) earlier in their careers. Also we need more sponsors to provide the ‘stretch’ assignments that catapult careers through unique learning experiences.”

Stewart is a proud Howard University graduate who in 2012 became the first Black woman to serve as a vice president at Google. She has been leading Google’s global partnerships team — managing search mobile apps broadcast commerce news telecommunications and domains for the company’s largest US publishers — since 2016.

Stewart has earned many prestigious awards over the course of her career which spans more than four decades even though she admits business wasn’t her original career choice.

“[My dream was] becoming a broadcast news journalist until I discovered business through my minor and served as the advertising manager for Howard’s school newspaper the Hilltop” Stewart told CNN Business. “Thereafter I made a choice to attend either law school or business school. [I] chose business school for greater career optionality and the opportunity to lead a company and carve my own path.”

Stewart’s first taste of the tech world came in 1979 when she began work as a marketing rep for IBM. She joined Google in 2006 after a successful stint in the automotive industry with DaimlerChrysler AG helming Chrysler’s $400 million advertising and marketing operation and earning an Interactive Marketer of the Year Award from Advertising Age in 2005.

Her long list of career accomplishments includes spearheading Google’s Howard West tech exchange initiative in 2015. Google has worked to strengthen its partnerships with Howard and other HBCUs even more this year after coming under fire in December for parting ways with prominent AI researcher Timnit Gebru and former diversity recruiter April Curley. Both Gebru and Curley are Black women who accused the company of fostering a hostile work environment.

Stewart and Google did not respond to request for comment on Gebru and Curley’s allegations but Stewart said the company’s emerging evolution as a more-diverse team in 2020 has been one of her proudest accomplishments.

“As a Black woman I’ve worked in male-dominated industries for most of my career” Stewart said. “While it has been a unique challenge I’ve been very comfortable being the pioneer and forging a pathway for others. I brought courage every step of the way.”

Susan Chapman-Hughes EVP Digital Capabilities Transformation and Operations American Express photographed in November 2018. John O'Boyle

Susan Chapman-Hughes EVP Global Digital Capabilities Transformation and Operations American Express:

Hometown: Cincinnati

Education: B.S. in engineering from Vanderbilt University (1990). M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin (1998)

Specialty: Digital transformation and strategic leadership

Industry: Financial services

Career advice: “Be really excited about the opportunities that exist ahead of you. Recognize you need help to make that happen. Be humble enough to get the feedback and get the help you need to make it work. There’s no way I could be sitting in the seat I’m in without the help I’ve had.”

One of the career-defining moments in Chapman’s life came in 1995 when she won an essay competition organized by the Executive Leadership Council a pipeline organization for emerging Black business executives and was invited to a national honors symposium to meet some of its senior members.

At that meeting Chapman and her fellow contest winners met some of the most successful Black executives in the country including Ursula Burns who later became CEO of Xerox and Kenneth Chenault who went on to become chief executive at American Express where Chapman’s career later flourished.

“We met with all these Black executives which was phenomenal because so many of us had never had exposure to them” Chapman said. “It allowed me to start developing relationships with so many of them where they coached me and gave me mentoring and counseling and advice as I started to navigate my way through it.”

The contest winners and the c-suite executives stayed connected and went on to found a global Black leadership network now known as Calibr.

Chapman says Black business pros can certainly have mentor relationships with people who aren’t African American but having Black mentors is also key to their success.

“There is nothing like somebody who’s walked a mile in the shoes you want to walk in” she said."

Companies could explore a traditional IPO or a SPAC deal to bring their insurance companies public.

Oscar Health: Health insurance company Oscar Health is planning to IPO in 2021. The company uses a technology-minded approach to offer small group and Medicare Advantage plans.

Health plans are currently offered in 18 U.S. states with a focus on larger ones such as Florida Texas and California.

The company said 47% of its subscribers are active monthly users including 44% of users over the age of 55.

Oscar Health has 529000 members and had revenue of $1.67 billion in fiscal 2020. Revenue in the prior year was $1.04 billion.

Shares are expected to trade as OSCR on the NYSE. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is an investor in Oscar Health.

Hippo: Homeowner insurance company Hippo raised $250 million in November and is considering going public according to Bloomberg.

The company was linked to a SPAC deal with Reinvent Technology Partners (NYSE: RTP) a SPAC led by Mark Pincus and Reid Hoffman.

Hippo sells coverage online and is seeing fast growth. The company acquired Spinnaker Insurance recently and has expanded into more states over the last 12 months.

Hippo acquired a home maintenance platform in 2019 that could help the company diversify beyond insurance.

American International Group: Insurance company American International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG) is working on spinning off its life insurance and retirement business. The company is exploring options for selling a stake of this unit.

New CEO Peter Zaffino told Bloomberg that the proceeds possibly could be used for share buybacks.

“Our current expectation is that an initial disposition of 19.9% of life and retirement whether through a minority IPO or sale to a third party will generate net proceeds such that some portion can be used toward further share repurchases” Zaffino said.

Investors should watch to see if this unit becomes a 2021 IPO.

Migo’s family and colleagues watched live and via streaming video as she joined an elite group of senior enlisted Airmen that is only attained by 1% of the enlisted force.



Migo the daughter of Faatamalii and Maiava Leo is the first born-and-raised American Samoan woman to be promoted to the rank of chief master sergeant which made the ceremony even more unique. She may be the first American Samoan ever to achieve this rank.



American Samoa is a U.S. territory covering five South Pacific islands and two atolls which is slightly larger than Washington D.C. It is the home to just over fifty-thousand people. Living in such a small area meant that “our culture focused on God family respect service and love” Migo said.



Migo describes life in her hometown of Pago Pago as simple and strict mostly because “with six girls in a row my parents had to be (strict).” Migo is her parents’ third child out of 11 children (six girls and five boys) - including one nephew who was raised as a sibling.



Her early life focused on school and church playing sports at both places. “My mom was our number-one cheerleader” Migo recalls “her voice would echo through the field or across the court.”



American Samoa is the home of the U.S. military’s most successful recruiting stations as it has the highest rate of military enlistment of any U.S. state or territory. Migo’s family has a long line of service in the U.S. military including many of her immediate and extended family.



When Migo started high school her second eldest sister joined the U.S. Coast Guard; she recently retired after 24 years of honorable service. The next year her eldest sister joined the U.S. Army. Since then two more of her sisters have served and one brother is also currently serving in the military.



Migo her high school class valedictorian joined the U.S. Air Force in 1998 because she met the service’s high test score requirements on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery exam. The tropical islander volunteered for Elmendorf Air Force Base Alaska to be her first duty station because she had family members living in the area.



During the ceremony Col. Francisco Gallei 505th Test and Training Group commander noted that Migo was a highly-accomplished Airman who has received many accolades over her career. “Not only has she been recognized with two major command-level awards one in Pacific Command and the other in North American Aerospace Defense Command as their Command and Control Battle Management Operator of the Year” Gallei announced “she was also the Air Force-level award winner last year.”



Gallei then looked to the audience and told her three children: Shelton Terrence and Alayah –their mother often says they are her greatest accomplishment. Migo emphasized this after her children placed the ceremonial chief master sergeant insignia on her uniform. “My success comes from the man above my family my friends coworkers and mentors.”



COVID-19 restrictions prevented many of her family from traveling to witness the ceremony in person especially in American Samoa. To them Migo reiterated how important American Samoa and her family are to her. “I just changed my last name back to my family name of Migo” she said noting that she had planned to change it before she relocated for her next assignment. “I did so before this ceremony because the time was right; this honors my family my village and American Samoa.”



Though Migo looks back fondly on her career she says she was not a perfect Airman in the beginning and “it has not always been an easy journey.” She had many leaders mentors and family intervene and challenge her to be a better Airman. Her key to success and advice to Airmen is to be “persistent be resilient and to have humility.”



This advice is in line with this Samoan proverb and words of encouragement Migo shared to other American Samoans: “E iloa le Samoa i lona tu tautala ma lona savali” – translated: “You know a Samoan by the way he/she stands speaks and walks.” Migo summarized this with “be proud of your culture and where you come from. Never give up on what you deem important; when you fall or hit a roadblock get back up and try again or re-evaluate and then press on.”



Migo is currently serving as the superintendent of the 505th Test and Training Group. She is the principal advisor to the group commander on all enlisted matters and informs the commander on issues affecting the health morale welfare training and the proper utilization of over 500 personnel assigned to four squadrons three detachments and six operating locations.



CMSgt Loretta V. Washington superintendent for the 316th Medical Support Squadron Joint Base Andrews Maryland knows what a historical and special moment this is for Migo. In 2020 Washington became the first female Samoan to attain the rank of chief master sergeant. Though close to each other Samoa and American Samoa are two separate entities. Samoa is an independent country west of the International Date Line while American Samoa is a U.S. territory east of the International Date Line.



“Some may not understand that joy for someone you have never met” Washington said of Migo “but if you knew our Samoan culture you’d know our humble story began as just two Samoan girls from little islands in the Pacific who joined the United States Air Force with the simple goal of making our parents proud.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vc3RhdGVtYWcuc3RhdGUuZ292LzIwMjEvMDIvMDIyMWl0bjAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Embassy Dhaka Resilience Working Group breathes life into mask program,"We’re sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

Synthetic chemicals called phthalates are damaging children’s brain development and therefore must be immediately banned from consumer products according to a group of scientists and health professionals from Project TENDR.

Project TENDR which stands for Targeting Environmental Neuro-Development Risks is a group of volunteer scientists health professionals and child advocates working to study and reduce children’s exposure to neurotoxic chemicals and pollutants.

“What we want to accomplish is to move the public health community including regulators toward this goal of elimination of phthalates” said lead author Stephanie Engel.

“We have enough evidence right now to be concerned about the impact of these chemicals on a child’s risk of attention learning and behavioral disorders” said Engel a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health.

“I hope that this paper will act as a wake-up call to understand that early life exposure to this class of chemicals is affecting our children” said toxicologist Linda Birnbaum former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences as well as the National Toxicology Program. She was not involved in the paper.

“When you have the same kind of findings repeated in multiple populations done by different investigators using different tools and approaches and you keep coming up with the same finding I think you can begin to say that the data is pretty clear” Birnbaum said.

CNN reached out for comment from the trade association American Chemistry Council.

“While we are encouraged by continuous research efforts into the science and health of phthalates we are concerned about the over interpretation of studies that have not established a causal link between phthalates and human adverse health effects” said Eileen Conneely senior director of the chemical products and technology division of ACC.

‘Everywhere chemicals’

Called “everywhere chemicals” because they are so common phthalates are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break.

Phthalates are found in hundreds of auto home food and personal care items: food packaging; detergents; vinyl flooring clothing furniture and shower curtains; automotive plastics; lubricating oils and adhesives; rain and stain-resistant products; and scores of products including shampoo soap hair spray and nail polish in which they make fragrances last longer.

Phthalates must be listed among the ingredients on product labels unless they are added as a part of the scent. Under current US Food and Drug Administration regulations phthalates can be simply labeled “fragrance” even though they could be as much as 20% of the product studies say.

Phthalates are also in PVC plumbing and building products and items such as medical tubing garden hoses and some children’s toys. Globally approximately 8.4 million metric tonnes of phlathates and other plasticizers are consumed annually according to European Plasticizers an industry trade association.

Studies have connected phthalates to childhood obesity asthma cardiovascular issues cancer and reproductive problems such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and low sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males.

Neurotoxins

The new call to action published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health focuses specifically on the link between phthalate exposure and long-lasting neurodevelopmental harm in fetuses infants and children.

By 2019 more than 30 studies had examined prenatal exposure to different types of phthalates and long-term studies had been done in 11 different countries or territories around the globe the report said. Not all of the papers had found consistent results especially in the area of cognitive development but the report’s authors said that might be due to difference in study designs and children’s ages.

The report said the strongest associations have been found with hyperactivity aggression defiance emotional reactivity delinquent behaviors and other signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD after exposure to phthalates.

One study for example found children of mothers with the highest levels of phthalates in their urine during their second trimester had almost three times the odds of being diagnosed with ADHD as children with mothers who had much lower levels.

A link between phthalate exposure and poorer working memory and intelligence has also been found. One study discovered children who were exposed to higher levels of phthalates in utero had an IQ level that was seven points lower than children with less exposure. The highest-risk kids also had reduced perceptual reasoning and verbal comprehension.

Conneely of the ACC however pointed to recent systematic reviews that pulled together available data on neurobehavioral and cognition effects and “concluded that there was no association between DINP and DIDP and neurobehavioral or cognitive effects.”

Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP) are two of the many types of chemicals in the family of phthalates.

In addition Conneely said “data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clearly show exposure levels to phthalates are well below the levels determined by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory bodies to be safe.”

It’s true that “federal regulation of phthalates in the United States has been minimal with several exceptions including restrictions on 8 phthalates in children’s toys and childcare articles” the study said.

However the study continued “we strongly urge both federal and state agencies to move rapidly to eliminate phthalate use” adding that “states should not wait for the federal government to act as state action can galvanize federal regulation.”

In response to CNN’s request an EPA spokesperson provided the following comment.

“As the Biden-Harris Administration works to advance EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment the agency is committed to ensuring the safety of chemicals used by all Americans.

“The agency is actively working to ensure all (Toxic Substances Control Act) chemical risk evaluations including the ongoing evaluations for seven phthalates follow the science and the law and that any resulting risk management actions protect human health particularly the health of more vulnerable groups like children and workers and the environment.”

Timing of exposure

Unlike toxic metals such as lead arsenic cadmium and mercury phthalates are more rapidly metabolized and typically leave the body once exposure is removed.

“They have much shorter biological half lives than say the heavy metals which can hang around for decades” said David Bellinger a professor of neurology and psychology at Boston Children’s Hospital and a member of Project TENDR who was not involved in the new paper.

The problem Bellinger added is that once the baby’s developing brain is impacted by the chemical in utero the damage has been done.

“The brain might be exposed at just the wrong time” Bellinger said. “That’s the concern.”

Critics argue that studies showing distinct neurodevelopmental harm have only been done in animals while studies on young children focus on behavioral impacts such as increases in behavioral disorders and attention and learning deficits.

“There will never be gold-standard randomized clinical trials” said Birnbaum because science would never deliberately expose a child to such chemicals. That’s the whole issue with environmental exposures.”

Elimination is the goal

The paper called for the elimination of the entire class of phthalates from products that lead to the exposure of pregnant women women of reproductive age infants and children.

Banning them one-by-one won’t adequately lessen the threat Engel said.

“We’re exposed to multiple phthalates and that mixture can come within a single product but also across multiple products that people are exposed to in a day” Engel said. “The reality is that we need to think of phthalates as a class because that’s how people are exposed to them.”

Another reason that the entire class of phthalates should be regulated BIrnbaum said is to keep manufacturers from replacing one “bad actor” with another phthalate that hasn’t been as thoroughly studied.

“This is the whole history of these chemicals” Birnbaum said “whether you call it ‘whack a mole’ or ‘chemical conveyor belt’ or ‘unfortunate substitution.’ We move from one chemical that we have concerns about to another one which we just haven’t studied yet which often turns out to be just as problematic.

“We can’t continue to test these things one at a time” Birnbaum continued. “I could make an argument that if one chemical can be substituted for another without changing the process then why would you think the biology would be different?”

Critics point to the expense of removing an entire class of chemicals from the marketplace.

“Cost is always the counter argument to change” Engel told CNN. “But the current system has costs too. It’s just that we’ve become accustomed to paying them. Right now families health care school systems are shouldering the costs of a lack of health protective regulation for children.”

Engel also argues that elimination of the entire class of chemicals is possible “because manufacturers are already showing us that it’s feasible” and points to a number of actions already taken by the marketplace. Apple the paper said has removed “phthalates as a class from almost all products” while other companies like CVS and The Home Depot have reduced the use of phthalates in beauty personal care products household products and vinyl flooring.

And of course the public can play a significant role in accomplishing change. Boston Children’s Bellinger pointed to the success of angry moms who demanded that companies remove the hormone disruptor Bisphenol A commonly known as BPA from baby bottles and sippy cups.

In reaction to the public uproar six of the major baby bottle manufacturers announced the removal of BPA from their products in March 2009 three years before the FDA banned the chemical from those products at the request of the American Chemistry Council an industry trade group.

“If people just vote with their wallets and let these companies know that they care that’s probably an effective a way to shake this thing loose” Bellinger said.

Other petitions awaiting action

This isn’t the first group to call upon the FDA to consider an entire class of chemicals and their overall impact.

A petition submitted last year by the Environmental Defense Fund and other advocates called upon the FDA to consider the “cumulative effects” of the more than 10000 chemicals allowed to be added to foods and food packaging. Some of those like phthalates and another class of chemicals called PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are known hormone disruptors linked to developmental cognitive and other health problems in babies and adults.

CNN reached out for comment from the FDA on the new study. The agency said it was aware of the study publication and was reviewing the findings.

The FDA spokesperson added that “currently the FDA is reviewing two food additive petitions proposing the agency amend our food additive regulations by removing authorizations for the use of ortho-phthalates in food-contact applications. Completing our review of these petitions and publishing our response in the Federal Register is a priority for the FDA.”

The movement toward elimination is heading mainstream as more and more medical associations begin to question the lasting impacts of plastic additives. Last year’s petition for example is supported by 11 groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics the American Public Health Association and the Center for Food Safety.

Not only is it time that regulators take definitive action to address these ubiquitous chemicals in our environment Birnhaum said consumers also should be voting with their pocketbooks.

“We need to step back and ask the question ‘What do we really need when we know there is a downside?’ Do we really need every tablecloth or new carpet to be totally stain repellent?’” she said.

“Or maybe when we go out to dinner we carry a glass container in our pocketbook as a doggie bag instead of coming home with a Styrofoam or coated paper container” Birnhaum continued.

But their history suggests otherwise.,"Smiling on the outside Super Happy Fun America always claimed to be kidding. But the group’s history suggests otherwise.

They joked and cheered as they boarded the darkened bus in Newton. Some lugged coolers others snapped selfies. As the bus eased onto the highway toward Washington D.C. a man with a thick red beard greeted the giddy passengers. “Say it with me” he bellowed into a microphone like a tour guide rallying new customers. “Super Happy Fun America!” Pictured above clockwise from top left: Suzanne Ianni Mark Sahady Brandon Navom Samson Racioppi John Hugo and Kyle Chapman. (John Hancock/Globe Staff) In a day’s time some on board would decide to join a throng surging toward the Capitol and the violent insurrection erupting there. At least two would be arrested and charged with breaching the building. But all that was still to come. For now the riders were calm. Cynthia Maloney a doula from Watertown who was on the bus described “people talking singing ... it was super happy fun people on the bus.” That is how the group likes to present itself. Super Happy Fun America a Massachusetts organization that has staged protests at the State House hosted the so-called Straight Pride Parade in Boston and then as Congress prepared to certify the election of Joe Biden chartered five buses to ferry anyone with $75 to Washington had long painted itself as an advocacy organization with a whimsical side — and a yellow smiley face as its logo. But researchers who study the far right and have tracked Super Happy Fun America’s rise say the group’s jocular exterior hides a disturbing truth: For some it serves as a gateway into the far right offering people a socially acceptable entry point into extremism. Supporters of President Trump including Super Fun Happy America's Suzanne Ianni (in blue jacket) and Mark Sahady protested inside the US Capitol on Jan. 6. The crowd breached security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the 2020 presidential election electoral vote certification. (Roberto Schmidt/AFP) The group’s lionization of traditional gender roles and its stream of jokey press releases with made-up claims — announcing for example that Brad Pitt would be a mascot of its Straight Pride Parade or that a new SHFA orchestra would celebrate straight contributions to music — have helped normalize radical ideas these experts say. “There are mainstream Trump supporters on one side of the far right and there are explicit Neo-Nazis and white nationalists on the other side” said Ben Lorber a research analyst with the progressive think tank Political Research Associates. “Super Happy Fun America is one of these groups that’s perfectly built to allow those two sides to come together.” The group’s leaders said that the group is conservative but has nothing to do with the far right and denied that it provides an entry into extremism. “We fight to preserve our Constitution. We’re opposed to the gender madness movement. And we defend our country against the cultural marxist movement” said John Hugo Super Happy Fun America’s president in an interview with the Globe. He added that it was “super anti-Nazi.”

Super Happy Fun America was led by Sahady and Racioppi who were active with Resist Marxism and Hugo a Republican who had recently been backed by the organization in a losing campaign to represent the Fifth Congressional District. The new group relied more strongly on the claim that they were just kidding Exoo said. By mixing irony and parody with authentic transphobia and antigay fervor the group created a protective chaos around their communications. “There is such a mixture of ... outrageous claims that are clearly trolling and some that might actually be true or serious it is difficult to distinguish” said Gianluca Stringhini a professor at Boston University who studies malicious activity on the internet. The joking surface nature of the group’s outreach made it seem nonthreatening while attracting a broad range of supporters according to Lorber from those frustrated by “political correctness” to straight-up white supremacists. A marcher (left) confronted a counterprotester during the Straight Pride Parade in Boston on Aug. 31 2019. (Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff) Having successfully used perceived grievances to attract attention and broaden its audience in the past the group now actively sought out rejection and capitalized on it. The group submitted an application to fly a straight pride flag at Boston City Hall and then filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination when the city declined. Super Happy Fun America’s organizers soon announced plans for a Straight Pride Parade in a manifesto that cited the city’s rejection. The parade plans went viral and generated intense controversy and ultimately international media attention. With a spotlight on the group painted its opponents as people who couldn’t take a joke. “These extremely grumpy bigots collectively call themselves Antifa which stands for Anti-fun as they despise all fun and happiness” Super Happy Fun America wrote on its website. “This serves as further proof of our sincerely held belief that Straight people are an oppressed majority.” Once again organizers got the spectacle they craved. At the August 2019 parade that wound from the Back Bay to downtown thousands of protesters turned out in opposition. If the notion of straight pride served as an effective way to hook the media and alienate outsiders at the same time Super Happy Fun America organizers stumbled across a potentially even more potent lightning rod in the spring of 2020: coronavirus restrictions. Such restrictions had struck a nerve with Ianni a Natick Town Meeting member who occasionally wrote an opinion column in her local newspaper. She had been agitated for years about hot-button issues that also motivated Super Happy Fun America writing in a 2019 letter to the editor that those who would benefit from gender-neutral driver’s licenses are “a subset of mentally ill people.” But last spring Ianni’s focus shifted to coronavirus restrictions. She wanted Governor Charlie Baker to let dog groomers resume work she wrote in a letter and she demonstrated in favor of churches continuing to gather large crowds. As tensions over the pandemic restrictions grew Super Happy Fun America offered an outlet for the grievances of Ianni and others like her. In May a large crowd gathered outside the State House for a rally against such restrictions that featured Hugo. Ianni filmed the scene on her cellphone as Sahady Racioppi and Navom stood nearby. Supporters and counter demonstrators gathered at the Massachusetts State House for a rally sponsored by Super Happy Fun America against restrictions during the pandemic last May. John Hugo (center in tricorn hat) addressed the crowd saying “It is time for insurrection.” (Barry Chin/Globe Staff) “My fellow Americans it is time to rise up. It is time for insurrection” Hugo wearing his signature tricorn hat told the crowd. “All around our country we’ve seen governors ignoring legislatures and even the Constitution of the United States and ruling by decree.” Minutes later a man in the crowd yelled “Storm the State House!” Nothing like that happened but the rhetoric was a harbinger of the unrest to come. Despite leaders’ repeated claims that they had nothing to do with the far right local neo-Nazis kept showing up to the group’s events. Neo-Nazis have been photographed at Super Happy Fun America events in 2019 and 2020 though the group’s leaders said they are not welcome.

“We get held responsible for every single person who we’ve ever taken a picture with who’s ever come to our event” said Navom in an interview. “We don’t ask that every person submit a full resume or bio before they come to our rally ... if anyone displays any hate symbols at our rally they will be kicked out and forever banned.” The Globe reported in July that Anthony Petruccelli a Lynn man with a swastika tattooed on his calf was at a June Super Happy Fun America rally at the State House where a small group of men wore “Nationalist Social Club” T-shirts representing a neo-Nazi group. (Petruccelli now denies that he is the man photographed at that rally and says he does not remember if he attended.) Some flew a flag with a Nazi symbol; one wore a Confederate flag T-shirt. Super Happy Fun America called the event a “Restore Sanity” rally to support law enforcement and criticize Black Lives Matter demonstrations. At that rally organizers publicly denounced the white supremacists. It remains an uneasy relationship. “They don’t want that negative attention that’s going to be associated with white supremacists” said Magyarics of the ADL. But all along the group had offered a big tent allowing far-right white supremacists and more mainstream conservatives to mingle at large public rallies. The Trump rally in Washington held a similar promise. Suzanne Ianni and Mark Sahady along with other Donald Trump supporters marched toward the Capitol Building on Jan. 6. (Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images) On Jan. 4 Sahady posted a tweet: “Jan 6- Washington DC- it begins.” Two days later Sahady and Ianni joined hundreds of others who broke into the Capitol building. The Super Happy Fun America buses returned to Newton that night. Both Sahady and Ianni are facing federal trespassing and disorderly conduct charges stemming from the Capitol riot. Even with two prominent figures being prosecuted Super Happy Fun America seems unlikely to disappear. The group never measured its success by the crowd size of its supporters; any audience even an unfriendly one could keep it going. “It changes nothing. We move forward as an organization” Super Happy Fun America tweeted on Inauguration Day. “You don’t get rid of us that easily. Have a nice day.”

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

One year later a former executive at ABC radio gave an opinionated but little-known talk-radio host from Sacramento a nationally syndicated show. This contravened accepted practice; most nationally known radio hosts were bland and inoffensive interviewers the better not to alienate a range of listeners.

Rush Limbaugh was the opposite. His shows rarely had guests or more than a few brief pre-screened callers—the better to let him expound for hours on end on the ills of modern American society most of which were the fault of liberals and the left. His political view was Manichean: easy to understand and engagingly delivered. He made no effort to credit opposing views; he—and by extension his listeners—were defenders of all that was good about America while the liberalism of Democrats as he put it “is a scourge. It destroys the human spirit. It destroys prosperity.” He built this simple format into one of the most popular radio programmes in America attracting millions of listeners and inspiring scores of imitators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcGhpbGx5eWltYnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvbG9va2luZy1iYWNrLWF0LXRoZS10aW1iZXItdG93ZXJzLWluLWNlbnRlci1jaXR5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Examining Timber Towers a Visionary Concept for Wood-Framed High-Rises Suggested for Center City,"In 2018 architecture firm Hickok Cole published a design concept for Timber Towers a trio of mixed-use high-rises that would use wood as the principal structural material. The concept which won an honorable mention in the SKYHIVE Skyscraper Challenge was designed to span an entire block in Center City to the northwest of the Comcast Technology Center. According to the architects the 1.9-million-square-foot plan would use 2075125 cubic feet of wood products “easily replenished by North American forests in less than three hours” and sequester 80775 US tons of carbon dioxide within the structure resulting in emissions savings are the equivalent those produced by 12073 cars within one year.

Rather than an actual proposal Timber Towers is a concept meant to showcase an innovative type of construction. Unlike virtually all high-rises built up to now which have a steel concrete or a composite structure the buildings would use cross-laminated timber technology to create structures composed of thick lumber members. The beams and the floors would also be made completely out of wood while the glass exterior would feature glass thick lumber cross-bracing.

The plan would include 1300871 square feet of office space 102642 square feet of condo/co-working space 78930 square feet of educational space 31330 square feet of office amenity space and 29188 square feet of retail. The residential tower would house 289 rental units.

The tallest tower appears to be in the 800-foot range. If built the project would have an incredible impact both on the skyline and on the construction market. And though the towers would awkwardly block the Comcast Technology Center from view when seen from the Philadelphia Museum of Art and would arguably throw off the appearance of the skyline from certain view corridors the buildings step up toward the skyline core as a pleasant gesture that builds up to the skyline’s massing.

No completion date is available as the design is a purely hypothetical project that as far as we know is not considered for actual construction.

The problems were especially acute at hospitals. One in Austin was forced to move some of its most critically ill patients to another building when its faucets ran nearly dry. Another in Houston had to haul in water on trucks to flush toilets.

But for many of the state’s residents stuck at home the emergency meant boiling the tap water that trickled through their faucets scouring stores for bottled water or boiling icicles and dirty snow on their stoves.

For others it meant no water at all.

Jessica covers the good the bad and the ugly when it comes to big global companies and their impact in Switzerland and abroad. She’s always looking for a Swiss connection with her native San Francisco and will happily discuss why her hometown has produced some of the greatest innovations but can’t seem to solve its housing crisis.

Nestlé grabbed its chance this week when it sold its US and Canadian bottled water brands to a private equity firm for $4.3 billion.

The division has been under constant attack from communities in the US that argue the Swiss food giant is draining local water sources and profiting handsomelyExternal link from it. The rise in resentment against plastic bottles littering the oceans has dented the popularity of bottled water in general. The company sold its water business in Brazil in 2018 amid similar criticism.

With the bottled water heydays over creating paltry growth prospects for the division the US sale was probably more of a relief than a loss.

Novartis wants to make their drugs available to everyone who needs them.

One way is introducing budget alternatives for some drugs based on people’s ability to pay. Public health activists argue that the problems of excessive pricing won’t go away until there is transparency.

The Swiss pharma giant made other headlines in the past few weeks. It signed a deal to help Pfizer/BioNtech manufacture its RNA vaccine and has also made a hefty deal on antibiotics with GSK.

Southern cities slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Busted water pipes ruptured by record-low temperatures created shortages of clean drinking water shut down the Memphis airport on Friday and left hospitals struggling to maintain sanitary conditions.

In Texas 7 million people—a quarter of the population of the nation's second-largest state—were under orders to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260000 homes and businesses in the Tennessee county that includes Memphis were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and pumping station problems. Restaurants that can't do so or don't have bottled water were ordered to close. And water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights.

In Jackson Mississippi most of the city of about 161000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

He said the city's water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.

""We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system"" said Lumumba.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking but residents had to pick it up leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn't been able to go to the pharmacy.

""People are in dire need here"" Thomas said.

Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a half hours after arriving.

""We need water the stores all are out. I don't see what choice we have"" Davis said.

The water woes were the latest misery for people across the South who went without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week forcing rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.

Texas electrical grid operators said electricity transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity to warm up home—buckling the state's power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.

Smaller outages remained but Bill Magness president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas said the grid now can provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

Since then American settlers have robbed and exploited tribal lands cared for and held sacred for generations by hundreds of American Indian tribes. As local communities continue to acknowledge that history and what lessons can be learned from Indigenous people in terms of agriculture or conservation? Have their views on land ownership been misunderstood and disrespected?

KCRW’s Jonathan Bastian talks with Mishuana Goeman Professor of Gender Studies and American Indian Studies at UCLA and Special Advisor to the Chancellor on Native American and Indigenous Affairs.

The following interview excerpts have been abbreviated and edited for clarity.

KCRW: How do we think about land ownership or territories from the perspective of Indigenous cultures in the United States or from the tribe from which you descend?

Mishuana Goeman: “First I'll begin in indigenous protocols which is to introduce myself as Mishuana Goeman Tonawanda Band of Seneca what people now know as Western New York but I'm part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy which is the oldest democracy in the world and expands well into Canada and at one point went all the way down to Pennsylvania. I speak to you today from Tonawanda which is the land of Gabrielino Tongva and at UCLA that's where I work and live and we acknowledge the Tongva daily there.”

Thank you for sharing that. And so how do we start the conversation about tribal lands?

Goeman: “We start with that recognition that I just did. But we need to acknowledge that there's a lot of misconceptions about Indians in land and a lot of my work focuses around this. There's this common misconception that Indians didn't own land is something that stems from our American political roots but not that of Indigenous peoples. We actually did have territories we had marketplaces we had meeting places we shared pieces of land that were connected we had hunting spots and fishing spots. And of course the ways that native people think about the land varies from tribe to tribe and there's over 574 recognized tribes in the United States right now and there's many many more unrecognized tribes especially in California where I'm speaking from. Because California came in late into the domestic space of the nation it resulted in loss treaties and lost lands so the California genocide was really intense in terms of the land grab that happened after California became part of the US in the 1850s.

So there's a particular way that different people think of different lands. In Los Angeles for instance the Tongva organized themselves by various villages because the land was rich with food and resources etc. Where I am from we had larger organized villages and that was because it took a lot of people to work the land and to gather and hunt and it was necessary to live together in larger communities. So in some ways the land kind of defines how we interact as people with the land. There's a particular element that influences also where people live or that can inform their aesthetics it can inform the arts it can inform their songs and informs their languages.

The tie between languages and land is really where you get this deep knowledge what we call traditional ecological knowledge of how we can live in reciprocity with the land and with a certain group of people. But again it depends on where the tribe is located. Where I am from on the East Coast we organize our communities by clans and those clans are passed down through the mother and those clans are deeply tied to the land in how they are named.”

“There's this common misconception that Indians didn't own land is something that stems from our American political roots but not that of Indigenous peoples.” — Mishuana Goeman

Can you talk about the notion of land as being sacred and what that means for certain tribes?

Goeman: “I think of the work that was done in the 1970s around the environmental movement or even today there's a kind of nostalgic approach that can happen between Indians and land. That all Indians think all land is sacred and that's kind of a romanticization in many ways. It was a lot of work to learn how to live off the land that the creator gave you. There was a lot of scientific knowledge that was passed down from generation to generation in order to learn how to farm particular plots of land.

There's a great seed sovereignty movement now that is maintaining some of those traditions and these seed sovereignty projects will save us all in terms of climate change because native people understand the changing climate over a longer duration of time. It's relatively recently that western forms of science have even seen all forms of land and water as connected whereas for many native people it was the very philosophy of understanding how land operates.

So yes we have sacred spaces but I think all land is sacred and all lands should be lived with in reciprocity. There's no divisions and that's where we're some people particularly in federal Indian law where things get parsed out it's not like you can put a border around a sacred space and it won't be affected. Air connects us all for instance the wind connects us all water in the aquifers are connected in these large living ecosystems. This is knowledge that is embedded often in how native people conceive of farming or conceive of living in their particular spaces. You can see it in the artwork you can see it in all kinds of practices organized around land and water as an interconnected space.”

Wright State University (WSU) senior Hannah Davis is majoring in both financial services and accounting. Davis has six years of experience in the field already at the age of 21 several years ahead of others who are starting their internships now.

Financial services and accounting

According to Davis they decided to major in financial services because they want to help people and make sure that they are ready for whatever life throws at them.

Davis started interning at Ameriprise Financial when they were a sophomore in high school.

“It was a great opportunity to learn about all the business at such a young age. I just realized that through it you almost create this large family. You have the people you work with but you also have hundreds of clients that just make every day worth going to work” Davis said.

Once Davis joined WSU they took on a double major of financial services and accounting. Because there were only a few extra classes to take they ended up doing both.

WSU

Both of Davis’s parents are WSU alumni. Davis along with her twin sister Tina would go to WSU basketball games growing up and knew that WSU was the place for them.

“I have absolutely loved my experience here so I’m glad I came to Wright State” Davis said.

Davis is set to graduate in the spring and claims it is one of their proudest accomplishments.

Series 7 and series 66

Davis has completed their series seven and series 66 licensing something that no undergraduate is expected to achieve.

According to Davis the series seven is a federal license to be a broker it involves stocks and bonds. Series 66 is the state version of a broker.

Davis intends to become a private wealth advisor in the future. Because Davis has six years of experience already the only steps to take to achieve their goal is to become a paraplanner which is a step below an advisor.

Online learning

Online learning has changed senior year for Davis.

“In some ways it’s made me more independent. Because of online learning I’ve been able to take more steps forward in my career just because it has given me more flexibility… But in financial services we have to be able to understand people to make our businesses work and we’re missing out on that aspect right now” said Davis.

Though Davis has had to change how they approach their college education one thing stays the same for them.

“I always want to help people. I want to go above and beyond to make sure everyone around me is taken care of. That’s what inspires me the most to be helpful” said Davis.",,,,,,,,,

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

PARLER INTERIM CEO SAYS TRUMP BIDEN WELCOME ON PLATFORM

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

GOOGLE TO EVALUATE EXECUTIVES ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Mr. Biden has signaled that he supports rescinding the broad legal immunity that tech firms currently enjoy for information carried over their networks.

As the Biden administration settles in tech companies are awaiting key picks for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division head. The appointments could determine how aggressively the government handles existing investigations or bringing about new ones advisers to the companies said.

The Journal's analysis is based on the latest Federal Election Commission data covering the 2020 election cycle for Mr. Biden's campaign two joint fundraising committees and individual donations to those committees made through the online donation platform ActBlue. The Journal examined campaign-finance data to compile a list of companies whose employees donated the most money.

The analysis relied on a standardized version of the self-reported employer information on each donation and should be treated as an estimate because some of the public records are incomplete or flawed.

FACEBOOK TO EXPAND EFFORT TO COMBAT CLIMATE MISINFORMATION LABEL POSTS

Because online donation platforms that itemize even the smallest contribution weren't as widely used in 2016 and 2012 data for previous years include information only on donors who gave more than $200 to a campaign.

About two-thirds of the money in presidential races is donated to candidates from individuals who could give up to $2800 to a candidate for the recent election. Those who donate $200 or more are required to disclose the names of their employers.

While corporations are prohibited from making financial donations to candidates for national office many companies operate political-action committees or PACs which are employee-funded accounts that companies use to donate money to favored candidates. Relatively little money in presidential elections comes from corporate PACs. Labor unions spend millions of dollars each election to support Democratic candidates.

Technology employees made donations to other political entities that worked to elect Mr. Biden and other Democrats including Future Forward USA PAC which spent millions of dollars on the 2020 election.

Mr. Biden's campaign according to the Journal's analysis received $3.7 million from employees of five of the largest Wall Street firms: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. Bank of America Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. In prior elections those firms ranked among the top sources of money for the Democratic presidential candidate records show.

That was less than the total contributed to Mr. Biden by employees of Alphabet who donated $5.3 million making the tech company the No. 1 source of money the Journal analysis shows.

Google employees were the top source of donations to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign and the second-largest source of money for Mr. Obama's 2012 race.

Employees of Amazon contributed a total of $2.8 million to Mr. Biden's campaign. Amazon was the third-largest source of money among companies to Mr. Biden in the election. The company hadn't been a big source of campaign money for prior Democratic candidates records show.

Microsoft employees have long been a top source of money for Democratic presidential candidates. Microsoft employees donated $3.2 million to Mr. Biden in the election.

Facebook employees have emerged as a top source of money donating $1.9 million to his campaign records show.

In 2007 Apple unveiled the iPhone. Apple didn't invent the smartphone — companies like Palm and Blackberry had been selling them for years. But the iPhone introduced a totally new way to interact with computers. The always-on internet connectivity finger-friendly touch screen and interface based around clickable app icons all seem commonplace now. But at the time the whole package felt revolutionary. The smartphone was a seismic shift for the technology industry creating entirely new business models — apps became $100 billion companies -- while replacing everything from digital cameras to in-car GPS systems. But smartphone sales have dropped two calendar years straight for the first time according to Gartner. Smartphones are old news. The tech industry's next bet is a series of technologies usually called augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality. The vision usually involves some kind of computer worn in front of the user's eyes.

watch now

Users will still be able to see most of the real world in front of them — unlike virtual reality which completely immerses the user in a computer-generated fantasyland augmented reality layers computer-generated text and images on top of reality. Industry watchers and participants think that Apple has a good chance to validate and revolutionize AR like it did with smartphones. Apple has been prototyping headsets for years and recent reports from The Information and Bloomberg suggest that Apple could release a headset as early as 2022 that could cost as much as $3000. But Apple's not the only company working on these products. All the big tech players — Microsoft Google Facebook and Amazon — are in the game as well. Futurists and screenwriters have conjured blue-sky visions of what could happen with advanced computer glasses — one episode of the dystopian anthology ""Black Mirror"" explored a world where people could ""block"" certain people out of their view. More positive visions imagine having important information coming directly into your view exactly when you want it. Today the most common use cases are much more mundane including smartphone-based games and apps like Pokemon Go or Apple's Ruler app which use the phone's screen and camera rather than relying on glasses or another set of screens sitting on your face. The few companies who are actively producing AR glasses are mostly focused on work scenarios like manufacturing and medicine. ""That's where we now sit in spatial computing's lifecycle. It's not the revolutionary platform shift touted circa-2016"" said Mike Boland technology analyst and founder of ARtillery Intelligence in a recent report. ""It's not a silver bullet for everything we do in life and work as once hyped. But it will be transformative in narrower ways and within a targeted set of use cases and verticals."" Here's what the biggest companies in tech are doing to try and make augmented reality the next big thing:

Apple

Apple's generation-defining success with the iPhone has made it the company to watch in augmented reality -- even though the company has never confirmed it is working on a headset glasses or any other kind of head-worn computer. Boland says that if Apple were to release a pair of AR glasses it could ""determine the fate of the AR industry"" given the company's track record of popularizing new technologies. A report from Bloomberg last month suggested Apple's first AR product could be out as early as next year. Its first shot will reportedly a battery-powered headset that's primarily designed for virtual reality but with on-board cameras to enable augmented reality as well. The report says this device could cost thousands of dollars and be available only in low volumes -- more typical of a test platform for software developers than the mass-market products Apple usually releases. Eventually Apple could take lessons it learns from the virtual reality headset and apply it to a pair of lightweight AR glasses with transparent displays. But according to Bloomberg that project still faces additional work on technical issues such as miniaturization and lens technology. Display technology is another limiting factors for augmented reality. The transparent displays currently on the market have a limited field of view in which they can display graphics are often not bright enough for daylight use and generally could be better suited for all-day wear. Apple's working on solving this problem too according to a report in Nikkei Asia. The newspaper says that Apple is working with TSMC its primary processor manufacturer to develop a new kind of augmented reality display that's printed directly on wafers or the base layer for chips. If Apple does eventually reveal a big leap forward in AR display technology -- especially if the technology is developed and owned by Apple instead of a supplier -- Apple could find itself with multi-year head-start in augmented reality as it did when the iPhone vaulted it to the head of the smartphone industry. Of course that's assuming that there's software worth using when the headset comes out. But Apple has already laid the groundwork for a rich software library. In 2017 Apple released software called ARKit which includes tools for software makers to determine how far away an object or wall is if the phone is moving or identify limbs in a human body among other functions. Companies like Ikea Target and Amazon have already used ARKit mostly for placing virtual furniture in a room to see if it fits. Warby Parker uses it to enable virtual glasses try-ons through its app. Snap uses new iPhone 3D sensors to improve its face-shifting lenses which advertisers can purchase. But so far few ARKit apps have found a wider audience. Apple is also adding hardware to its iPhones that hint at a headset-based future. High-end iPhones released in 2020 include advanced Lidar sensors embedded in their camera. These sensors can measure how far away objects are and are currently used to execute fun filters and photo effects. But when paired with an advanced headset their use could be more profound. Apple is considering using lidar sensors on its headset according to The Information. One way to look at Apple's investment in the technology is to look at the companies it's bought in the field. It's bought a company that builds transparent optics a headset maker and companies that make software and content for augmented and virtual reality including Akonia Holographics Vrvana Metaio Emotient Flyby Media Spaces and NextVR.

Google was the first major technology company to release a head-worn computer when it introduced Google Glass in 2013. It cost $1500 at the time and was explicitly targeted at people in the computer industry and early adopters which Google called ""explorers."" Google's approach was significantly lighter and simpler than what's come since. Google Glass did not attempt to use advanced processing to integrate computer graphics into the real world. Instead it was equipped with a camera and had a little transparent display with relatively low resolution on the right temple. That display was used to project small bits of information into the user's field of vision -- sort of like an Apple Watch or smartwatch on the user's face. But Google Glass was also a lightning rod for criticism -- it had a built-in video camera and people who weren't wearing it felt like they were being watched. One wearer said she was assaulted outside a San Francisco bar in 2014 for wearing the glasses. Google paused Glass in 2015 and rejiggered it for business users. Last year it started selling Google Glass for $999 per unit through some of its hardware resellers. One key application for Glass is Augmedix which uses the headset's camera to cut down on the time doctors spend on busywork. The Glass camera streams an interaction with patients to ""scribes"" hired by the company who write down the important details and enter them into the patient record. Last year Google acquired North a Canadian company making a pair of lightweight $1000 smartglasses.

Microsoft

Microsoft HoloLens 2 Microsoft

Microsoft announced its augmented reality headset Hololens in 2015 and released the first version in 2016. It's now on its second version which costs $3500. It's a niche device targeted for business sales. (Microsoft's tagline: ""Work smarter with mixed reality."") On its website Microsoft touts manufacturing retail and healthcare as primary use cases. In factories the headset can inform workers about how to fix or operate a complicated machine. Retailers instead of having costly display items or large amounts of inventory can virtually display their goods to customers Microsoft suggests. Microsoft's store currently has 343 HoloLens apps. None are household names and many are simple demos that display graphics like a birthday cake or fireworks. Microsoft has invested heavily in these kind of technologies purchasing AltspaceVR a social network for virtual reality in 2018. Before it launched Hololens it paid $150 million for intellectual property from a smartglasses pioneer. It doesn't break out Hololens sales or revenue.

Facebook

Facebook announced it will begin using Project Aria research glasses to collect video audio eye-tracking and location data from public spaces to inform its development of smart glasses. Facebook

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks the most in public about his hopes for augmented reality. Last year he said ""While I expect phones to still be our primary devices through most of this decade at some point in the 2020s we will get breakthrough augmented reality glasses that will redefine our relationship with technology."" Facebook's enthusiasm for augmented reality is driven in part by its dependence on smartphone platforms from other vendors today. In particular Facebook has been balking at Apple's control over the iPhone for years and the fight has escalated recently as Apple is planning technical changes to the iPhone software that will hurt Facebook's main moneymaker mobile advertising. If Facebook creates the next big platform then it will set the rules. Zuckerberg is also predicting massive societal change stemming from augmented reality: ""Imagine if you could live anywhere you chose and access any job anywhere else."" Facebook is already a leader in virtual reality augmented reality's cousin. It bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014 a move that signaled the start of massive investment in these technologies. The latest Oculus headset includes cameras costs $300 and sold 1 million units in December according to an estimate from SuperData. With cameras mounted on the front and powerful processing virtual reality headsets can approximate augmented reality by displaying a real-time feed of the outside world. This feature is called ""passthrough"" on recent Oculus headsets and it could be Apple's initial approach as well. The company is also working on lightweight AR glasses and hopes to launch a product this year in partnership with Luxottica the sunglasses giant CNBC previously reported. Facebook is also working on ""Project Aria"" which is a research-oriented pair of computer glasses that don't have advanced AR displays but can record video audio track the user's eyes and access location data.

Apple's fight with Epic Games is apparently dragging other video game companies into its net.

A joint court letter filed on Thursday and spotted by Ars Technica reveals Apple has been trying to subpoena Valve the company behind the hugely popular online game store Steam for information.

Apple has been engaged in a legal battle with Epic Games the studio behind the wildly popular ""Fortnite"" since August. The fight centers around Epic Games' refusal to comply with Apple's App Store rules on in-app payments in its iOS version of ""Fortnite.""

Apple requires app developers to use its own payment system which levies an automatic 30% tax on in-app purchases. Epic Games claims this is anti-competitive and in August decided to implement its own payment system after which Apple kicked ""Fortnite"" off the App Store.

Epic Games subsequently sued Apple and the two companies have been battling it out ever since — with Apple CEO Tim Cook scheduled to give a seven-hour deposition ahead of the case going to court in May. Epic Games has kept up the pressure this week filing an antitrust complaint with the EU.

Valve is not directly involved in the legal fight between the two companies. Apple said it is asking for documents showing Valve's yearly sales and revenues as well as information about each app on Steam including its pricing as a way of gaining an understanding of the market Epic Games operates in.

Apple complains in its letter that Valve has resisted complying with some of its requests for information and that when it has handed over information it's been heavily redacted.

Valve claims Apple is asking for too much information given Valve is not a concerned party in its fight with Epic Games and it is not a mobile platform. More broadly Valve is also claiming that because it's a distributor of PC games the information it can provide is largely irrelevant to the fight between Apple and Epic Games.

""Valve does not make or sell phones tablets or video games for mobile devices or otherwise compete in the mobile market"" it says in the letter. It added that Apple's requests would impose an ""extraordinary burden"" on Valve to collect all the data Apple wants.

""The extensive and highly confidential information Apple demands about a subset of the PC games available on Steam does not show the size or parameters of the relevant market and would be massively burdensome to pull together"" Valve said in its letter.

Apple argues that Valve should be compelled to offer the information because Samsung complied with similar requests. Valve's counter-argument is that Samsung is a public company so it is used to keeping records of that kind of information which could be produced much more quickly and easily.

""Somehow in a dispute over mobile apps a maker of PC games that does not compete in the mobile market or sell 'apps' is being portrayed as a key figure.

This article explains adding additional administrator accounts or promoting existing users in macOS 10.15 (Catalina) but the procedure is nearly identical in older versions.

About Administrator Accounts

An administrator account has the same basic capabilities as a standard user account including its own Home folder desktop backgrounds preferences Music bookmarks Messages accounts Address Book/Contacts and other account features. Setting an administrator account apart is its elevated privilege levels. Administrators can change system preferences that control how the Mac works and feels install software and perform many special tasks that standard user accounts cannot perform.

Your Mac computer needs only one administrator account but allowing one or two other trusted people to have administrative privileges is a straightforward process.

Creating a New Administrator Account

You'll need to be logged in as an administrator to create or edit user accounts. You created an administrator account when you first set up your Mac. Then:

Launch System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Applications folder. Click Users & Groups. Click the lock icon and enter your password. Click OK. Click the plus (+) button located below the list of user accounts. Select Administrator from the drop-down menu of account types. Enter the requested information: the new account holder's full name account name password and password hint. Click the key next to Password to have the Password Assistant generate a password for you. Click Create User.

A new Home folder will be created using the account’s short name and a randomly chosen icon to represent the user. You can change the user icon at any time by clicking the icon and selecting a new one from the dropdown list of images.

Repeat the above process to create additional administrator user accounts. When you’ve finished creating accounts click the lock icon in the bottom left corner of the Users & Groups pane to prevent others from making changes.

Promote an Existing Standard User to Administrator

You also can promote a standard user account to an administrator account. Open Users & Groups as above log in to your Administrator account and select the account you wish to change. Place a checkmark next to Allow user to administer this computer."

Nevertheless while their attenuation achieves impressive figures the challenge of accomplishing a low loss single-mode (SM) and polarization-maintaining HCPCF perseveres.

In a new paper published in Light: Science & Applications a team of scientists led by Professor Fetah Benabid from the University of Limoges France and in collaboration of the University of Modena Italy and the company GLOphotonics proposed and fabricated a new IC-HCPCF the hybrid Kagome-tubular lattice (HKT) HCPCF which combines effective single-mode operation and ultralow loss. The cladding of the HKT HCPCF exhibits an inner cladding made of six untouching tubes and a Kagome outer cladding which are linked by thin connecting tubes. The inner cladding guarantees an effective single-mode operation by providing coupling between the LP11-like modes guided in the core (usually the foremost contaminating higher-order modes to the fiber modal content) to the fundamental mode of the cladding tubes. In turn the Kagome outer cladding significantly reduces the confinement loss.

""We endeavored to fabricate such a fiber and experimentally achieved a minimum transmission loss of 1.6 dB/km at 1050 nm. Moreover we assessed the fiber modal content and attained a record high-order modes extinction ratio of 47 dB in a 10 m-long fiber"" the researchers explain.

""The fiber single-mode operation is remarkably robust. We tested the fiber under motion and inspected the fiber modal content while misaligning the input coupling beam. We observed higher-order modes extinction ratios as high as 24.7 dB even when the coupling beam was severely misaligned (input beam shifted by 10 μm from its optimum position).""

Additionally Prof. Benabid forecasts that ""further improvements on the experimental fiber structure such as having better control on the shapes and sizes of the connecting tubes between the tubular and Kagome lattices are expected to entail loss reduction by more than one order of magnitude.""

""In the manuscript we delved into the fiber design rationale and extensively studied the effect of associating two IC claddings in the new HKT HCPCF. Indeed the IC principles apprise the main design elements which allow attaining ultralow loss and tailoring the fiber properties for specific applications. Additionally they inform the great freedom in designing HCPCFs and make us confident that by judicious choice of the cladding structure and by ingenious fabrication methods this fiber will be elected as protagonist of the next transformative developments in HCPCF technology"" says Prof. Benabid.

The Atlanta-based owner of ApartmentGuide.com Rent.com and Rentals.com is set to be acquired in a cash deal worth $608 million.

The operational details of the transaction are expected to be released in the near-term. The deal is subject to certain customary closing conditions which include antitrust approval and approval from a bankruptcy court. RentPath’s rental listings on Redfin.com are expected be integrated in late 2022.

With the acquisition Redfin (RDFN) will join together a site for buying a home with a site for renting a home creating more options for individuals seeking a home.

Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said “RentPath has more than 20000 apartment buildings on its rental websites and grew its traffic more than 25% last year.” (See Redfin stock analysis on TipRanks)

“We can almost double that audience as one in five of Redfin.com’s 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent. Together with RentPath we can create an online destination for every North American to find a home” he added.

Following the deal Stifel Nicolaus analyst John Egbert reiterated a Hold rating and a price target of $65 (33% downside potential) on the stock. The analyst views “the deal favorably as it effectively broadens Redfin’s suite of real estate services to all U.S. consumers for a reasonable cost for the assets acquired.”

The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 3 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $74.40 implies 23% downside potential to current levels. Shares have already jumped almost 41% so far this year.

Redfin scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

It is safe to assume that CEOs do glance at their share price from time to time. Lando too. And if he did it at any time over the past year he’d have reason to be pleased. Over the past 12 months while the world was battling Covid-19 SolarEdge stock prices multiplied more than threefold climbing from $100 per share last January to $330 this week.

“When we first hit a billion dollars in annual sales it was definitely a feeling of accomplishment” says Lando. “When you reach such a sum you start thinking about how to push on and reach $2 billion in sales. Today we’re already at around $1.5 billion.”

“That is not on the table at all. Our desire intent and activity is focused on expanding the company into even more avenues in the field of green and renewable energy. SolarEdge is a horse you can ride into the sunset and that’s precisely what we aim to do.”

Guy Still Appears in my Dreams Telling me What to Do

The current produced by photovoltaic cells is a direct current. You need an inverter to turn it into the alternating current that matches the electricity grid. That was the first thing that SolarEdge developed. The company was founded in 2006 by five partners and it took them three years to develop their first product. When it was ready it was no longer just an inverter but a tool that enabled remote monitoring and optimization of individual solar panels (according to the direction of the sunlight shade and other variables). It was at that stage that Lando joined the company as VP of global sales and within several months SolarEdge landed its first client in Germany.

Since then the company has grown significantly and for the past two years has cornered the market in the inverter sector (according to international research institute IHS). The company’s list of clients and markets is consistently growing as are investments in it. In 2015 it went public in New York and over the past two years through a series of acquisitions has also entered the electricity storage electrical propulsion and uninterruptible power supply markets. It employs 3400 people in its global production and development centers 1800 of them in Israel. It opened its new 14000 square-meter electronics plant in northern Israel just six months ago.

It is impossible however to talk about SolarEdge and its success without mentioning Guy Sella the founder the driving spirit and the CEO of the company until August 2019 when he passed away from cancer of the bowels.

“Guy was a mythical figure” Lando says. “To this day when we do something that he would have opposed we glance at his photo that hangs in the office and say ‘cover his ears for a moment’.”

SolarEdge was largely built in Sella’s image who would have turned 57 next week. He served in the IDF’s elite combat intelligence unit Sayeret Matkal and was injured in the line of duty. He later went on to study industrial management at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology returned to the military where he served in the Intelligence Corp’s technological unit advanced in the ranks was awarded the coveted Israel Defense Prize and after his discharge joined the venture capital industry until he founded SolarEdge together with some of his former army subordinates.

He was also the person who led to the establishment of the new manufacturing facility which was inaugurated on the one year anniversary of his death and named in his honor “Sella 1.” The first thing you see as you enter the factory is a commemoration wall in his honor featuring the words of a song that he wrote and an electronic display that features photos of him and texts that he penned. The new battery plant that SolarEdge is building in South Korea will be named “Sella 2” and “there will be many more Sellas in the future” a senior executive at the company says.

Sella is often remembered for being determined and aggressive a creative figure colorful and tumultuous. One of his signature features was his affection for flip-flops which he would often wear even at formal occasions. “I had big flip-flops to fill” quips Lando with a smile.

“Guy was creative but mostly he was determined. Sometimes we would take a long time deliberating a move but once we had decided on a course we would do it with full force marching to victory clinging to the mission with complete determination and everybody knew where it came from. Even now we often joke amongst ourselves about who Guy visited in a dream and what instructions he gave us.

“But Guy was primarily my friend. We are roughly the same age and so are our children our families spent a lot of time together. Shortly after I joined SolarEdge I was with my daughter at a tennis competition and happened to run into Guy who was there with his daughter. The girls became friends and we’d occasionally travel together for a few days to tennis competitions.

“I spent more accumulated hours with Guy than I did with my wife. We were both a bit older than the others and we discovered a shared curiosity a great appreciation for professionalism which manifested in our interest in sports and biographies — he was a big fan of Winston Churchill and John McCain. We had a tradition during business trips to go out for ice cream at 2 a.m. We’d text one another ‘ice-cream?’and head out.”

You weren’t exactly identical.

“We both had the same haircut” Lando says with a smile indicating his bald head” but we came from different backgrounds and have pretty different characters “I come from a more conservative background not a big adventurer. Guy was more adventurous dynamic creative. Let’s be honest Guy had a much richer and more accomplished past. He was also much more sociable than I am. But still in terms of our curiosity appreciation of professionalism basic perceptions and values when it comes to family and business we were pretty similar.”

He stayed on as CEO and chairman of the company until three days before his death. Did you have a chance to say goodbye to him?

“The two years during which he was sick was a complicated time in many ways. Ten days before the last board meeting he chaired I traveled to the U.S. When I landed in New York I had a message from Guy asking that I get back to him. He told me ‘according to a test I did yesterday — it’s over a matter of weeks. We have to start preparing’.”

What do you say in a moment like that?

“I told him: ‘Guy I love you’ and he answered ‘coming from you I know it is the truth’.”

Did you try to encourage him sow seeds of hope?

“He was a realist a scientist. He knew exactly what was going on what was left in his arsenal he was not one to draw encouragement in his assessment of his condition.

“In the following two weeks he made arrangements for everything on all fronts — both in his personal life and in the company. He spoke about what needed to be done in the future including relaying that ‘it all depends on you’ and he announced that I would be taking on the role of CEO. With an emphasis on ‘announced’ he wasn’t one to ask questions. He asserted.”

How did you start off at the company? When did you first meet him?

“I was at Applied Materials for 16 years running the company’s Israeli division’s business activities. Applied Materials’ core activity is machines that produce semiconductors but at one stage it entered the solar energy field. After it acquired a company in Italy I was assigned to manage it and that was how I was first exposed to the solar energy world in 2008. At the same time SolarEdge had a working product and it was time to figure out how to bring it to market. All of the founders — Yoav Galin Meir Adest Amir Fishelov Lior Handelsman and Guy himself — came from a military background in product development but none had any business experience and I had gotten tired of travelling back and forth to Italy. This all led to a meeting with Guy over a plate of Humus.

In flip-flops.

“Naturally what a question. Afterwards I met with the other founders and in mid 2009 I joined the company to lead SolarEdge’s business activity.”

And then 10 years later you find yourself taking over as CEO. How did you feel about it?

“Some people at the company compared it to Tim Cook and Steve Jobs. Comparing Guy to Jobs may be apt but comparing me to Cook is an exaggeration.”

Lando is carrying on Sella’s path but is also doing some things differently. For example “Guy was amazing at mechanics. Among his list of many attributes he was a gifted mechanic and planner. We have excellent mechanics on the team but it was customary for Guy to make the decisions when it comes to mechanics. To this day when the mechanical team presents a new product and they are unsure on which screw to use things go silent and everyone looks at me. And I tell them ‘guys the days in which the CEO determines which screw to use are over’.”

Did you ever think you would replace him?

“I never coveted his position in any way. I was just planning to be part of a team that builds a substantial Israeli company.”

The renewable energy market has been scorching in recent years alongside the increase in awareness about the gravity of the climate crisis and its catastrophic repercussions. The advance of technological developments that increased efficiency and lowered the cost of solar panels and energy storage facilities have also accelerated activities in the field. The election of Joe Biden to the presidency and the incentives he promised to expedite the shift to renewable energy have contributed to the revolution too. But the industry is still subject to turbulence sometimes coming from unexpected forces. One of those forces who in recent weeks has also shaken up Wall Street is Elon Musk. A month ago the founder of Tesla announced that his electric car company would replace the inverters that it currently purchases from SolarEdge with its own causing the Israeli company’s stock price to dive by nearly 16% in one day.

How does it feel to lose $3 billion in enterprise value in a single day?

“Tesla has been our client for more than a decade and as a result of this decision it will gradually reduce its purchases from us. For our part we will attempt to show it that our products are good and that it is in Tesla’s interest to continue purchasing them. Tesla remains a respectable client but these days it is less substantial in terms of revenues.”

The investors seemed to be spooked by the announcement.

“That’s because the name Tesla carries a lot of weight and it is indeed a significant event but the impact is not that huge. It is only one of 50 concerns that keep me up at night.”

Your stock is currently trading for more than $300 a share. Those kinds of figures strengthen the claim that renewable energy companies’ valuations on Wall Street are bloated and that it’s all a giant bubble.

“We were told similar things when our stock was worth $200 and $250 too. We don’t think in terms of raising the stock value only of raising the company’s value which means more sales more profits and more growth.

“A decade ago when we were looking for companies with a large solar market to operate in there were only 10 now there are 15 or 20. The basic market trends show an increase in solar energy and electric vehicles. These trends are rapidly advancing and irreversible. Quite a few countries are dedicating resources to these fields as part of their post-pandemic exit mechanisms. Sure administrations have an impact but the basic trends are driven by life itself.”

Lando (56) was born to a religious family but now lives a secular lifestyle. He attended a religious high school and was active in a religious youth movement which is how he met his wife who is a psychologist. He was injured in a jeep accident while serving in the Israeli military and later served as an intelligence officer. He adopted his Israeli nationality when he was five years old after his family immigrated from New Jersey and to this day it is an integral part of the company’s business activity which he insists will not seep out of Israel.

SolarEdge is only traded in the U.S. most of your production is carried out overseas what is it that makes the company Israeli?

“All of our corporate management sits here in Israel nearly all of our development takes place here and we currently also have a production line here. But from the start we had the far greater international market in our sights. I’m glad that the Israeli market has woken up to solar energy and it is nice to be playing in our ‘home court’ competing for projects here however our local activity makes up only a fraction of our total activity. We are a green technology company that was born in Israel but has a global orientation.”

Teva Pharmaceuticals also started out that way but is currently very un-Israeli.

“We have no plans of going down that path. We haven’t relocated any Israeli employees. Our U.S. manager is an American the manager in Germany is German the manager in Australia is an Australian and the manager in India is an Indian. Though nowadays they seem more Israeli than I do. They often use the Hebrew words of encouragement ‘Yalla’ and ‘Kadima’ So much so that our U.S. manager calls me up and says ‘Zivi I want to make a Kombina’ (Hebrew for deal). They’ve gone through a process of Israelification. Moreover all the Israeli founders are still involved in the company in a sort of harmony that is rare for a successful 15-year-old company. Guy would always say ‘prediction is always a complicated thing especially when it comes to the future’ in that vein I can assert that our intention is to remain Israeli but I am not in the business of making promises and guarantees.”

What is the financial reasoning behind the decision after 15 years to open a $50 million production facility in Israel at a time that nearly all companies prefer to shift to cheaper production in the east?

“Expanding production in Israel is indeed a slightly unusual decision but beyond the patriotic motivation it is important for the development of new products. We opened the Israeli plant to take advantage of the proximity to the development team. We want to design the manufacturing processes here create the prototypes for new products which can then be easily duplicated by our subcontractors around the world. On the surface it seems like any other large electronics plant but what’s unique about it is its level of automation. That is the way to cope with the high labor costs here which are 10 times higher than what it costs us in Vietnam. Automation also upholds the quality of the product which is meant to last for 25 years otherwise repair costs are huge.”

Growing courtesy of the Koreans Italians and Biden

Over the past two years SolarEdge has carried out three acquisitions that underline its intentions to expand into new fields. In 2018 it acquired Jerusalem-based Gamatronic a 40-year old uninterrupted power supply systems (UPS) manufacturer for $41 million. Later the same year it acquired Korean-based Lithium-ion battery manufacturer Kokam for $88 million and in January 2019 it acquired Italian integrated powertrain technology company SMRE for $77 million.

These acquisitions indicate expansion into new fields. Is that because you’ve exhausted the core market?

“We are the global leaders in inverters for private homes and one of the leaders in commercial rooftop installations but at the moment we are not a major player in the market of large ground-based solar fields so we still have a lot of room to grow in our core market. But the acquisitions also granted us entrance into the electric powertrain and energy storage sectors both of which are fields where we identify significant growth potential. All of these systems have to do with energy conversion whether it’s of electric vehicles solar batteries or UPS networks. They all relate to the technological capabilities that we’ve been developing for the past 15 years.”

So what does your vision actually entail?

“Imagine a neighborhood in which many of the houses operate as power plants. It’s easiest to imagine it in the residential sector because the seeds of it already exist. Our individual homes will function as ‘prosumers’ (both producers and consumers). They will produce their own power their devices will be planned in a way that fully maximizes the energy of the sun and their inner systems will be smart and based on economic considerations meaning they will be able to sell surplus energy they produce to others. It’s a vision that can already be imagined.

“In all the futuristic movies we see these white devices that speak to their owners. We once made an internal company video on that theme in which Amazon’s Alexa wakes you up in the morning saying ‘the water is at the precise temperature you requested and we saved a thousand trees from being chopped down — go take a shower.’ That might be on the extreme end of the vision but it will be difficult to stop.”

How do electric vehicles fit in with the vision?

“Electric vehicles will require charging and in certain conditions it can also provide power to the house. Maybe you’ll charge your car at work and it will function as a backup battery for your home. It will store energy after all and that energy can be converted.”

You can use the energy in vehicles to power homes?

“Absolutely. The battery that we manufactured and which is charged by solar energy is the same one they install in electric vehicles. You can both charge and discharge it. We will provide the inverter and the battery. The inverter is at the core of our technology.”

Will the Administration change in the White House aid in things developing in that direction?

“There is a government initiative up for debate on reducing taxes on the use of renewable energy in battery storage. It hasn’t been approved yet but it may expand the market. Nowadays 10% of private homes have a battery. If that grows to 30% or 40% it would be huge for us.”",,,,,,

BioProducts plant in Decatur were evacuated Sunday afternoon after an anhydrous ammonia leak was detected.

Firefighters with the Decatur Fire Department responded to the scene at 2:50 p.m. to help deal with the leak and ADM said later Sunday there had been no injuries.

At 4:45 p.m. ADM released an emailed statement after being contacted for comment by the Herald & Review. ""This afternoon employees detected an ammonia leak at ADM's BioProducts facility in Decatur"" the statement said.

""The facility was evacuated while authorities assisted in detecting and fixing the leak. No one was injured. We are investigating the cause and working to resume operations.""

Wade Watson a battalion chief with the Decatur Fire Department said Sunday evening that some 15 firefighters worked the incident from roughly 2:30 until 5 p.m. He said the leak which appeared like white steam was contained within a single building but he does not know how much of the gas leaked.

Watson said ADM personnel took the lead in dealing with the incident with firefighters backing them up and acting as their ""decontamination unit"" which meant washing off the employees after they emerged from the leak area.

""Anhydrous is an inhalation hazard and it burns your wet tissues mucous membranes your eyes and it can burn your lungs"" added Watson. ""And when it mixes with water it creates sulphuric acid.""

Watson said water is still effective at neutralizing it however if used in sufficient quantities.

""The ADM building has what is called a deluge system that floods the entire area with water and is able to knock down any vapor cloud"" he said. ""I am not sure if it is an automatic system or if they had to operate it but it was running when we got there.""

Watson said ADM employees had been able to shut down valves connected to large tanks to contain and limit the leakage.

""So what really leaked was what was in the lines"" he added.

Watson said ADM is investigating the cause of the incident and had plant managers and other experts on scene Sunday. He confirmed there were no injuries and the leak was contained within ADM property and presented no danger to the public.

The latest news comes from East Asia where Korean media reported this morning that the country’s current prime minister Chung Sye-kyun has officially joined the social audio app under the username @gyunvely making him among the most senior political leaders worldwide to join the burgeoning app. His account was created on Valentine’s Day (February 14) and was “nominated” by a user using the name of TJ Park (Clubhouse does not have verified profiles).

So far the prime minister has garnered slightly fewer than 500 followers and is following a bit fewer than 200 accounts perhaps indicating the app’s current reach in one of the world’s most mobile and connected digital economies. His Clubhouse bio reads “노란잠바 그 아저씨” or “That Yellow Jacket Guy” a reference to the Korean civil defense uniform worn by politicians in times of crisis (such as throughout the COVID-19 pandemic) and which currently serves — in cartoon form — as Chung’s profile picture.

According to local media reports Chung spoke in a Clubhouse room for over an hour with fellow Democratic Party of Korea member Jung Cheong-rae. In a public Facebook post yesterday the prime minister said that “I heard this [app] is ‘hot’ these days so I tried it as a nighttime walk.”

He further said “I was a little startled by the unexpected questions and reactions but the new experience was enjoyable. I think I’ll participate from time to time in the future.” Elaborating he said “the fact that it’s audio-only and everyone can have a conversation without reserve made me think that it’s a better communication tool than any other social media platform especially since currently we’re living in the age of non-face-to-face communication.”

Discussions in the Clubhouse room included questions asking whether it was really him to more bread-and-butter policy issues like the high price of real estate and physical abuse in the sports world which has dominated headlines in recent weeks in local media.

While Clubhouse has become something of a fixture for techies and every form of hustle culture connoisseur imaginable the app has increasingly made forays into politics that are hardly unknown to other social networks.

Story continues

Miami’s mayor Francis Suarez has been on Clubhouse to sell his city’s potential for the tech industry. San Francisco district attorney Chesa Boudin joined a “debate” on the platform about the future of SF while NYC mayoral aspirant and all around UBI nerd Andrew Yang joined a discussion about … himself. Meanwhile Bitcoin aficionado and itinerant Tesla leader Elon Musk has even proposed bringing Vladimir Putin onto Clubhouse for a live fireside chat.

Yet as the platform expands globally the challenges to its open and free-wheeling if somewhat moderated conversations are coming under closer scrutiny. China has now blocked Clubhouse within its borders after a brief period of uncensored conversation.

As Clubhouse continues to garner mainstream legitimacy and interest questions continue to percolate on the future of the app’s success such as how it will fund creators and continue to thrive once the world opens up after COVID-19.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXRjaC1iYWQtYnVubnktcm9zYWxpYS1zaXp6bGUtMTYyMDQ4MTMxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Bad Bunny and Rosalia Sizzle on 'Saturday Night Live',"Two of Latin music’s biggest young stars Bad Bunny and Rosalia teamed up for a steamy duet on their song “La Noche de Anoche” on “Saturday Night Live” on Feb 20. Rosalia’s appearance was rumored but unannounced and while the two are not known to be an item they nuzzled intimately while performing the song moving their faces closer and closer together as it ended almost kissing — but then pulling away and laughing like a pair of friends putting on an act.

For his second performance Bad Bunny performed “Te Deseo lo Mejor” solo atop an illuminated staircase. The song is from El Último Tour del Mundo one of the Puerto Rican superstar’s three albums released in 2020.

More from Variety

However the show made ample use of its musical guest. Bad Bunny appeared as a talking plant in a hilarious sketch featuring Ego Nwodim and Pete Davidson about lockdown cabin-fever centered on an original hip-hop song called “Loco” and later in another sketch spoofing the sea-shanty trend on TikTok. Watch them all below.

Music was at the center of many elements of Saturday’s episode as it opened with a much buzzed-about sketch featuring Chloe Fineman’s latest stellar impersonation — this time as Britney Spears hosting a talk show where recent controversial characters such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo apologize for their recent widely publicized transgressions. Later a sketch starring host Regé-Jean Page found much of the show’s male cast bonding over Olivia Rodrigo’s smash “Drivers License” and the ballad’s supposed power to rend the hearts of even hardened barflies.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Mais ni ces finitions ni le vent frais qui balayait les rues sous les éclaircies matinales n’ont empêché les curieux de venir faire connaissance avec la place. De l’investir la réhabiter enfin à l’issue d’un vaste chantier.

Le long des allées les bancs de bois sont spacieux et les installations pratiques (poubelles bornes à mégots sacs pour déjections canines) ne manquent pas. Autour cinq espaces de pelouse çà et là ombragés par des arbres jeunes et moins jeunes. Et pour ceindre l’îlot de verdure la vraie innovation urbaine : des axes sud et est entièrement piétonnisés. À voir de jeunes enfants courir d’un point à l’autre on pressent que l’aménagement pourrait aux beaux jours devenir un terrain de jeux idéal.

La propreté pour enjeu

En attendant la place plaît aux flâneurs du matin. « Elle est belle magnifique ! » s’enthousiasme Mohamed venu s’asseoir avec sa compagne Isabelle. « Plus aérée qu’avant où c’était un peu la jungle. On est ici depuis une demi-heure on n’a pas bougé c’est très agréable. » « J’espère qu’on pourra voir quelques fleurs au printemps des primevères » fait observer Sandrine par ailleurs convaincue. Quant à Alfred Bordelais du coin il s’inquiète d’un détail qui pourrait devenir embarrassant :

« Pour l’instant c’est calme c’est pas mal mais à condition que la place reste propre. Ils ont intérêt à surveiller ça de près il peut vite y avoir des déchets partout. »

À mesure que midi approche on mesure ce qui pourrait lui donner en partie raison. Sous le soleil des dizaines de personnes affluent pour déjeuner sur l’herbe. Aucun pollueur n’est pris en flagrant délit mais déjà une touillette en bois un sachet de sauce un bulletin de la Française des jeux sont échoués sur les pelouses.

Commerçants satisfaits

Les risques de pollution aux détritus sont compensés par la baisse des nuisances sonores et du nombre de pots d’échappement. Les commerçants ne cachent pas leur joie à propos. Gérante d’une boutique de vêtements côté cours de l’Intendance Patricia est « contente que les bus ne s’arrêtent plus devant parce que la devanture du magasin servait d’abribus en permanence. La piétonnisation va mettre en valeur les enseignes on attendait ça depuis longtemps. »

Même constat pour Christine du magasin de chaussures d’à côté heureuse que les travaux soient derrière elle. « C’était difficile on a eu droit à une baisse du chiffre d’affaires l’accès était compliqué pour les livraisons de marchandises… Là je retrouve un côté agréable dans le centre-ville alors que j’avais plutôt tendance à vouloir le fuir avant ! L’architecture est plus visible c’est une invitation à la promenade. » La commerçante regrette simplement que l’ancien Virgin Megastore soit toujours fermé. « Avoir quelque chose à la place ça pourrait amener encore plus de dynamisme. » Sur le devenir des bâtiments l’incertitude est toujours de mise

“It’s kind of comical to see people running for governor like they’re gonna roll back the Chinese and defend the border” former Gov. Mitch Daniels said. “I mean who are they kidding? The job will ultimately be about other things.”

While national flashpoints have long resonated in local elections the extent to which they are transforming politics in this deep-red state is unusual. It’s part of the reason Holcomb and Daniels both say they are withholding endorsements in the race. And it’s changing the tenor of the debate too.

“If this campaign about nothing is about anything it’s about all the candidates’ flaws and the suffocating nature of national politics” said Pete Seat a former Indiana GOP and George W. Bush White House spokesperson.

He added: “Candidates have allowed themselves to succumb to the vixen of national politics and filled the airwaves with increasingly hyperbolic ads about combating China and building a wall all to connect with the most likely primary voters.”

In a state under Republican rule at the top of the ticket for nearly two decades — and one known for orderly and genteel succession at the hands of a strong state party — it’s unfamiliar territory following the sunny Republicanism of Daniels and former Gov. Mike Pence both of whom swore off negative campaigning in Indiana.

Holcomb who has governed as a relative moderate in the style of his own mentor Daniels took to social media earlier this year to chide the field on their “slogans” and “empty campaign promises.”

“I think that’s a trend that’s unfortunate in many respects and it may be inevitable in federal elections” said Daniels who weighed gubernatorial and senatorial bids of his own following his exit from Purdue University where he served as president for more than a decade. “If it starts to dominate state and local elections it’ll crowd out things that people could do something about while talking about things they really can’t.”

Democrats have not won a statewide race here since 2012. The winner of the Republican primary is highly favored to win in November against Jennifer McCormick a Democrat who won statewide in 2016 as a Republican state schools chief but switched parties in the Trump era.

For Republicans the great irony of the race is that the historically large field that is focusing so exclusively on national issues formed in part because few of the candidates wanted to run for Braun’s senate seat citing a disinterest in dealing with dysfunction in Washington.

The contest began forming nearly three years ago when Fort Wayne developer Eric Doden launched a listening tour. It became increasingly crowded in December of 2022 when Crouch and Braun launched their candidacies within days of one another. Rather than vie to attend to D.C. gridlock a generationally large GOP bench chose to try to succeed Holcomb.

Braun who with Trump’s endorsement is firmly ensconced as the field’s front-runner is expected to run away with the Tuesday contest.

“He started out as the frontrunner. He has name ID. He’s got good money and he has the Trump endorsement so I’m having a hard time seeing how he doesn’t win this” said Christine Matthews the GOP pollster who worked for Daniels of Braun’s candidacy.

By January of this year both Doden and state Commerce Secretary Brad Chambers the two more socially moderate candidates in the race were plotting ways to muscle the other out of the field. Doden’s parents wealthy from a turn in the steel business dumped millions into his bid. But his campaign went dark over the holidays leaving Chambers’ camp weighing whether to write Doden’s father a memo offering him a “seat at the table” in a Chambers administration in exchange for his son dropping out of the race according to two people familiar with the plans and granted anonymity to discuss the campaign’s strategy in the closing days of the primary. But that never materialized.

Privately Doden’s camp said for months that Chambers entered the race too late to make a difference and should have dropped out earlier to prevent Braun from dividing the field according to a Doden adviser.

But the baddest blood surfaced between Crouch and Holcomb. Crouch seeking to distance herself from Holcomb’s path of moderate management during the pandemic — ordering some non-essential businesses to shutter operations — that she gave him a “C” for his performance amid the pandemic in a debate.

“She wants all the positives for being Eric’s lieutenant governor so anything good that she wants to take credit for but anything that at all seems negative or that she can create a wedge when she wants to do that and try to get the positives from that” said Kyle Hupfer the GOP party chair. “I don’t think it’s a very honorable approach.”

Crouch through a spokesperson declined to punch back saying her campaign is “about the future of Indiana.”

She said her lack of communication with Holcomb was about wanting “to have their freedom to run my own campaign.”

“It doesn’t take a political scientist to see what she wants” Hupfer said. “She wants her cake and to eat it too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vbGlmZS9mb29kLWRyaW5rLzItc2VhdHRsZS1hcmVhLWRpc3RpbGxlcmllcy13aW4tYmlnLWF0LXByZXN0aWdpb3VzLXdvcmxkLXNwaXJpdHMtY29tcGV0aXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Seattle-area distilleries win big at prestigious world spirits competition,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The Cloud 3 guitar which Prince wielded during tours such as Purple Rain Parade Sign of the Times Lovesexy and Diamonds and Pearls is estimated to fetch between $400000 (£320000) and $600000 but could beat this estimate to become the most expensive Prince guitar sold at auction.

The current highest-selling guitar belonging to the seven-time Grammy-winning artist is a blue teal Cloud that sold for $700000 in 2017.

The yellow Cloud 3 was last sold nearly 20 years ago for £4200 by Christie’s – significantly lower than its original listing of £59000 because it had not then been verified that it was one of the original Clouds Prince played at the peak of his fame.

Now the auction house Julien’s in California has verified the guitar’s provenance by conducting a CT scan and interviewing Dave Rusan the luthier behind its creation. It remains fully playable and carries a certificate of authenticity.

“Julien’s Auctions has laid the groundwork for the return of Prince’s Cloud 3 guitar exemplified by our longstanding commitment to honoring his legacy” said David Goodman the auction house’s chief executive.

“Our company proudly stands by our proven track record in sourcing and presenting instruments of unparalleled historical significance and Prince’s Cloud 3 now joins this esteemed category.”

The Cloud 3 is being sold alongside other marquee axes from some of rock’s greatest artists. They include John Lennon’s recently found Help! Framus 12-string Hootenanny acoustic guitar and more than 200 of Randy Bachman’s guitars.

Also on the podium will be Bob Dylan and Robbie Robertson’s 1965 Fender Telecaster Bono’s 2005 Gretsch Irish Falcon Sex Pistol Steve Jones’s 1974 Gibson Les Paul Heart’s Nancy Wilson’s 1984 Duncan Quattro electric guitar and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead’s 1975 Travis Bean.

Prince’s Cloud 3 will join the previously announced exhibition tour of the auction at the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville from 15-18 May.

Author: Mel Sheehan

Rebecca Rose discusses her time as a student in the VCU History M.A. Program and her new role at the Library of Congress.

Views expressed in this interview belong to the individual and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Library of Congress.

Why did you choose VCU for your M.A.?

I was applying to masters programs and having to choose between them when COVID started. There were a few different programs I was looking at and I was emailing back and forth with Dr. Raymond at VCU and I just felt like “oh my gosh she’s so nice and so helpful.” She even put me in touch with students at VCU. It just made me feel that even though I couldn’t be on campus and meet professors everyone was willing to help me make that decision and give me as much information as I needed. Best choice I ever made.

What M.A. program did you do?

I did my master’s in history. It’s in history broadly but I focused on early Virginia history. I also got to take classes in all sorts of things which was just so much fun—like Russian history with Dr. Munro intellectual history with Dr. Bendersky and the Cold War with Dr. Ewing. My thesis was on a spy at Jamestown in the 17th century.

Why did you choose history?

Going into undergrad I knew I was going to be a history major. I can’t help it it just fascinates me. It’s what I am naturally interested in what I gravitate towards. It wasn’t necessarily a calculated decision like “History’s gonna be better for me than these other majors.” If I’m left to my own devices this is what I’m interested in.

What are your takeaways from the program?

Going back to how amazing the faculty is I’m still in touch with professors from VCU. That feeling of connection and those connections themselves are a takeaway. In addition to learning from them as professors VCU faculty have served as references and recommenders for me—I definitely owe where I am to the program and I’m so grateful. It’s actually Dr. Eastman who connected us to do this interview! When I was working on my thesis my wonderful advisor Dr. Meacham also put me in touch with a colleague in the English department who could help me read period documents. Dr. Eckhardt is the faculty sponsor for the Superscripts VCU’s student paleography (old handwriting) club. I still go to meetings and I encourage any history student at VCU who studies the early modern era to show up to a Superscripts meeting and learn to read what’s called “secretary hand.” Dr. Dickinson also stepped into the project without ever having met me and helped me make it to the finish line.

After graduating you landed a job at the Library of Congress. Why did you choose to work there?

After teaching high school U.S. history for a year I realized I hadn’t really given myself a chance to think about what else was out there. I thought “I just really owe it to myself to take some time see what else is out there and see how I can use my skills in the wider world.” I just started applying to a bunch of jobs and since I live in D.C. I was applying to a lot of federal jobs. I was drawn to working at the Library because I wanted a research job. I thought I wanted to work with the Congressional Research Service. They put together nonpartisan reports on various subjects for Congress. I thought that was perfect for a history major. I applied to every open job listing at the Library and I got an interview for my current job not really knowing what it was.

What is it like working there?

I work in Duplication Services which is on the business side of the library. We help customers who want a copy of a document or image that we have in the Library’s collection. These customers are not able to come into the library and look it up themselves for various reasons. For example I just filled an order for a customer in Japan and for that customer it was not feasible for them to come. Sometimes customers want a reproduction of an image for an exhibit or other project. What’s really cool about my job is that I get kind of a bird’s eye view of everything. I get to go collect incredible material from the Library’s different subject-matter reading rooms and learn about the collections in each of these places. It’s also really exciting to be working on Capitol Hill. The Library is three buildings; they’re all connected by underground tunnels to each other and to Congress.

How do you take what you learned from your M.A. and apply it to your job?

Having research skills is definitely helpful. It wasn’t a job requirement but having the lay of the land historically and being able to understand the context for what a customer has requested helps me. Historical orientation and having a love of primary sources is helpful. That’s all that I do all day—look at cool primary sources— it’s amazing. Supreme Court justices’ papers vintage Lego ads 18th century books about pirates even items from the Library’s Third Reich collection which are books that were confiscated from the Nazis and shipped to the U.S. after WWII.

If a student wanted to be in a similar line of work would you recommend the program you did or a different one?

If you’re going to get your master’s in history you should do it because you love it and you should be willing to be creative about how you’re going to use it in your career. Don’t do it in an instrumental way because you think doing this program is going to be the ticket that gets you into whatever career field. Do it because you really want to learn and you are really passionate about history.

What advice would you give to other M.A. students or undergrad students?

If anyone is looking for this kind of career track federal job applications take forever. I applied for this job in May 2023 and didn’t start working until November 2023. It takes a really long time. As with most job applications the whole process can be incredibly disheartening. You get rejected for reasons you can’t possibly fathom. You just gotta keep cranking the job applications out. Make good connections while you’re at VCU. Take advantage of being a student. Take a look at what internships are available. Reach out to people who work in places you want to work or do things you want to do; just ask to hear about what their path has been."
ATO,Atmos Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm93ZW5zYm9yb3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDIvYXRtb3Mtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLW5vLWdhcy1zdXBwbHktaXNzdWVzLWluLWtlbnR1Y2t5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atmos officials: No gas supply issues in Kentucky,"Though Texas-based Atmos Energy issued a warning earlier this week for an urgent need to conserve energy during the historic winter storm officials said there have not been any supply issues for their service in Kentucky.

“Atmos Energy has not experienced any supply issues in Kentucky nor do we expect any service issues” Mark Martin Vice President Public Affairs said in an email. “While the weather is cold we’ve had colder weather in the past and our systems held up fine.”

If there were ever a chance of gas running out Atmos Energy has procedures in place to address any issues.

Atmos released messages on Tuesday and Thursday from their Dallas headquarters saying demand for natural gas was “at unprecedented levels” and that there could be outages — though Martin again stressed there were no supply issues in Kentucky.

“Unfortunately Texas experienced an extended severe cold period that created service issues for some companies down there” Martin said. “The severe cold weather has not been limited to Texas and has impacted the daily market.”

Martin said the company was not sure yet if customer bills would be affected but they are doing what they can to lessen any negative impact.

Atmos has nine proprietary storage assets — including one in Kentucky — from which to draw gas.

“Atmos Energy is still evaluating the impact if any of this cold snap” he said. “The majority of Atmos Energy’s supply will be priced at first of the month index pricing that was not impacted by the current cold snap. Also Atmos Energy is withdrawing as much gas out of storage as possible to mitigate any impacts of the daily market.”

Martin said many but not all of their industrial customers chose a “transportation service” where they purchase their gas from third-party suppliers.

It was that time of the event where Autodesk India and SAARC Technical Solutions specialist Media and Entertainment Samit Shetty hosted a session Connect Collaborate & Conquer your Creative workflows in 2021 with Futureworks Media founder and CEO – Gaurav Gupta and Futureworks Media pipeline specialist Siddhartha Basu .

The session commenced with Shetty’s presentation on how Autodesk’s tool Shotgun simplifies creative project management and unifies visual effects (VFX) animation and gaming teams of all sizes. Shetty enlightened us with various features of the tool and by using them how organisations will be benefitted. He added “Productions are going global as all artists need to work from home which again becomes an independent location for facilities so the complications started becoming bigger and global and to overcome that we have this tool Shotgun which does production management creative collaboration and integrated workflow.”

Shotgun Software won the science technology award at the OSCARS Scientific and Technical awards 2021 and during the pandemic it also won National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The remote working style which the industry adapted massively during the pandemic has a lot of challenges especially for a studio working on multiple projects. As multiple projects require multiple data respective in respect to each project in the form of notes PDF project file and so on which creates chaos where artists are located in different parts of the world. To ease the process Shotgun comes into the scene. He shared “Shotgun database sits on the cloud the task is assigned to an artist and the artist is going to submit the job to the cloud and simultaneously everyone from internal stakeholders to external stakeholders can review them and give the feedback and this tightly integrated cycle goes on.”

Benefits of using Shotgun:

Every aspect of production lives centrally in Shotgun not buried in email or spread across spreadsheets apps and tools. One can see the status and latest versions at all times.

One will always know who’s working on what and when are the tasks scheduled to start and finish. It proactively fills gaps and handles unexpected changes with ease.

Having accurate data on past projects helps with planning staffing and estimating so you can bid aggressively on new projects.

Moving to the next section of the session Shetty opened the floor for Futureworks Media to understand how the studio has benefited from using the tool. Gupta shared “We can’t think of working any other way without using Shotgun. As you grow from five artists to 200 artists it becomes impossible to communicate and keep track of the various different assets on excel sheets the complexity is tremendous.”

As the workload increases maintaining the project’s pipeline and supervising everything under one roof become essential and all the files when located separately can become chaotic and that is when Shotgun eases the challenges. “At Futureworks everything begins and ends with Shotgun. The idea is to bring everything in be it either it is production tracking production planning scheduling all are reviewing all our different versions all our different assets everything is part of Shotgun.”

Further with Basu  Shetty discussed RV which is also part of the Shotgun platform and Future Works have been using it for a while. Here is how RV helps-

To review mixed resolutions formats and frame rates.

Better performance out of the box with improved default caching settings.

View in context on your desktop or in the theater.

Enjoy annotation and synchronised review from anywhere in the world.

Compare shots with wipes A/B or tiled contact sheets.

Load in color profiles with OCIO perform interactive color adjustments view the final image.

Transcode frames movies and audio formats.

Basu added “ RV is mighty in terms of media playback we not only use it for reviews but we also use it to debug and check all the render passes that we have from the lighting department. So the images with layers were perfect and we can scrub through the timeline very easily.”

Born the fifth child of seven in Chennai (formerly Madras) to a middle-class Telugu family Lalitha married at just 15 and gave birth to her daughter Syamala soon after. Four months later her husband passed away and rather than grieving she with her father’s support (a professor himself) decided to pursue a secondary education. This was significant for Lalitha because widows were traditionally expected to fulfill more traditional roles in grief and beyond. However she was determined to grow from her experiences and engineering was in her blood—her father and brothers were also engineers.

A Rich Educational Background

Ayyalasomayajula Lalitha studied at the once entirely male College of Engineering Guindy (CEG) graduating in 1943 with a degree in electrical engineering and earning the title of first female engineer in all of India. P.K. Thressia and Leelamma Koshie both women engineers also studied at the school and although her juniors by one year graduated at the same time as Lalitha because of changes to the program brought on by war. Together these three women helped pave the way for women engineers all across India.

Once she graduated Lalitha completed a one-year apprenticeship in Jamalpur Railway Workshop and accepted work as an assistant engineer at the Central Standards Organization of India in Shimla. She later assisted her father with research on both smokeless ovens and an electrical musical instrument (also known as the jelectromonium). Finally she took a job at Associated Electrical Industries as a design engineer focusing on power transmission equipment including protective gear substation and generator design.

As part of Associated Electrical Industries she designed transmission lines and substation layouts for Bhakra Nangal Dam India’s largest dam. As part of her job she was often in the field. Her office in Kolkota was eventually taken over by General Electric Company.

By 1953 Ayyalasomayajula Lalitha had been elected as an associate member and then a full member by 1964 of the Council of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. She was the only female engineer attendee of the First International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists (ICWES) held in New York. In 1965 she was elected to the British Women’s Engineering Society where she was the representative for the Second International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists in 1967. She later retired from the workforce after 30 years.

Lalitha’s Impact

Lalitha never remarried instead deciding to live with her sister-in-law who played a significant role in caring for Syamala. Throughout her career she was a champion for women in engineering granting interviews with magazines and newspapers about the value of women in STEM careers and encouraging women to attend conferences and enroll in school.

In 1979 Lalitha passed away. Even then her influence as India’s first woman engineer remained. Syamala followed in her mother’s footsteps studying mathematics and science and later becoming a math teacher while also raising children who became scientists. Lalitha’s inspiration stretches wide—within her family and even more across India.

Openshift To the Rescue!,"Photo by Stephen Dawson on Unsplash

Kubernetes is our new Operating System no one can doubt that anymore. As a lot of effort has been made in order to develop a micro-services approach and migrate workloads towards Kubernetes organizations left their data services behind.

We all saw due to COVID-19 how important data is and how important it is to have the proper architecture and data fabric. Data won’t stop from growing! more even it’ll just keep breaking its consumption records one year after the other.

This challenge forces us to provide a more automatic and scalable solution to our organization by moving our data services to Kubernetes where all the magic happens. Kubernetes offers Operators that will help you manage both day-1 and day-2 operations using health checks state preserving auto-pilots etc.

In this demo I’d like to show you how you can run your automatic data pipelines using Operators that are offered in every Openshift installation via the Operator Hub . I chose to take Real-Time BI as a use case and build this demo around it. This demo leverages Openshift’s mechanisms in order to create scalable Kubernetes-based data pipelines and uses all the de-facto standard products in order to fulfill those requirements. All Operators will be deployed on an Openshift 4 cluster while Openshift Container Storage will provide the underlying storage solution for both Object and Block storage protocols.

This demo deploys a music streaming application that generates events based on users’ behavior (will be explained further).

Demo Architecture

Using that data that is being generated we can use Open Source tools in order to create our dashboards and visualizations and provide our stakeholders so as our data scientists a more reliable way to visualize important data.

THIS AFFECTS BUSINESS LOGIC DIRECTLY!

Now that the message is clear let’s start playing!

Prerequisites

A running Ceph Cluster (> RHCS4)

A running Openshift 4 cluster (> 4.6.8)

An OCS cluster in external mode to provide both Object and Block storage

Installation

Create a new project in your Openshift cluster where all resources should be deployed:

$ oc new-project data-engineering-demo

Install both AMQ Streams and Presto Operators as we’ll need those to create our relevant resources. go the the Operator Hub section on the left panel to install:

Installed Operators in the created project

Clone the needed git repository so you’ll be able to deploy the demo:

Change your directory into the demo directory where all manifests are located:

$ cd cephdemos/data-engineering-pipeline-demo-ocp

Data Services Preparation

Preparing our S3 environment

Now that we have all the prerequisites ready let’s start by creating our needed S3 resources. As we are using an external Ceph cluster we should create the needed S3 user in order to interact with the cluster. Additionally we need to create an S3 bucket so that Kafka could export our events to the data lake. Let’s create those resources:

$ cd 01-ocs-external-ceph && ./run.sh && cd ..

The expected output:

{

""user_id"": ""data-engineering-demo""

""display_name"": ""data-engineering-demo""

""email"": """"

""suspended"": 0

""max_buckets"": 1000

""subusers"": []

""keys"": [

{

""user"": ""data-engineering-demo""

""access_key"": ""HC8V2PT7HX8ZFS8NQ37R""

""secret_key"": ""Y6CENKXozDDikJHQgkbLFM38muKBnmWBsAA1DXyU""

}

.

.

.

}

make_bucket: music-chart-songs-store-changelog

The script uses awscli in order to export our credentials as environment variables so that we'll be able to create the bucket properly. Make sure that you have access to your endpoint URL with all the open ports so that this script will work properly.

Deploying Kafka new-ETL

Now that we have our S3 ready we need to deploy all the needed Kafka resources. In this section we’ll deploy a Kafka cluster using the AMQ Streams operator that is offered via the Openshift Operator Hub . Additionally we'll deploy Kafka Topics and Kafka Connect as well in order to export all of the existing topic events to our S3 bucket. Important! make sure that you change the endpoint URL to suit yours or else Kafka Connect will try to expose the events with no success.

Run the script in order to create those resources:

$ cd 02-kafka && ./run.sh && cd ..

Now let’s verify all pods were successfully created:

$ oc get pods

NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE

amq-streams-cluster-operator-v1.6.2-5b688f757-vhqcq 1/1 Running 0 7h35m

my-cluster-entity-operator-5dfbdc56bd-75bxj 3/3 Running 0 92s

my-cluster-kafka-0 1/1 Running 0 2m10s

my-cluster-kafka-1 1/1 Running 0 2m10s

my-cluster-kafka-2 1/1 Running 0 2m9s

my-cluster-zookeeper-0 1/1 Running 0 2m42s

my-connect-cluster-connect-7bdc77f479-vwdbs 1/1 Running 0 71s

presto-operator-dbbc6b78f-m6p6l 1/1 Running 0 7h30m

We see that all pods are in a running state and passed their probes so let’s verify we have the needed topics:

$ oc get kt

NAME CLUSTER PARTITIONS REPLICATION FACTOR

connect-cluster-configs my-cluster 1 3

connect-cluster-offsets my-cluster 25 3

connect-cluster-status my-cluster 5 3

consumer-offsets---84e7a678d08f4bd226872e5cdd4eb527fadc1c6a my-cluster 50 3

music-chart-songs-store-changelog my-cluster 1 1

played-songs my-cluster 12 3

songs my-cluster 12 3

Those topics will be used by our streaming application to receive transform and export those events with the proper format into our S3 bucket. In the end topic music-chart-songs-store-changelog will hold all the information with its final structure so that we'll be able to query it.

Running Presto for Distributed Querying

In this demo we’ll use Presto’s ability to query S3 bucket prefixes (similar to tables in relational databases). Presto needs a schema to be created in order to understand what is the file structure that it needs to query in our example all events that are being exported to our S3 bucket will look like the following:

{""count"":7""songName"":""The Good The Bad And The Ugly""}

Each file will be exported with a JSON structure that holds two key-value pairs. To emphasize you can think of it as a table with two columns where the first one is count and the second is songName  and all files that are being written to the bucket are just rows with this structure.

Now that we have a better understanding of our data structure we can deploy our Presto cluster. This cluster will create a hive instance to store the schema metadata (with Postgres to store the schema information) and a Presto cluster that contains the coordinator and worker pods. All of those resources will be automatically created by the Presto Operator which is offered as part of the Openshift Operator Hub as well.

Let’s run the script to create those resources:

$ cd 04-presto && ./run.sh && cd ..

Now let’s verify all pods were successfully created:

$ oc get pods | egrep -e ""presto|postgres""

NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE

hive-metastore-presto-cluster-576b7bb848-7btlw 1/1 Running 0 15s

postgres-68d5445b7c-g9qkj 1/1 Running 0 77s

presto-coordinator-presto-cluster-8f6cfd6dd-g9p4l 1/2 Running 0 15s

presto-operator-dbbc6b78f-m6p6l 1/1 Running 0 7h33m

presto-worker-presto-cluster-5b87f7c988-cg9m6 1/1 Running 0 15s

Visualizing real-time data with Superset

Superset is a visualization tool that can present visualization and dashboards from many JDBC resources such as Presto Postgres etc. As Presto has no real UI that provides us the ability to explore our data controlling permissions and RBAC we’ll use Superset.

Run the script in order to deploy Superset in your cluster:

$ cd 05-superset && ./run.sh && cd ..

Now verify all pods were successfully created:

$ oc get pods | grep superset

superset-1-deploy 0/1 Completed 0 72s

superset-1-g65xr 1/1 Running 0 67s

superset-db-init-6q75s 0/1 Completed 0 71s

Nice! all went well!

Data Logic Preparation

After we have all of our infrastructure services ready we need to create the data logic behind our streaming application. As Presto queries data from our S3 bucket we need to create a schema that will allow Presto to know how it should query our data so as a table to provide the structure knowledge.

Login to your Presto Coordinator node:

$ oc rsh $(oc get pods | grep coordinator | grep Running | awk '{print $1}')

Change your context to work with the hive catalog:

$ presto-cli --catalog hive

Create a schema that’ll tell Presto to use the s3a connector in order to query data from our S3 bucket prefix:

$ CREATE SCHEMA hive.songs WITH (location='s3a://music-chart-songs-store-changelog/music-chart-songs-store-changelog.json/');

Change the schema context and create a table:

$ USE hive.songs;

$ CREATE TABLE songs (count int songName varchar) WITH (format = 'json' external_location = 's3a://music-chart-songs-store-changelog/music-chart-songs-store-changelog.json/');

Pay attention! creating the table provides Presto the actual knowledge of each file’s structure as we saw in the previous section. Now let’s try to query our S3 bucket:

$ select * from songs;

count | songname

-------+----------

(0 rows) Query 20210203_162730_00005_7hsqi FINISHED 1 node

Splits: 17 total 17 done (100.00%)

1.01 [0 rows 0B] [0 rows/s 0B/s]

We have no data and it’s OK! we haven’t started streaming any data but we see that we get no error which means Presto can access our S3 service.

Streaming Real-Time Events

Now that all resources are ready to use we can finally deploy our streaming application! Our streaming application is actually a Kafka producer that simulates a media player it has a pre-defined list of songs that are being randomly “played” by our media player. Each time a user plays a song the event is being sent to a Kafka topic.

Then we’re using Kafka Streams in order to transform the data to our wanted structure. Streams will take each event that is being sent to Kafka transform it and write it to another topic where it’ll be automatically exported to our S3 bucket.

Let’s run the deployment:

$ cd 03-music-chart-app && ./run.sh && cd ..

Let’s verify all pods are running the player-app pod is our media player while the music-chart pod is actually a pod that holds all the Kafka Streams logic:

$ oc get pods | egrep -e ""player|music""

music-chart-576857c7f8-7l65x 1/1 Running 0 18s

player-app-79fb9cd54f-bhtl5 1/1 Running 0 19s

Let’s take a look at the player-app logs:

$ oc logs player-app-79fb9cd54f-bhtl5 2021-02-03 16:28:41970 INFO [org.acm.PlaySongsGenerator] (RxComputationThreadPool-1) song 1: The Good The Bad And The Ugly played.

2021-02-03 16:28:46970 INFO [org.acm.PlaySongsGenerator] (RxComputationThreadPool-1) song 1: The Good The Bad And The Ugly played.

2021-02-03 16:28:51970 INFO [org.acm.PlaySongsGenerator] (RxComputationThreadPool-1) song 2: Believe played.

2021-02-03 16:28:56970 INFO [org.acm.PlaySongsGenerator] (RxComputationThreadPool-1) song 3: Still Loving You played.

2021-02-03 16:29:01972 INFO [org.acm.PlaySongsGenerator] (RxComputationThreadPool-1) song 2: Believe played.

2021-02-03 16:29:06970 INFO [org.acm.PlaySongsGenerator] (RxComputationThreadPool-1) song 7: Fox On The Run played.

We see that we have the data being written randomly each time a song is being played an event is being sent to our Kafka topic. Now let’s take a look at our music-chart logs:

$ oc logs music-chart-576857c7f8-7l65x [KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 2 PlayedSong [count=1 songName=Believe]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 8 PlayedSong [count=1 songName=Perfect]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 3 PlayedSong [count=1 songName=Still Loving You]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 1 PlayedSong [count=1 songName=The Good The Bad And The Ugly]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 6 PlayedSong [count=1 songName=Into The Unknown]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 3 PlayedSong [count=2 songName=Still Loving You]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 5 PlayedSong [count=1 songName=Sometimes]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 2 PlayedSong [count=2 songName=Believe]

[KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000006]: 1 PlayedSong [count=2 songName=The Good The Bad And The Ugly]

We see that data is being transformed successfully and that the count number increases as users play more songs.

Now we need to make sure our pipeline works so let’s go the our S3 service to verify all events are being exported successfully. for this purpose I’ve used Sree as the S3 browser. Make sure you’re using the right credentials and endpoint URL:

S3 browser of our created bucket prefix

Let’s go back to our Presto coordinator pod and try to query our data again:

$ presto> presto-cli --catalog hive

$ presto:songs> USE hive.songs;

Run the SQL query in order to fetch our data:

$ select * from songs;

count | songname

-------+-------------------------------

1 | Bohemian Rhapsody

4 | Still Loving You

1 | The Good The Bad And The Ugly

3 | Believe

1 | Perfect

1 | Sometimes

2 | The Good The Bad And The Ugly

2 | Bohemian Rhapsody

3 | Still Loving You

4 | Sometimes

2 | Into The Unknown

4 | Believe

4 | Into The Unknown

2 | Sometimes

5 | Still Loving You

3 | The Good The Bad And The Ugly

Amazing! We see that our data is being updated automatically! try running this command a few more times and you’ll see that the number of rows grows. Now in order to start visualizing our data look for the Superset route where you’ll be able to login to the console:

$ oc get route NAME HOST/PORT PATH SERVICES PORT TERMINATION WILDCARD

superset superset-data-engineering-demo.apps.ocp.spaz.local superset 8088-tcp None

When we reach our Superset console (login with admin:admin ) we can see that we can go to Manage Databases --> Create Database to create our Preto connection make sure you put your Presto's ClusterIP service name at the end make sure you test your connection:

Testing Presto’s connection while creating a database

Now that we can have a more convenient way to query our data let’s try exploring our data a bit. Go to SQL Lab  and see that you can perform our previous query. To emphasize watch the following query that will show how many times each song has been played:

Creating a Query to Visualization

Good! we can query data! feel free to create all your wanted visualizations and dashboards. As an example I’ve created a dashboard that changes in real-time as every refresh to the dashboard actually queries all the data from Presto once again:

Real-Time data dashboard

Conclusion

In this demo we saw how we can leverage Open Source products in order to run automatic data pipelines all scheduled on Openshift. As Kubernetes breaks the records of adoption organizations should consider moving their workloads towards Kubernetes so that their data services won’t be left behind. Using Red Hat and Partner Operators Openshift offers both day-1 and day-2 management to your data services.

In good seasons mediocre seasons and wholly unfulfilling ones Richmond almost always beats Duquesne.

Doesn’t matter who’s on the court who’s pacing in the coaches’ boxes who’s officiating or who’s watching. Doesn’t matter where the game is played.

UR handled Duquesne 79-72 Saturday night at the Robins Center making the Spiders 22-2 against the Dukes in Atlantic 10 regular-season competition since Richmond joined the league in 2001.

UR forward Tyler Burton (16 points eight rebounds) elevated to contest a baseline jumper by Marcus Weathers forcing a miss with 24 seconds left and the Spiders leading by 2. Nathan Cayo rebounded. Richmond scored the game’s last 7 points and put it away at the free throw line.

Richmond guards Blake Francis and Jacob Gilyard each scored 17 and forward Grant Golden had eight assists to go with 10 points and eight rebounds. The Spiders held a double-digit lead for much of the first half and early in the second and then fought off the Dukes through the final tight nine minutes.

“We hit a couple of shots big-time shots” said Gilyard whose 3 with 1:30 left was one of them. “We were fouling a little too much. I think even down the stretch we started to just give them just free points by free throws. Didn’t get a lot of rebounds. Definitely could have been a cleaner win for us for sure.”

Peel away all of this matchup’s one-sided history and Saturday’s game stats and there was an unprecedented factor that helped UR (12-5 5-3 A-10) reign supreme: the Dukes (7-7 6-6 A-10) came off a 17-day COVID-related break.

Richmond dominated early showing no evidence of a hangover from Wednesday’s 68-56 loss at VCU where the Spiders scored a season-low points and shot 32.8% also a season worst.

Regardless of the outcome of Saturday’s game UR coach Chris Mooney recognized progress. His team was paused for two weeks before visiting VCU.

Ball movement and 3-point shooting moved the Spiders to a 15-point lead with six minutes left in the first half and to a 40-33 advantage at the break.

And then the Dukes gradually came back establishing themselves inside as scorers and slowing down the Spiders.

“They’re a great offensive rebounding team and that really hurt us throughout the second half” said Mooney. “But I thought coming up with a couple of tough ones late was big.”

After the Dukes cut the Spiders’ lead to 53-49 with 12:32 left DU coach Keith Dambrot shouted “All we’ve got to is guard!”

Duquense took a 62-61 lead with 6:58 left.

Richmond starts four seniors and that experience showed down the stretch.

Next: The Spiders host Massachusetts on Tuesday at 6 p.m. on NBCSN. The Minutemen (7-4 6-2 A-10) haven’t played since Feb. 6 because of COVID-related cancellations and have played only six games since Dec. 30.

Friday UR visits Saint Louis and the Spiders wrap up their regular season with a March 1 game against Saint Joseph’s at the Robins Center.

Doha: Oil prices fell for a second day on Friday retreating further from recent highs as Texas energy companies began preparations to restart oil and gas fields shuttered by freezing weather and power outages. Brent crude futures ended the session down $1.02 or 1.6 percent at $62.91 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $1.28 or 2.1 percent to settle at $59.24. For the week Brent gained about 0.5 percent while WTI fell about 0.7 percent.

Last week both benchmarks had climbed to the highest in more than a year. In Texas and the southern states frigid weather curtailed up to four million bpd of crude production analysts estimated. Texas refiners halted about a fifth of the nation's oil processing amid power outages and severe cold. Companies were expected to prepare for production restarts on Friday as electric power and water services slowly resume sources said. Furthermore US energy firms this week cut the number of oil rigs operating for the first time since November according to Baker Hughes data.

US crude oil stockpiles fell sharply to their lowest since March as exports jumped in the week before a cold snap hit major energy-producing areas of the US the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday. According to the EIA inventories fell 7.3 million barrels to 461.8 million barrels their lowest since March.

On Thursday the United States said it was ready to talk to Iran about returning to a 2015 agreement that aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Still analysts did not expect a near-term reversal of sanctions on Iran that the previous US administration imposed.

Asian LNG prices slipped last week. Still the fall was limited by potential supply disruptions from the US where a deep freeze prompted energy outages in Texas with natural gas wells and pipelines frozen shut. The average LNG price for April delivery into North-East Asia was estimated at $6.40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) down about 20 cents from the previous week sources said. Prices for cargoes delivered in March were estimated at $6.90 per mmBtu steady from the previous week they added.

US natural gas futures eased on Friday as forecasts showed weather turning less cold. However prices registered a fourth consecutive week of gains on concerns over tight supplies after the Arctic freeze disrupted oil and gas facilities.

The restart of production as temperatures eased sent prices of oil and natural gas lower. Front-month gas futures fell 1.3 cents or 0.4 percent to settle at $3.07 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Prices have gained 5.4 percent for the week.

One trader estimated that about two to three cargoes bound for Asia could be disrupted though this could not immediately be confirmed. Still the impact is expected to be minimal as operations resume. According to Kpler at least one LNG tanker has berthed at Sabine Pass while two more ships have diverted from Corpus Christi towards Sabine Pass.

Since Monday only three LNG cargoes were loaded from US ports for export ship-tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon and data intelligence firm Kpler showed. The US is the world's third-largest LNG exporter and typically loads about two cargoes a day traders said.

In tenders Qatar Petroleum Trading placed the lowest offer for a cargo sought by Pakistan LNG for delivery over 9 to 10 April at a slope rate of 10 percent against Brent crude oil. India's Reliance likely bought a cargo for delivery over 28 February to 2 March at $6.20 to $6.30 per mmBtu while GSPC bought a cargo for delivery over 7 March to 9 at $6.25 to $6.30 per mmBtu industry sources said.",,,,,,,,,

A balancing act at One Point One Yoga

Megan Flinn owner of One Point One Yoga released the studio’s first virtual class video on the same day Gov. Tom Wolf closed all in-person nonessential businesses. The timing was coincidental.

Suddenly her longtime vision of creating an online community was the only option. “So every day after that we were putting out one video for people” Ms. Flinn said.

By June the studio was able to open its doors again but — after talking with students — Ms. Flinn decided to stay virtual. Most people weren’t willing to wear a mask.

“There’s only so much savings that a person can dip into.” Megan Flinn

One Point One Yoga

Instead the studio went outdoors in parks and shared spaces and eventually to students’ backyards. “People came in their cars they left in their cars and we had time in between when we got to be together again” Ms. Flinn said.

Amid all of this she was still paying rent on a studio she didn’t use.

Her own story is a bit like that of the block’s. Before the financial stress of COVID-19 she had been battling the financial stress that comes with an unexpected surgery and cancer diagnosis. Just as she was getting back on her feet the virus hit.

She applied for about 20 loans and grants but since her teachers were considered independent contractors and the first round of Paycheck Protection Program funding was meant to cover payroll she didn’t get any initially. When she finally did she got only enough to cover half a month’s rent.

Ms. Flinn decided to move entirely to virtual classes after she learned that people didn’t want to wear masks while doing yoga. (Matt Freed/Post-Gazette)

Instead of cutting teachers’ salaries she offered fewer classes paying them the same rate but fewer times a week.

By September the classes had shifted back inside but only about a tenth of the normal customers returned Ms. Flinn said. Some didn’t feel comfortable going anywhere some wanted to go somewhere where a mask wasn’t required and some lost a job and couldn’t afford the classes.

Next September Ms. Flinn will have to make a decision: renew the lease or go back to a business model she used to follow of practicing yoga wherever there’s space.

Bank of America broke its record for new patents in 2020 with 444 granted patents and 722 applications filed. Those numbers are among the highest for the financial services industry for the year according to the latest list from the Intellectual Property Owners Association. AI and machine learning patents making up nearly one in five of the total.

AI Invention

In total Bank of America now has around 4400 patents held and filed placing it in the 15 holders of banking-related patents. This year continued the company’s growing use of AI for services for customers and staff members. Bank of America’s new Life Plan product uses predictive AI to give personalized financial advice based on client preferences while a new internal AI-powered service checks for errors and shares recommendations to a client service representative as they work with a customer.

“Bank of America clients benefit every day from our focus on innovation” chief operations and technology officer Cathy Bessant said in a statement. “Continuing to build our patent portfolio is one way that we measure our success. Invention happens across our company at an ever-increasing pace and our 2020 patent performance set records for our firm. Hats off to our teams for their creativity and brilliance.”

Bank Chat

Bank of America also gained new patents related to the voice-activated virtual financial assistant Erica. The AI responds more like a human now thanks to improved command dialogue software. Erica’s userbase has grown to 17 million and it has answered more than 230 million requests since it debuted in 2018. The pace accelerated in 2020 with a 67% year-over-year growth and more than 135 million requests and 58% of interactions taking place last year. A good chunk of those interactions revolved around the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank taught Erica more than 60000 phrases and questions related to the virus to help field questions on the subject.

Bank of America’s push for new and improved voice and AI technology is part of a larger trend in the industry. Some are producing their own virtual assistants like the voice assistant U.S. Bank launched last summer and Russia’s Tinkoff Bank has been promoting its Oleg voice assistant for a while. There are also companies using existing voice assistants such as the Alexa and Google Assistant voice apps created by ICICI one of India’s largest private banks. On the other hand Russian banking giant Sberbank took the concept to the extreme by transforming its focus from finance to tech with a smart display and voice assistant now on sale.

After opening in 2015 Little Leaf Farms has quadrupled in size. The company recently doubled its hydroponic greenhouse-growing capacity from 5 to 10 acres in Massachusetts and plans to continue growing by building more greenhouses across the East Coast.

Equilibrium Capital led the latest round of fundraising. Coppermine Capital founding investor Bill Helman and Pilot House Associates were other key investors. Bank of America has already committed more than $20 million with an additional $20 million planned in financing to support the company's growth.

“After opening our third greenhouse in Massachusetts last summer amid the pandemic we have proven that we can bring the company to scale unlike any other” Paul Sellew Little Leaf Farms founder and CEO said “With our partners and committed financing Little Leaf Farms is positioned to significantly disrupt the traditional lettuce industry and meet customer demand in a year when controlled environment agriculture is expected to soar. We continue to have record sales every week and we only see that continuing.”

Sellew said that his company plans to use the $90 million to upgrade the Devens facility to keep it state-of-the-art and to build new greenhouses. Sellew said New England is currently Little Leaf Farms' core market and the company is looking at locations in north eastern Pennsylvania and North Carolina in order to branch into more East Coast and southeastern markets.

""When you start servicing the Philadelphia market the New York City market you want to have facilities that are closer to that market so that you maintain the local connection"" Sellew said.

A Pennsylvania location could help Little Leaf's presence in cities such as Philadelphia New York City Washington D.C. and Baltimore while Sellew said a North Carolina greenhouse could help the company expand into cities such as Atlanta and Richmond Virginia.

Last year the company doubled its retail sales from 2019 and made $38 million. Their lettuce is available in more than 2500 stores along the East Coast.

“Equilibrium Capital’s growth equity investment in Little Leaf Farms brings together a major player in next-generation indoor agriculture with the leader in CEA investments” said Dave Chen the CEO of Equilibrium Capital who will be joining Little Leaf Farms' board of directors. “Little Leaf Farms is revolutionizing the industry with its sustainable indoor growing technologies to grow fresh nutritious great tasting lettuces and mixes. We are proud to partner with Little Leaf Farms to expand its high-tech farms across the East Coast.”

Little Leaf Farms produces more than 2 million boxes of lettuce each month. Last fall delivery and sales of Little Leaf products were extended into New York New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

“We are supportive of Little Leaf Farms’ efficient growing methods using sunlight and captured rainwater to grow delicious lettuce that only travels locally so it remains flavorful” said Randy Mitchell a senior vice president of global commercial banking at Bank of America. “We believe in the company’s environmentally and socially responsible mission as they expand into new markets on the East Coast.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzM4YzM2NzBjLTNiMGYtNDFlNi04NzRlLTBmOWVlZTU1Mzc0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HSBC intensifies pivot to Asia with job moves and US exit,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

According to the United States of America's Department of Justice Hushpuppi laundered money for North Korean hackers.

The revelation was made known when federal prosecutors in Los Angeles unsealed a case against one Ghaleb Alaumary 37 of Mississauga Ontario Canada for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean conspiracy among other criminal schemes.



Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to engage in money laundering a charge contained in criminal information filed in the United States District Court in Los Angeles on November 17 2020.



Alaumary was a prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes cyber-enabled bank heists business email compromise (BEC) schemes and other online fraud schemes.



Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the United States Attorney's Office for Georgia's Southern District.



During Alaumary's confession he fingered Hushpuppi as one of his co-conspirators.



The document read in part ""Concerning the North Korean co-conspirators' activities Alaumary organized crews of co-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained through ATM cash-out operations including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018.



""Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas aka 'Ray Hushpuppi' and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019.



""Last summer the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles charged Abbas in a separate case alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.""",,,

In a Friday blog post CEO Andrew Torba said Gab took itself offline after several accounts ""were posting bitcoin wallet spam and related content."" Fewer than 20 accounts were affected and no bitcoin was transferred Torba said.

""We have identified and patched a security vulnerability in our codebase"" Torba wrote. ""Our engineering team is conducting a full audit of our logs and infrastructure.""

The scam came on the same day the market capitalization of bitcoin the value of bitcoin available passed $1 trillion. Bitcoin has risen more than 40% in the last month amid a wave of enthusiasm driven by growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and Mastercard said it will integrate cryptocurrencies into its payment network later this year. Bank of New York Mellon the oldest bank in the US said earlier this month that it will begin financing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin scams have been a common social media plague recently and Gab isn't alone in being struck by one. Last July a massive bitcoin scam hit Twitter as hackers took over high-profile accounts including those of Elon Musk Bill Gates Kanye West and Barack Obama.

Gab's Twitter account which disappeared from the short-message service at around the time of the outage still hasn't returned. ""This account doesn't exist"" a page formerly used by Gab read.

Twitter said it didn't take action against the Gab account.

Gab which has previously come under fire for anti-Semitic content hails itself as a platform for free speech a self-characterization also used by Parler a right-wing Twitter clone. Parler was taken offline for about a month after it lost services from Amazon Web Services because the social network was used to organize the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Saturday that bitcoin prices ""seem high"" after the cryptocurrency surged to another record high this week.

The price of bitcoin the world's most popular cryptocurrency crossed a major milestone Friday after the market value reached more than $1 trillion leaving some major backers surprised. Ethereum the second-largest cryptocurrency also hit record highs.

""Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter"" tweeted Musk a major proponent of digital currencies. ""That data like all data is subject to latency & error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.""

In a following post Musk added ""that said BTC & ETH do seem high lol"" in a response to a user who said gold was better than both bitcoin and cash.

Bitcoin was trading at under $54000 per coin Friday as it hit the new level and rose above $55000 later in the session according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency was trading above $57000 on Saturday. The price of bitcoin has gained roughly 350% during the past six months.

Ethereum also hit a record $2040.62 for a weekly gain of roughly 12%. It was trading at $1996 on Saturday.

The bitcoin surge was driven partly by increased adoption by major investors and companies. Bank of New York Mellon said this month that it was moving into the space.

Tesla also converted some of its balance sheet cash into bitcoin earlier this year and said it would begin accepting the digital currency as payment a move that triggered even more interest in the currency.

""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video . ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

It's no secret that celebrities spend a lot of time preparing for the Met Gala whether it's going through hair and makeup trials or eating a specialized diet . Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Jessica Biel attended the Met Gala for the first time since 2013.

The actor showed up on the steps of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City wearing a pink Tamara Ralph gown with a deep neckline and separated sleeves that was adorned with tiny jewels and petals to comply with “The Garden of Time” theme.

This year she appeared without her husband Justin Timberlake as the singer was performing in San Jose California that night.

To prepare for fashion’s biggest night Biel showed a sneak peek of what she does the night before revealing that she specifically bathes in 20 pounds of Epsom salt.

The day of the Met Gala the 7th Heaven actress took to TikTok to show viewers her prep routine. “I know some people like to party before Met Ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that” her video began.

“This is what I do to get ready for Met Ball.”

She then showed multiple large bags of Epsom salt sitting on the edge of a bathtub counting out how many pounds she had in total. “Four eight 12 16 20 pounds of Epsom salt in a bath” Biel said. “Here we go for real.”

After pouring all of the bags into the bathwater the actress clarified that she makes the water “as hot as you can take it”.

“30 minute soak night before” Biel continued. “[Drink] tonnes of water then and off to bed early. See you tomorrow Met Ball.”

“While the kids are out partying I am in soaking” she reiterated in the caption.

After posting her TikTok went on to receive over one million views with many people questioning what benefits she was receiving from using that much Epsom salt especially considering the recommended amount is usually not even one bag let alone five.

According to the Cleveland Health Clinic an Epsom salt bath with 1.25 cups has the ability to provide stress relief relax muscle pain and reduce any inflammation.

“The way she didn’t explain the benefits of using that much is a crime” one comment read before assuming the salt removes water weight.

“Not me wondering if two cups twice the recommended amount was overkill” another commenter questioned.

“I panicked once because I used five cups instead of the recommended four” a second commenter said about the quantity.

“It’s two cups per gallon. Maybe she has a big ol bathtub!” one commenter suggested for why Biel used such a large amount.

Other commenters pointed out how expensive it is to use that much Epsom salt.

“Girl cost of living doesn’t even afford us table salt these days let alone bags of Epsom Salts” one person commented while another wrote: “In this economy?!”

Biel’s last appearance at the Met Gala was 11 years ago when the theme was “PUNK: Chaos to Couture.”

She had worn a strapless black Giambattista Valli gown with a knitted pair of matching pants and black leather pumps. To embody the punk theme even further she showed up with a nose ring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdvcmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9taWRjb2FzdC9taWRjb2FzdC1ob3VzaW5nL3RoZS11cHRvd24tY2luZW1hLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1idWlsZGluZy1iYXRoLWpvYW00MHprMHcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New 60-unit apartment building opens at site of former Bath cinema,"A new 60-unit apartment complex is opening in downtown Bath adding more housing in a city and region that desperately need it.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms."

BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWp1c3Qtc29sZC1oaXMtcGZpemVyLXN0b2NrLXNob3VsZC15L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Just Sold His Pfizer Stock. Should You?,"You should definitely follow Buffett in one way.

Warren Buffett once said ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" Most of the stocks that Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.41%) (BRK.B 0.30%) buys it holds for years -- but not all of them.

Berkshire opened a position in Pfizer (PFE -1.39%) in the third quarter of 2020. In a regulatory filing last week though Berkshire revealed that it had dumped all of its shares in the big drugmaker. Pfizer became one of 37 stocks Buffett sold last year and one of 15 of which he completely exited. Now that Buffett has sold all of his Pfizer stock should investors who aren't billionaires follow suit?

Why Warren why?

Many investors are wondering why Buffett closed out Berkshire's position in Pfizer so quickly. It's first important to note that Buffett might not have made the decision himself. He has increasingly delegated authority to Berkshire's investing managers Todd Combs and Tedd Weschler in recent years. However Buffett presumably went along with the decision to sell Pfizer even he didn't personally call the shot.

Unfortunately Berkshire doesn't include footnotes in its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that explain the reasoning behind each of its stock trades. Buffett (or perhaps Combs or Weschler) will sometimes make a public remark giving the context behind Berkshire's purchase or sale of a given stock. However that's the exception not the rule.

I think it's unlikely that any of these men will comment on the Pfizer sale. The big pharmaceutical company wasn't a major holding for Berkshire. Sure Berkshire reported a value of $136.2 million for its more than 3.7 million shares in its Q3 13F-HR filing to the SEC but that's only a drop in the bucket for the huge conglomerate.

Cross these off the list

We can't know for sure why Buffett or his lieutenants opted to exit the position in Pfizer. However we can cross some possible reasons off the list.

Buffett clearly hasn't soured on all big pharma stocks. Berkshire bought more shares of AbbVie Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck (NYSE: MRK) during the fourth quarter.

It also wasn't a situation where Berkshire decided to cut its losses. Pfizer's average share price during the fourth quarter was higher than in the third quarter.

Did Pfizer's business prospects change for the worse? Not really. Sure the company reported disappointing results from a late-stage study of Ibrance in November. However those results basically just confirmed what investors already expected after another clinical setback for the breast cancer drug earlier in 2020.

In several ways Pfizer's prospects improved during Q4. The company completed its merger of Upjohn with Mylan moving a block of legacy drugs with declining sales off its books. Pfizer won emergency use authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty (BNT162b2) in the U.S. and in Europe. It lined up major supply deals for Comirnaty totaling in the hundreds of millions of doses. The company also reported good news for several of its pipeline programs.

All we can do is guess why Berkshire sold all of its Pfizer shares. I think the most plausible explanation is simply that Buffett and his team thought they could get a higher return by investing in other stocks.

Follow Buffett's advice

Returning to our original question should investors sell Pfizer because Buffett did? The answer to that question is a resounding ""no."" Your investment goals could be (and probably are) very different from a $569 billion holding company.

Many investors bought Pfizer stock for its dividend. That dividend still looks attractive. Others bought shares because they thought Pfizer's growth prospects would increase after the Upjohn-Mylan transaction closed. That's still a good assumption. Still others probably invested in the drugmaker because of its potential to make a lot of money off of its COVID-19 vaccine. The sales potential for the vaccine is greater now than it's been in the past thanks to new orders flowing in.

Are there other stocks that might pay a higher dividend yield or deliver greater growth? Absolutely. But that was the case throughout the last year -- including when Berkshire bought its initial stake in Pfizer.

I think that you should follow Buffett's advice but not necessarily his example. If you were willing to own Pfizer for 10 minutes be willing to own it for 10 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vZmVlLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy93aWxsLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXJlYWxseS1tYWtlLWJpbGxpb25zLW9mZi10aGUta2V5c3RvbmUtcGlwZWxpbmUtcy1kZW1pc2UtaXQtcy1jb21wbGljYXRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Warren Buffett Really Make Billions Off the Keystone Pipeline's Demise? It's Complicated,"The internet is not known as a purveyor of truth. (In case you didn’t know.)

The false information can take many forms. Maybe it’s the fake Robin Williams quote your aunt shared on Facebook. Or perhaps it’s the nutty Qanon conspiracies you see in your Twitter feed. Sometimes it’s more subtle—the news headline that says something that’s actually not in the article. (Editors write headlines not reporters and you’d be surprised how many editors flub headlines.)

Recently there was a meme going around claiming that President Joe Biden spiked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day because of political donations from Warren Buffett the billionaire investor who runs the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.

The meme (which I won’t link to because I don’t want to get slapped down for spreading fake news) went like this:

The Keystone pipeline. Cancelled by Biden on first day. Warren Buffet owns the railroad that is now transporting all that oil. Warren Buffet donated 58 million to Biden campaign. Warren Buffet would lose billions in transport fees if the pipeline is completed. See how politics works? It is not an environmental issue it is a money issue…

The meme contains information that is demonstrably false. Nevertheless it was shared enough that it captured the attention of Reuters who fact-checked the meme.

Keystone Pipeline Background

As Reuters notes the post is referring to the Keystone XL Pipeline a project Biden canceled by executive order on his first day in office. The action was essentially a nail in the coffin to a project that would have carried 830k barrels of heavy oil-sands crude from Alberta to Nebraska per day.

The meme is clearly wrong on multiple points. For starters it doesn’t even spell Buffett’s name correctly. More importantly the assertion that Buffett donated $58 million to the Biden campaign is bogus.

Public records show Buffett didn’t donate to any political campaign in 2020 let alone a $58 million sum and a spokeswoman for Buffett confirmed this.

After being purchased in a $44 billion deal BNSF quickly became Berkshire Hathaway’s ‘single biggest profit driver’ Business Insider reported in 2014.

“Mr. Buffett gave no money to the Biden presidency campaign in 2020” Buffett assistant Debbie Bosanek told Reuters. “He files all filing requirements for political contributions and made no contribution to any PAC.”

So score one for Reuters for setting the record straight (and correctly spelling Buffett’s name).

The news agency also correctly pointed out that Buffett donated to congressional Democrats in 2019 though they declined to say how much. (If you’re wondering three checks alone in 2019 to Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee totaled more than $460000. A hefty sum to be sure—though one Buffett would hardly feel.)

Unfortunately from here Reuters fact check goes off the rails.

Keystone Pipeline Cancelation Won’t Help Buffett?

Reuters spends a lot of time attempting to refute a central claim of the meme: that Buffett “would lose billions in transport fees” if the Keystone pipeline is completed.

As Reuters admits Berkshire Hathaway does in fact own one of the largest railroad networks in North America: the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp which runs 32500 route miles crossing 28 states and several Canadian provinces. The news agency also admits trains on the BNSF carry lots of energy (especially oil and coal).

However Reuters argues that Berkshire Hathaway does not stand to benefit from the demise of the Keystone XL.

“Railroads such as BNSF” Reuters says “are not the principle way oil is transported from Canada to the United States.”

Forty-two people were confirmed dead in the 2013 Quebec train disaster and several more are presumed dead.

Industry experts are quoted and they note the inefficiencies of transporting oil via rail.

“It’s expensive to transport crude by rail especially over long distances” Ben Cahill a senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Reuters. ”Operators prefer to use pipelines and use rail only as a backup.”

In short Reuters says “rail infrastructures cannot compete with existing pipelines” and “cancellation does not appear to mean a lucrative jump in business for crude-by-rail that might benefit Berkshire Hathaway’s BNSF railway.”

The Other Side of the Story

Before explaining what Reuters left out let me say I’m not suggesting Buffett a brilliant investor and businessman had anything to do with the spiking of the Keystone XL pipeline.

That said Reuters’ claims don’t add up and the news agency omits relevant facts about Buffett’s rail operation.

As a bit of history Buffett purchased BNSF in a $44 billion deal in 2009. Months later in an interview with Charlie Rose the sage of Omaha admitted the price tag was steep.

‘Buoyed by an onshore oil boom Burlington Northern Sante Fe has become a cash machine for Mr. Buffett’ Investment News reported in 2015.

“You don’t get bargains on things like that” Buffett said in the interview.

But the truth is Buffett did get a bargain (at least in hindsight). In just a few short years BNSF had become Berkshire Hathaway’s “single biggest profit driver” Business Insider reported.

How did it happen? Oil transport had a lot to do with Investment News reported in 2015.

“Buoyed by an onshore oil boom Burlington Northern Sante Fe has become a cash machine for Mr. Buffett” the news outlet reported. “The railroad had sent more than $15 billion in dividends to Berkshire through Sept. 30 according to quarterly regulatory filings. More stunning: The business is on pace to return all the cash Mr. Buffett spent taking it private by the end of this year.”

None of these facts made it into Reuters’ “fact check.”

Nor did the article discuss the adverse impact of shipping oil by rail. Those exploding oil trains are more common than people realize (see them in pictures) and the human and environmental costs are real and exceed the costs of moving oil by pipeline.

“The horrible truth … is train transport is far more dangerous” energy writer Brian Westenhaus has pointed out.

As just one example forty-two people were confirmed dead in the 2013 Quebec train disaster and several more are presumed dead.

“No pipeline failure has ever come close to this level of human death and suffering” Westenhaus points out.

Rail executives themselves have said they expect to see crude-by-rail shipments increase because of Biden’s executive order.

The US State Department confirms that rail is a more dangerous way to transport oil compared to pipelines.

The environmental impact of rail is also worse. Research shows the spill rate for hazardous material transported by rail is 33 times higher than pipelines. Scholars at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh also found that locomotive transport causes twice as much pollution as pipelines.

A Case of Unproductive Entrepreneurship?

Why would anyone spike an oil pipeline capable of transporting more than 300 million barrels of crude a year when moving oil by pipeline is cheaper safer and more environmentally friendly than moving it by rail?

Reuters never asks this question though it concedes moving oil by rail is less efficient. (There are also benefits to moving oil by rail of course especially over short distances.) But one reason perhaps is that the pipeline was spiked because of its low cost and efficiency.

Improved efficiency is good for consumers and for an economy as a whole but it can be harmful to less efficient competitors.

It’s been observed that in modern America there are two primary types of entrepreneurs: market entrepreneurs and political entrepreneurs.

“A pure market entrepreneur or capitalist succeeds financially by selling a newer better or less expensive product on the free market without any government subsidies ” writes economist Thomas DiLorenzo.

Essentially market entrepreneurs create value for society by serving the wants and needs of consumers. A political entrepreneur on the other hand “succeeds primarily by influencing government to subsidize his business or industry or to enact legislation or regulation that harms his competitors.”

Essentially improved efficiency is good for consumers and for an economy as a whole but it can be harmful to less efficient competitors. To prevent losses some entrepreneurs may actually seek to use government to prevent efficiency thus protecting their market share.

Reuters assured us this is not the case with Buffett. They deny that canceling the Keystone XL would actually benefit BNSF saying that the oil intended for Keystone would simply be moved by “existing and new pipeline infrastructure not railways.”

This claim defies both common sense and an abundance of research however.

Shipping oil by train doesn’t operate under the same price restraints as oil pipelines which are regulated much like utilities by the federal government.

Bloomberg for example had published research showing that trains could expect to carry 125000 more barrels of Canadian crude each day (an increase of more than 40 percent) if the Keystone XL was scrapped.

More recently rail executives themselves have said they expect to see crude-by-rail shipments increase because of Biden’s executive order.

The Verdict

None of this means Warren Buffett had anything to do with Biden’s decision to spike the Keystone Pipeline. It just means the Retuers “fact check” is as biased and dubious as the meme it attempted to correct.

Buffett does stand to profit from the cancelation of the Keystone pipeline and perhaps a great deal. BNSF remains a money machine at Berkshire Hathaway and it’s preposterous to think that canceling a pipeline that was expected to deliver 300 million barrels of crude each year will not result in increased rail transport of crude (even if other pipelines pick up much of the slack.)

These potential profits stand to benefit from the fact that shipping oil by train doesn’t operate under the same price restraints as oil pipelines which are regulated much like utilities by the federal government.

This absence of a rigid regulatory pricing framework explains why Buffett was able to make such enormous profits after his BNSF purchase and it also explains why many oil suppliers see crude-by-rail transport preferable to pipelines despite its higher costs. (As the video below shows suppliers are willing to pay higher short term costs for greater shipping flexibility.)

As for Buffett on one hand he has shown he possesses the lobbying chops to avoid many of the federal regulations that plague his competitors and other parts of the transportations sector. On the other hand one should be careful about levying accusations not grounded in facts and it’s worth noting that publicly Buffett has actually voiced support for the Keystone XL pipeline saying it was “good for the country.”

Ultimately we don’t know why the Keystone Pipeline was shut down. Biden’s executive order offers little explanation beyond platitudes such as claims that the pipeline “would undermine US climate leadership.”

And perhaps that’s the answer. The Keystone XL may have simply become a symbol of dirty nasty oil which meant it had to go—even if there’s little dispute that spiking the pipeline increases pollution and energy costs and puts more lives at risk.

On the other hand it’s not unreasonable to suspect that unproductive entrepreneurship may have played a role. When attempting to solve a mystery police often start with a simple question: Cui bono? Incentives matter as any economist will tell you.

Whatever the answer the real lesson of the Keystone XL pipeline is that when politicians make decisions instead of entrepreneurs acting within the marketplace everyone loses.

Well almost everyone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvc3RvY2tzL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWRpc2Nsb3NlLW5vdC1teXN0ZXJ5LWludmVzdG1lbnQtdmVyeS1zb29uL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvYmFua2luZ3JhdGVzLmNvbS9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvc3RvY2tzL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWRpc2Nsb3NlLW5vdC1teXN0ZXJ5LWludmVzdG1lbnQtdmVyeS1zb29uL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Just Scored an Unexpected $1.4 Billion - and He's About to Disclose Another Mystery Investment Soon,"Warren Buffett Just Scored an Unexpected $1.4 Billion – and He’s About to Disclose Another Mystery Investment Soon

In its latest filing in November the Oracle of Omaha omitted confidential information from the public Form 13F report and filed it separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission according to the filing.

A form 13F is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter for managers with more than $100 million in assets under management according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A manager can request to withhold information if for example the reportable security is likely to be substantially harmed by public disclosure of Form 13F data.

Renewable energy remains red-hot even after a scorching 2020 where renewables trounced the broader market's gains. From small pure-play wind and solar stocks to large companies looking to diversify their revenue mix now seems to be a great time to look for premium renewable energy stocks. But there's a problem. Many of the industry's leading companies are now trading near record highs -- which can be off-putting for investors looking for a lower entry point.

With that we asked some of our contributors which renewable energy stocks they thought were cheap now. They came up with American Electric Power (AEP 1.19%) Dominion Energy (D 1.38%) and Hubbell (HUBB 1.30%).

Power your portfolio with a utility player

Scott Levine (American Electric Power): While politicians debate the role that green energy has played in the Texas power outages smart investors recognize that the political wrangling doesn't detract from the fact that renewable energy stocks represent significant growth opportunities. The challenge for clean-energy-minded investors though is where to turn. Although solar wind and geothermal stocks all represent viable options from which investors can choose American Electric Power (AEP) provides a less obvious approach. And fortunately for investors they can currently find shares in the bargain bin.

Branding itself as ""the premier regulated energy company"" AEP has a presence in 11 states and provides electricity to about 5.5 million customers making it one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States. Management has articulated a clear commitment to environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) values. For example the company is targeting a 42% reduction in its coal capacity by 2030 and it plans on supplanting this in part with ample green energy additions. Over the next 10 years AEP expects to add 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power to its power portfolio and 4.2 GW of wind power.

Unlike the majority of renewable energy stocks that don't reward shareholders by way of a dividend AEP has demonstrated consistent interest in returning capital to investors. Over the past decade AEP -- currently offering investors an attractive 3.8% dividend yield on its stock -- has steadily raised its distribution and it seems intent on continuing that trend.

Management expects to return $2.96 per share to investors in 2021 -- about 4.2% more than it dished out in 2020. Allaying concerns that the company is jeopardizing its financial well-being to please investors with the dividend management has targeted a payout ratio of 60% to 70% -- a range that seems reasonable considering the company's average payout ratio over the past three years has been 62%.

Currently shares of AEP appear attractively priced from a couple of different angles. For one the stock is trading at 20.3 times earnings representing a discount to its five-year average multiple of 27.3. Similarly the stock is trading at 2.6 times sales. While this is slightly higher than its five-year average ratio of 2.4 the valuation is still reasonable considering the S&P 500 P/S ratio is 2.9.

Transitioning from natural gas to renewables

Daniel Foelber (Dominion Energy): Dominion energy is the latest utility stock to launch an aggressive push into renewable energy. The company is a leading energy provider in Utah Ohio Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina. Although Dominion's portfolio is still mostly fossil fuels it has done a good job of moving away from coal toward natural gas over the past 15 years. Its sale of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and other gas transmission and distribution assets to Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway last year marked the first major step in its push to transition away from gas and toward renewables.

That push accelerated further when the company reported fourth-quarter results. Bigger than the numbers themselves was the company's brand new $32 billion five-year capital spending program 52% of which is devoted toward zero-carbon through offshore wind solar energy storage and nuclear relicensing. Offshore wind in particular is a big catalyst for Dominion's growth led by the company's 2.6 GW megaproject that is expected to go into service in 2024.

Impressively enough Dominion is confident that even with the hefty spending plan it will be able to grow earnings per share by at least 6.5% over the next five years. This forecast should be fairly accurate considering 88% of Dominion's existing portfolio is state-regulated. The company also plans to grow its dividend at 6% over the long term. In an effort to fund its renewable aspirations Dominion cut its quarterly dividend from $0.94 per share to $0.63 in December of last year. Even with the cut Dominion yields an impressive 3.5% -- much higher than the current market average of 1.5%.

Given the company's strong existing portfolio aggressive and profitable renewable investments and the fact that shares are on sale for 20% less than a year ago Dominion looks to be a worthwhile renewable energy stock to buy now.

Renewable energy provides growth for Hubbell

Lee Samaha (Hubbell): The words ""cheap"" and ""renewable energy stock"" don't often fit together these days. Therefore if you are looking for a value option you will have to think outside the box or rather outside the sweep of a wind power turbine.

In this context what about buying a highly cash generative value stock with some exposure to renewable energy related spending? That's where electrical and electronic products company Hubbell comes into play. If you are going to have investment in renewable energy farms you are going to need investment in the transmission and distribution (T&D) network as well.

Hubbell's exposure comes through its utility solutions segment responsible for 57% of adjusted operating profit in 2020 with electrical solutions making up the rest. Commenting on the fourth-quarter performance on the earnings release CEO Gerben Bakker said ""In the fourth quarter utility facing markets remained resilient with grid modernization and renewable energy trends driving ongoing strength in demand for T&D components and mid single digit growth in Power Systems.""

Looking ahead management expects its utility T&D components end market to grow 2% to 4% and utility communications and controls to grow 4% to 6%. Coupled with a recovery in the electrical solutions end market management expects Hubbell's sales to grow 6% to 8% with organic sales up 3% to 5%. Management's guidance implies around $495 million in free cash flow (FCF) putting Hubbell on a forward price-to-FCF multiple of 18.5 times.

That's a good value particularly if growth in spending on utility T&D will support mid-single-digit revenue growth over the medium term."

Best answer: Minecraft Dungeons at its most expensive is still very reasonably priced by modern game standards especially when compared to full price ""AAA"" titles like Call of Duty. It's easy to splash a little extra cash for the better version or invest in the growing number of content expansions. If you want to try the game before committing to it Minecraft Dungeons is available through Xbox Game Pass on Xbox Windows and even mobile devices through Xbox Cloud Gaming (Project xCloud).

A great choice no matter what

It's difficult for a studio to break out of its established formula but Mojang Studios has done precisely that with aplomb. Minecraft Dungeons is packed with action and content and it comes at a much more affordable price than many other modern games. This makes choosing between its versions a lot easier without a massive price gap between them with options for players to test the waters before committing to the rapidly expanding pool of content available to buy.

Minecraft Dungeons is available for most modern gaming platforms and Minecraft Dungeons can even be played on mobile devices. Across the board your options (and the prices of those versions) are going to be pretty consistent especially considering that Minecraft Dungeons has cross-play support across platforms.

The most straightforward way players can get into Minecraft Dungeons is through Xbox Game Pass. Available for Xbox and Windows Xbox Game Pass includes hundreds of high-quality games (with more games added to Xbox Game Pass all the time) that gamers can play to their heart's content. Download anything play anything and have it all for one monthly subscription. The base version of Minecraft Dungeons is included in Xbox Game Pass along with all its free updates but not any of its expansions.

Players can use Xbox Game Pass to test the waters with Minecraft Dungeons before committing and then purchase any extra content or expansions at a nice discount included in Xbox Game Pass.

Even better subscribing to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate nets you all of this access to online multiplayer on Xbox consoles and the ability to stream Minecraft Dungeons in its entirety to your mobile device. Take Minecraft Dungeons on the go with some of the Best Accessories for Xbox Cloud Gaming or use Minecraft Dungeons' excellent touch controls to leave the controller and phone mount behind. Either way Minecraft Dungeons is one of the Best Games for Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Minecraft Dungeons included Xbox Game Pass Ultimate $14.54 at Green Man Gaming $16.99 at Best Buy $16.99 at GameStop All your gaming needs in one subscription.

Is the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate the best value in all of gaming? It's possible. Ultimate bundles your Xbox Live Gold subscription an Xbox Game Pass subscription for both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs and Xbox Cloud Gaming for on-the-go. That means access to Minecraft Dungeons on Xbox Windows and even your phone with discounts on all its expansions and DLC.

Breaking down the versions

Minecraft Dungeons is a solid game at its core especially with all the free updates Mojang Studios has released for it but it also has several paid expansions that add new areas gear and more to the game. Players can choose to buy the base game bundles passes that include multiple expansions or even purchase the expansions individually. In the end it all depends on how much you're enjoying Minecraft Dungeons whether or not you're looking to add more content to the base game and which of Minecraft Dungeons' growing number of expansions appeals to you the most.

The base version of Minecraft Dungeons is incredibly affordable compared to most modern games and has received substantial post-launch support since its release in Spring 2020. Across all platforms Minecraft Dungeons comes in at $20 which nets you the core island and all of the free updates the game has received (adding more endgame content enchantments new ways to obtain gear in-game and more).

Not your average Minecraft Minecraft Dungeons $17.59 at Amazon $17.59 at Amazon $19.99 at Amazon Minecraft explores the dungeons.

Minecraft Dungeons is the next saga in Minecraft's story and Mojang Studios have knocked another one out of the park. Awesome co-op combat paired with powerful loot all at a crazy affordable price? There's not much more you could ask for in an epic dungeon crawling ARPG.

For most players though the sweet spot will be with Minecraft Dungeons: Hero Edition. For $30 on every platform (although the PS4 edition can often be found for less) players will get everything Minecraft Dungeons has to offer a handful of cosmetic items to customize their characters and the first two expansions that launched for Minecraft Dungeons: Jungle Awakens and Creeping Winter.

For what's still half the price of most modern games the Hero Edition of Minecraft Dungeons gives a solid amount of content that can keep you occupied for hours on end. For those who love physical discs Minecraft Dungeons: Hero Edition is the only version of Minecraft Dungeons that comes as a physical copy. If you already own the base game or play Minecraft Dungeons through Xbox Game Pass you can purchase the Hero Pass separately for $10. The Hero Pass includes all the additional content from the Hero Edition.

Minecraft Dungeons+ Minecraft Dungeons: Hero Edition $20 at Amazon (PlayStation) $30 at Amazon (Switch) The real base version of Minecraft Dungeons.

Minecraft Dungeons has a base version but the edition most players should be considering when purchasing Minecraft Dungeons is the Hero Edition. Minecraft Dungeons: Hero Edition includes a ton of content at a still-great price and is only getting better with time as updates are released. Players can decide if they want to take it farther with more expansions.

Finally we come to what's decidedly the ""next stage"" for Minecraft Dungeons. The two expansions promised with the Hero Edition of Minecraft Dungeons have already arrived but Mojang Studios is far from done releasing brand-new content for their dungeon-crawling ARPG. Now players who are truly invested in getting the most out of Mojang Studios' newest game have the Minecraft Dungeons Season Pass to consider.

The Season Pass is $20 on every platform the same price as Minecraft Dungeons by itself so it's certainly an investment. However the Season Pass includes the next four expansions for Minecraft Dungeons across four brand-new areas and is evident of Mojang Studios' long-term commitment to their game.

Right now the Season Pass already includes one released expansion with Howling Peaks which is about the same size as previous expansions that have come before it. The next expansion coming in the Season Pass is Flames of the Nether and is nearly an entire game by itself featuring at least twice as much content as any expansion that has come before it. The free update launching alongside Flames of the Nether will also add an astronomical amount of endgame content to Minecraft Dungeons' base version.

There are still two more expansions that have yet to be properly announced for Minecraft Dungeons' Season Pass. Still if they're at least as big as Howling Peaks in scale then the Season Pass will be an incredible value addition for Minecraft Dungeons and save you a pretty penny over buying the expansions separately. If you've already played Minecraft Dungeons and love what the game has to offer the Season Pass is definitely worth your consideration.

Minecraft Dungeons is at its best when played with friends so make sure you're able to communicate effectively and hear every word with one of the Best Headsets for Xbox Series X|S which have been carefully selected as the best at what they do.

It's been a busy first year for Minecraft Dungeons and now the ARPG dungeon-crawling Minecraft spin-off is looking ahead towards its future with four new expansions planned. The first one Howling Peaks is available right now but players can also grab the new Season Pass to gain immediate access to all four expansions as soon as they launch.

Most of the models in this series come with a mop attachment (in addition to the vacuum) that does a remarkably good job while also allowing you to fit far more dirt and debris in a small 0.44L bin by compressing it. There’s no need to wall mount the device as its charging station is free standing with space for multiple attachments to be stored and it ships with two batteries in the box. The only thing the A9 Kompressor can’t compete with Dyson is its unbalanced weight.

Two-minute review

The handstick vacuum market is becoming a very crowded place and LG is keen to give Dyson a run for its money with its range of CordZero A9 Kompressor vacuum cleaners. Other than the base model in the A9 Kompressor series all the other models come with a mopping attachment – something you’re not going to get with any Dyson vacuum cleaner.

The convenience of having a handstick that can both vacuum and mop is immense and the best part about LG’s Power Drive Mop attachment is it allows you to do both at the same time – it sucks in from the front and spits out water from the back. And while some hard caked-in dirt might require some elbow grease to get them off your hard floors we found the LG A9 Kompressor capable of handling most tasks except for the hardiest of grime.

Another thing that’s quite impressive about the A9 Kompressor is the battery life: while LG promises that you’ll get up to 60 minutes of power per charge per battery (it ships with two in the box) in normal mode we actually squeezed out about 75 minutes from one battery and a little over 70 minutes from the second. Even on Turbo Mode (where the suction power is higher) we got an impressive 27 minutes of battery life from a full charge.

Conveniently LG’s handsticks have a free-standing charging base (unlike Dyson’s wall mount-only option) which means you don’t need to drill holes in your wall to store the vacuum. The stand also has space for your regularly-used attachments (up to three) including any Power Drive head and the mop pads.

Another big convenience is the Kompressor technology that the handsticks are named after. Push down on a lever on the outside of the bin and it can compact dirt and debris allowing you to fit 2.4 times as much into the 0.44L bin.

Like the older CordZero A9 range of handsticks LG has integrated its ThinQ technology into the A9 Kompressor range as well. This allows you to keep tabs on the health of the device including its filter the life of the attachments and a cleaning history via a companion app. While this information may be useful to some we found it quite unnecessary and didn’t use the app once after the initial setup.

The only thing that made us dock that half star in this review is the overall weight distribution of the A9 Kompressor. The handheld main unit feels heavier than a Dyson handstick and the LG can feel quite unbalanced when you’re maneuvering it around the house and it’s difficult to hold the unit up for more than a few minutes at a time if you’re clearing cobwebs from the ceiling. Moreover the rotating mop pads also generate some force which can push the handstick at angles instead of a steady straight path. It requires a relatively tight grip that can be tiring on the arm muscles and a little time to get used to.

LG CordZero A9 Kompressor: price and availability

Not available in all markets

Expensive

There are four models in the LG CordZero A9 Kompressor range and the main difference between them are the attachments they ship with and the color scheme used in the design. They range from $699 / AU$1099 for the base model (called A9K Core in Australia) and $799 / AU$1299 for the Ultra model. The base model is the only one that doesn’t have mopping capabilities.

That’s in no way cheap especially since there are Shark and Bissell vacuum mops that are cheaper but they’re not available widely. Similarly LG hasn’t taken its handstick range to all markets – they’re currently available to buy in the US and Australia but aren’t listed on LG’s UK website.

Design

Free-standing charging station

Dustbin compacts dirt

Very useful mop attachment

Cordless handsticks aren’t new and LG has stuck to a familiar design that most people would be instantly familiar with. What sets the CordZero A9 Kompressor apart from is main rival Dyson is the free-standing charging station. It comes in several pieces that you’ll need to assemble (and might need to consult the manual to get that done) but what we really liked about the charging station is the cable management option at the rear of the vertical piece and the spots available to store your regularly used tools. The charging station can also be wall mounted but good to know you have a choice.

As we mentioned the A9 Kompressor handsticks come with two batteries and the dock has been designed to top up the spare battery while you’re using the vacuum with the other one. Below the clips for storing the handstick is a niche with charging plates for the second battery pack.

All four A9 Kompressor models ship with the Multi-Surface Power Drive Nozzle plus the Combination and Crevice tools and there’s space to store these on the charging station itself. Beyond that each A9 Kompressor model has a different combination of additional tools and Power Drive cleaning heads – the easiest way to distinguish between them all is the color of the handstick.

We were sent the purple model (Vintage Wine as LG calls it) in the A9 Kompressor series which comes with an additional Hard Floor Power Drive Nozzle the Power Drive Mop and two additional tools for hard dirt and upholstery. That’s a pretty versatile kit allowing you to clean pretty much any surface with the additional benefit of being able to mop the floor as well.

(Image credit: TechRadar)

So let’s dive right into the Power Drive Mop. This is the largest cleaning head in the box – on top is a transparent grey ‘tank’ and on the underside is a pair of rotating discs with Velcro. The top tank pops right off with the push of a button and can be filled through an opening on the side. The clamp for the tank seemed to be drip-proof during our testing. Two pairs of round mops come in the box – one soft the other a little rough for ‘polishing’ the floor. All you have to do is choose a matching pair wet them wring them out and stick ‘em onto the Velcro discs. With water in the tank you’re ready to go.

The good thing about the Power Drive Mop is there’s a suction hole in the front as well. If you just need to mop then normal power is what you need but if you’d like to vacuum and mop as you go – like we did as it saved us a huge amount of time every time we used the handstick – then bump up to Turbo power and dirt debris and stains are gone in the one cleaning run.

You can even choose how often you want water to be sprayed during mopping with two settings to choose from – a spray every eight seconds or a spray every six seconds.

(Image credit: TechRadar)

Another interesting thing about the A9 Kompressor range is the amount of dirt it can hold in the relatively small 0.44L bin. There’s a compressor inside the bin that can be pushed down via a lever on the outside. If the bin is full just press down on the lever a few times and the dirt and hair inside will be compacted freeing up more space. That means you empty the bin less often and that’s perfect for large spaces.

There are three different filters that are removable and washable making the A9 Kompressor less expensive to maintain in the long run. In fact an extra pre-filter (accessible by removing the front panel of the main handheld unit) is available in the box.

Everything else on the LG handstick is self-explanatory with all the controls within easy reach of your thumb. And here again LG has done one better than Dyson – instead of holding down a power button (trigger in the case of Dyson) through the duration of the cleaning process you only need to switch the power button on and leave it be. It was our main complaint with Dyson handsticks as it can cause pain in the wrist.

If you need to increase suction power pressing the Turbo button once ups it from Normal to Power mode and another press takes it from Power to Turbo mode and the maximum suction.

You can connect the handstick to your home’s Wi-Fi network with just a press of a button on the front of the handle but we found it quite unnecessary. You’ll only need it if you’d like to use the app which is handy to keep tabs on when you should wash the filter and how much cleaning you’ve done. We did set up the app but never felt the need to use it.

Handling

Heavy

Feels unbalanced

Power Drive Mop pulls handstick in angles

This is where we have our one and only complaint with the LG A9 Kompressor handstick – it feels heavy. Weighing in at 2.7kg with the telescopic tube and Multi-Surface Power Drive Nozzle attached it’s 100g heavier than a Dyson V10 and lighter than the 3.5kg Dyson V11 Outsize but the weight distribution feels wrong.

Where a Dyson feels well balanced the A9 Kompressor doesn’t. All the weight feels concentrated on the main handheld unit and puts a little pressure on the arm muscles. It also makes it difficult to hold aloft if you’d like to get to cobwebs in the ceiling.

Added to that there’s additional gruntwork needed when using the Power Drive Mop. The two mop discs rotate in opposite directions but the force they produce doesn’t ‘drive’ the vacuum straight ahead instead directing it at slight angles. While mopping you’ll occasionally feel the handstick getting away from you the moment you loosen your grip and that will instinctively make you tighten your hold on the handle and potentially cause muscle tiredness. It’s not debilitating in any way but it will take some getting used to.

Cleaning performance

Powerful suction

Excellent mopping capabilities

Very versatile

Despite the heft to the handstick the LG A9 Kompressor is an excellent investment especially the models that come with the mopping attachment. The Multi-Surface cleaning head hardly ever gets hair tangled with its bristles and the Hard Floor Nozzle does a very good job on well hard floors. It’s far better at handling larger debris than the Multi-Surface Nozzle but it did have a little trouble with some cornflakes on the floor.

A half-inch piece of a plastic bag needed a few tries to get sucked up with either nozzle but some perseverance paid off. So while the A9 Kompressor might struggle a little with larger debris its everyday cleaning prowess is excellent.

In Normal suction mode carpets are hair free in a couple of sweeps while the Turbo mode will definitely see it in tip-top shape. Impressively it’s one of the few cordless vacuum cleaners we’ve tested that gave us a whopping 70 minutes of fade-free suction in Normal mode and a very admirable 27 minutes in Turbo. That’s far more than what LG advertises. And given there’s two batteries at your disposal you can easily get a large family home cleaned and then some!

Mopping hard floors occasionally requires some elbow grease especially if you’ve got little kids or pets. Since we had neither to determine whether the A9 Kompressor’s mop could handle tough jobs we let our test space get as messy as possible over a two-week period after our initial vacuuming tests. There was caked-in stains on the kitchen floor footprints in the bathroom and plenty of hair and dust in the rest of the house. And boy were we impressed.

Instead of running a quick vacuum-only session before the mop we dived straight into a vacuum+mop run (by setting the power mode to Turbo) over this dirty floor and the A9 handled it well. Admittedly we needed to go over some spots a few times but at the end our floor was practically spotless. Just one little grimy spot refused to budge on our kitchen floor and this was with the softer mops.

The rougher ones do a better job on caked-in stains but again there are some things that will always require you to go down on your hands and knees. It should be noted that the rough mops are smaller and you’ll find a dry strip at the center of each sweep. So you will need to go over each stretch of room a couple of times (or more) but the results are quite good.

And the A9 Kompressor does all this without making too much noise. We found that in Normal mode the A9 Kompressor was a little quieter than the Dyson V7 and V8 handsticks and when just mopping there’s only a low hum.

Should I buy a LG CordZero A9 Kompressor handstick

(Image credit: TechRadar)

Buy it if...

You need a vacuum mop Use it as a regular handstick vacuum cleaner a handheld one or even as a mop (heck use it as a vacuum+mop) the A9 Kompressor is versatile. It will be a little hard to get to ceiling corners because of the weight distribution but if the job is a small quick one you should be able to manage just fine.

You live in a large family home With two battery packs in the box – something Dyson doesn’t yet offer with its handsticks – you can clean a large space and possibly still have some power left over. You can charge one battery while using the other meaning no job needs to be incomplete – just briefly interrupted if you need to swap out the batteries.

You need a vacuum cleaner with a large-capacity bin Admittedly the A9 Kompressor’s bin capacity is nothing to write home about but that 0.44L barrel can fit 2.4 times the amount thanks to a compactor inside that will compress the dirt and hair inside.

Don't buy it if...

The CEO and chief investment officer of the explosively popular active management firm told CNBC this week that the cryptocurrency's catalysts are adding up as it soars to unprecedented new highs.

""I think the probability of an ETF has gone up"" Wood told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" in a sweeping interview on Wednesday.

With Gary Gensler — a longtime financier who taught a digital currency class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — being nominated to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission the watchdog could warm to crypto during the Biden administration Wood said.

""I think we have individuals now involved who really understand the space and I think the likelihood has gone up"" for a U.S.-based bitcoin ETF.

Purpose Investments gained approval for the first-ever physically backed bitcoin ETF in Canada this week. The fund began trading on Thursday.

Now that U.S. corporations including Ark Invest favorite Tesla are adding bitcoin to their balance sheets its potential for profits has exponentially grown Wood said.

""We expected institutional interest to pick up this year and it certainly has but the way in which it's picked up has surprised us"" she said. ""I don't think we ever thought there would be broad-based substitution of bitcoin for cash on corporate balance sheets so we find that very interesting.""

Tesla revealed a $1.5 billion bet on bitcoin through SEC filings earlier this month. Several other major players in the U.S. market including BlackRock Mastercard and Square have also announced moves into the space.

""If all corporations in the United States were to put ...10% of their cash into bitcoin that alone would add $200000 to the bitcoin price"" Wood said. ""Now we obviously do not believe this is going to happen very quickly. We're talking about maybe the equivalent of [a] $900 billion market cap.""

Bitcoin's market value cracked $1 trillion on Friday according to digital currency news site Coindesk.

""This has to mature a little bit before broad-based adoption can take place but we're very reassured that companies like Square and Tesla have chosen to allocate"" Wood said Wednesday.

Further 25% already own crypto with another 27% saying they plan to invest this year.

That’s according to a February survey of 30000 people over the age of 18 conducted by Piplsay a global consumer research platform. The findings fall roughly in line with other recent surveys.

In October Grayscale found that 55% of U.S. investors were interested in buying crypto. While Bitwise found 24% of financial advisers already owned bitcoin or some other crypto in a survey published in January. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group.)

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has put it among the top-performing assets of the last year and the past decade. This strong performance has attracted institutional players from MassMutual to BlackRock and MicroStrategy to Tesla though some argue that retail interest has not kept pace.

Google searches for “bitcoin” an adequate proxy for public interest have yet to reach levels seen in 2017 the previous crypto market bullrun.

Piplsay found that 41% of respondents think the stock market and cryptocurrencies are equally risky investments. Of those that believe cryptocurrency is not a safe investment 27% were concerned about hacking or fraud 22% about a lack of regulations and 20% crypto’s volatility.

is further shaking up its executive ranks. David McCormick the hedge fund's CEO announced the changes in a February 11 memo to staff.

Bridgewater was battered in 2020 losing about $12 billion as other funds found great success.

The largest hedge fund is shuffling its top ranks again.

Bridgewater Associates has appointed Nir Bar Dea to the newly created role of deputy chief executive CEO David McCormick announced in an email to staff on February 11 which he published on LinkedIn Friday.

Among other changes to the fund's investment committee and other operating groups Chief Operating Officer Brian Kreiter is leaving the firm McCormick said. Founder and Chairman Ray Dalio will remain in his roles and ""continue to serve as a mentor across functions"" he added.

Dalio 71 founded Bridgewater in 1975 and has largely overseen its growth to more than $140 billion in assets under management easily making it the largest hedge fund. He has taken a less active role in recent years appointing his first co-CEO Eileen Murray in 2011. Dalio relinquished his co-CEO title in 2017 in favor of an advisory role.

Murray who left Bridgewater in 2020 had since been involved in a dispute with the firm over deferred pay. That lawsuit ended ""amicably and fairly"" in a settlement in October a Bridgewater spokesperson previously told Insider.

It's not clear when - if ever - Dalio will completely leave the firm. According to McCormick's memo Dalio ""has agreed to stay deeply involved in our investment team as both an idea generator and mentor.""

Bridgewater has been hammered amid stock-market volatility during the coronavirus pandemic. The fund lost $12.1 billion in 2020 even as other firms found great success.

""We have learned and innovated a lot over the last year across the firm"" McCormick said in his memo. ""There is much about our processes and systems that is great but there are areas that need to improve and evolve. In order to achieve this right mix we need to continue our transformation across a number of different dimensions to ensure we successfully manage our portfolios serve our clients excellently and operate Bridgewater in a world-class manner.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFyZ3VzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMTkxMDM2MDIuc3dpbW1pbmctYmxhY2stcm9jay10aGlydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swimming at Black Rock in the Thirties,"This great Argus archive picture shows the Black Rock pool in its heyday in 1937 with crowds of happy swimmers enjoying a day out.

With Maui County support the primary purpose of the summit was to lay the groundwork for Hawaii to attract sustainable investment that aligns with community values.

The event was part of locally based Responsible Markets’ Maui ESG Project. ESG stands for “Environmental Social and Corporate Governance.” Investors are increasingly taking ESG factors into consideration when they make decisions.

In 2020 30% of U.S. assets under management — $17 trillion — were allocated to ESG. That figure is up 42% from just two years ago according to research from the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.

Summit speakers included a mix of ESG experts community leaders and citizens. The summit was unique in bringing the community together with people who directly invest large amounts of capital in the local economy. Discussions were collaborative and informative.

During his panel Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs discussed the $31 billion in state and local government funds and savings plans that his office manages. He spoke about integrating investment objectives like optimal risk-adjusted returns with corporate accountability and sustainability factors such as sound corporate governance diversity and inclusion and environmental care.

Kehau Filimoeatu retired from the Maui Police Department gave her perspective as a beneficiary of the Hawaii Employees’ Retirement System. The ERS provides retirement and other benefits to 135000 Hawaii public employees has $18 billion in assets under management and invests in over 800 companies including Facebook Amazon and Microsoft.

Reminding the audience that the money that the ERS manages comes from the wages of teachers firefighters and police officers Filimoeatu talked about managing pension fund investments from an ahupuaa perspective: Improper diversion of water upstream affects all of us downstream and if the ahupuaa is not cared for it will not sustain future generations.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat

To look at investment through the lens of the ahupuaa system makes sense. In olelo Hawaii wai means water and waiwai means wealth. Even in the western world water is used as a metaphor for finance with terms like “cash flow” “liquidity” “trickle-down” “channeling investment.” We even use water metaphors when we’re talking about a lack of investment when capital “dries up.”

Making The Metaphor A Reality

Now as we address the impacts that COVID-19 has had on Hawaii we need to support investments that truly sustain our residents their children and grandchildren. We need investments that — both metaphorically and in reality — keep the ahupuaa healthy.

One of the most important levers that we have at our disposal is the global capital market. For a sustainable equitable future we need transparency and accountability from our financial institutions. For example key institutional investors are moving to drop fossil fuel investment — with New York’s $226 billion pension fund announcing in December its plans to divest.

Yet in the years since the 2015 signing of the Paris Climate Agreement global banks still provided $2.7 trillion in financing to fossil fuels and investors are not yet putting sufficient capital into much needed clean energy and resilience projects.

In 2018 the Hawaii ERS became a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles of Responsible Investment which is designed to support and encourage responsible and sustainable investment practices.

Becoming a PRI signatory was a good first step but Hawaii’s retirement system needs to do much more. For example we know that ERS is still invested in fossil fuels.

And while the ERS may have reasons for staying invested at this time beneficiaries at least deserve to know the reasoning behind such a decision how the pension system is planning for the clean energy transition as well as what risks and exposures ERS has to climate change.

Public state funds need to show how they are putting sustainable investment principles into action. They must demonstrate how they are going to support the sustainable economy — and not endanger our future through investments that are harmful and present clear economic risks.

That is why I introduced House Bill 1205 (Sen. Sharon Moriwaki introduced the Senate Companion Senate Bill 801). The bill currently before the Economic Development Committee in the House and the Government Operations Committee in the Senate asks the ERS and other state-managed funds to integrate sustainable investing into their practices and processes and to report back to the community on how sustainably these assets are being managed.

While ERS does currently submit an annual report on its ESG activities to the PRI little information about its ESG activities is made available to members of the public — including ERS pension beneficiaries and Hawaii taxpayers.

Besides environmental concerns the PRI principles include the “S” and the “G” in ESG. “Social care” includes issues related to worker rights and culture as well as other social concerns and “Governance” refers to how a corporation is managed including ethics.

Environmental Social And Corporate Governance On The Ground

An example of an investment by Hawaii’s pension fund that some of my constituents contend does not meet ESG standards is a $30.5 million allocation to the Blackstone Group. The world’s largest private equity manager New York-based Blackstone has $619 billion in assets under management. In 2019 founder and CEO Steve Schwarzman who has an estimated net worth of $23.1 billion took home $802 million in compensation.

A Blackstone fund in which the ERS is invested owns the Grand Wailea and Ritz-Carlton Kapalua and is Maui’s largest private employer. The Grand Wailea is the largest customer of Maui’s Department of Water Supply.

Blackstone states that ESG factors are an important part of its investment process: “ESG principles have always been at the core of our business – we’ve spent years promoting sustainability across our portfolio prioritizing our people and practicing good governance.”

Yet community members have expressed grave concerns about how the Grand Wailea is operating under Blackstone. There are questions concerning the environment management of resources and shoreline erosion. More broadly the private capital hotel ownership model further ties the overall Hawaiian economy to tourism with profits largely going back to Blackstone.

Though most people on Maui do not have access to Schwarzman and indeed many likely have not heard of him it is clear that he has an important role in our community. And through the ERS many Hawaii residents have invested their hard-earned wages in his funds.

Investing in Blackstone has broader ramifications too. According to the Washington Post Schwarzman has been one of former President Trump’s steadiest supporters.

Here we come to the G of governance. In the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection political donations are being looked at more closely. As Ahupuaa Summit panelist Treasurer Frerichs states: “We’re going to investigate and ask questions of our fund managers. Are their giving patterns destabilizing our government which would lead to the destabilization of our country?”

HB 1205 And SB 801

Whether the issues relate to the climate crisis hotel development or an attack on our democracy we need Hawaii’s pension fund to adhere to the PRI principles: incorporating ESG into analysis and decision-making; seeking appropriate disclosure on ESG by the entities in which it invests; and reporting on activities and progress toward implementing the principles.

Opponents to HB 1205 and SB 801 will say that our economy is too damaged to stand up to the further risk of ensuring that our investments consider the environment social outcomes and governance. Or that somehow we cannot afford or do not deserve full accountability and transparency from our public funds.

I say we must act before we lose more money take more unnecessary risks and waste more time committing capital to ventures that make our economy and community unsafe.

Any true definition of sustainable investment must also include consideration of the entire public fund system which includes knowing how much of our funds are being paid out in fees and how much money is being lost in revenues in the form of tax breaks and other subsidies that private equity and other money managers receive.

That is why HB 1205 asks the ERS to report both on the fees it pays to managers and the net economic impact of private market investments made in Hawaii. We need to know how our pension money is being invested in our local economy and to be sure those investments adhere to true ESG guidelines.

We also need to know what kind of tax breaks and other benefits investment firms get when they invest in our community and profit from our resources.

We give up nothing when our public funds are invested ethically and responsibly. And we gain back the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbW9hb2JzZXJ2ZXIud3MvY2F0ZWdvcnkvYXJ0aWNsZS83OTU5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone Resources presents new achievements of,"BAAR Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb 19 2021--

Blackstone Resources AG Baar (SWX: BLS) is pleased to announce a number of important achievements by its subsidiary Blackstone Technology during its Blackstone’s Battery Day held on February 16 2021. Blackstone Technology GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of Blackstone Resources AG and is based in Döbeln Saxony Germany. It represents Blackstone’s Resources battery technology division.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210219005415/en/

Blackstone Technology CEO Holger Gritzka

During the Battery Day Blackstone Technology CEO Holger Gritzka presented a new 3D printed lithium-ion battery cell produced with its own proprietary patented technology whose manufacturing process is ecologically friendly and offers superior performance compared to current battery technology.

Developing new battery technology is complex which is why a significant amount has been invested to build the foundations that will allow Blackstone Technology to deliver this next generation of battery cell technology and in addition the solid state technology. This is why Blackstone Technology is constructing state-of-the-art battery manufacturing facilities in Döbeln Saxony which was where the Battery Day was held. During the presentation he presented a preseries production sample cell which Blackstone Technology will bring into production at these manufacturing facilities this summer.

During the event he went through the preparations being made at these new manufacturing facilities. He stressed the importance that the next generation of batteries made at these facilities should be based on a clean and sustainable type of technology. This means for instance using electrodes that are not toxic and damaging to the environment. He also highlighted how important it was that the battery materials used should be sourced ethically and in a sustainable manner. Blackstone Resources may deliver battery metals from their own sources such as lithium from Chile.

The type of battery Mr Gritzka presented today was based on LFP technology. This battery that has a cathode based on lithium iron phosphate (LFP). The benefit of using this technology is that it is inexpensive and does not require cobalt or nickel. Other combinations with other metals like NMC batteries are planned.

He also explained that no toxic materials are used with these batteries – only water. Although LFP technology typically has a lower energy density in comparison to other battery chemistries the Blackstone’s proprietary thick-layer technology that is used at Blackstone Technology cancels out these disadvantages. In fact the LFP battery technology presented offers 20-25% more energy density compared to current lithium-ion battery technology.

This is thanks to the proprietary 3D-printing manufacturing process used at Blackstone Technology. This same printing technology also means that batteries can be produced in various form factors. It can be used for instance for many applications such as for EV electric buses  electric motorcycles 5G networks tools or for drone technology.

Blackstone Technology also announced its goal is to achieve an energy density of more than 220 Watts per hour per kilogram in the pre-production and in series production. The plan is to bring this highly competitive product to the market by the summer of 2021. The company has already held talks with a number of customers who would like to use the batteries produced by Blackstone Technology in their products.

The final project that Mr Gritzka talked about involves the electrification of ships in the future. Blackstone Technology was selected by the European Commission CURRENT DIRECT as part of a consortium of 13 other companies to help deliver this vision. One part of the project is a hybrid drive which will sail ships into a harbour electrically and then out again using the same technology. This same technology could also be used as a pure electric drive used in fairies. Next spring Blackstone Technology will provide 10000 battery cells for this EU project.

By Brian Freeman. (Blackstone Publishing 354 pages. $16.99.)

Things are usually pretty quiet in the small forested town of Avery Weir a place so hidden away that most folks call it Everywhere in the middle of nowhere.

Our narrator is Shelby Lake a young woman who was left on the sheriff's doorstep as an infant. The kindly sheriff adopted her naming her after his favorite fishing lake and has raised her with the hopes that she would take over the sheriff's office one day. Now 25 and a deputy Shelby is trading banter with her co-workers when the sheriff gets a call: A 10-year-old boy is missing.

The only sign Jeremiah Sloan has left behind is his bike on the side of a forest road. As the search intensifies we meet a townful of characters — some quirky some lovable some ominous — and every one of them including Shelby is hiding a secret.

Even with the FBI's help there is no sign of Jeremiah. Suspicion lands on a number of people but the case goes cold over the coming months. The boy's heartbroken family falls apart. Then 10 years later there is a break. Someone has found one of Jeremiah's possessions in a most unlikely place and the mystery ramps right back up to the incredible pace where it left off.

The ties between these characters are deep because no one leaves Everywhere for long. They all come back sharing decades of memories relationships grudges and regrets. Every character that St. Paul-based author Brian Freeman introduces has a part in this complicated plot.

The sheriff is fighting advancing Alzheimer's Shelby keeps seeing omens of snowy owls leading to turns in the case and a young woman now in Shelby's care is going through a perilous spell with drugs and alcohol.

Even with the heavy subject matter this book is a delight to read. The dialogue is crisp and natural. The storytelling seems unflawed with the tiniest of breadcrumbs from one chapter suddenly resurfacing and making their purpose known.

""The Deep Deep Snow"" is one to share with friends to recommend for book clubs or to stash away for a second reading down the road. It's just that good.",,,,,,

Airlines in the United States South Korea and Japan have grounded dozens of Boeing 777 aircraft after one of the jets suffered engine failure Saturday sending debris crashing down over Denver.

Boeing (BA) on Sunday recommended that airlines stop flying versions of the aircraft that are equipped with Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines while US authorities investigate the Denver incident.

The plane manufacturer said that 69 of the 777 jets that are in service are powered by the engine while 59 such aircraft are in storage.

United Airlines (UAL) Korean Air Asiana Airlines All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines (JAPSY) all use Boeing 777s that feature Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines.

The groundings come after an engine attached to a United-operated 777 plane failed Saturday just minutes after the Honolulu-bound flight took off from Denver International Airport. As United Flight 328 returned to the airport it dropped more engine debris through the roofs of homes and into yards.

An initial examination of the Pratt & Whitney PW4077 engine from that flight showed that two fan blades were fractured according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agency said that the remaining blades exhibited damage “to the tips and leading edges.”

The findings are preliminary but they were still enough to spur some airlines to pull planes that use those types of engines from service. The NTSB said that it will examine the engine airline and photos and videos taken by passengers on board the flight along with the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.

Investigators believe a fan blade in the engine came off and took out another blade a source familiar with the situation told CNN.

Grounded flights

United said Sunday that it would immediately pull 24 planes from flying “out of an abundance of caution.” The company said its move was voluntary and temporary and should disrupt only “a small number of customers.”

Japan’s transportation ministry meanwhile said that it had ordered All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines to ground planes using that series of engines. The ministry said that order applied to 19 Boeing 777s at All Nippon Airways and 13 at Japan Airlines that have Prat & Whitney 4000 engines.

South Korea’s Asiana Airlines which owns nine of the planes said it would stop using them too.

The jets are also used by Korean Air which on Tuesday said it would ground the planes. The airline has six of the jets in service while 10 are in storage.

According to the most recent registry data the only airlines that operate with the affected engines are in the United States Japan and South Korea. United is the only US operator with this type of engine in its fleet.

Ongoing investigation

Both Boeing and Pratt & Whitney have said they are cooperating with the US investigation into the Denver incident.

“We are pleased to hear that United Airlines flight 328 returned safely to Denver” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing technical advisers are supporting the US National Transportation Safety Board with its investigation.”

Pratt & Whitney — a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies (RTN) — said it has sent a team to work with investigators looking into the engine failure.

“Pratt & Whitney is actively coordinating with operators and regulators to support the revised inspection interval” of the 4000 engines that power certain 777s” the company said adding that “any further investigative updates regarding this event will be at the discretion of the NTSB.”

The US Federal Aviation Administration on Sunday also issued an emergency order saying it would be stepping up inspections of 777s that use certain Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines.

“We reviewed all available safety data following [the] incident” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. “Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.”

Boeing said carriers using 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines should suspend operations until full inspections could be carried out after the United Airlines jet was forced to make an emergency landing having scattered debris over residential areas in Denver.

On Monday the UK banned all 777s with the same engines from entering its airspace. The transport secretary Grant Shapps said he would “continue to work closely with the Civil Aviation Authority to monitor the situation”.

The engine on flight 328 from Denver to Honolulu failed shortly after takeoff on Saturday with 231 passengers and 10 crew onboard. Pilots issued a mayday call and returned to Denver.

Police expressed astonishment that no one had been killed or injured on the ground after large pieces of debris landed near houses and in public parks. The entire front casing of the engine appeared to have landed in front of a house in Broomfield Colorado.

Five airlines worldwide operate the 777 model using Pratt & Whitney engines. No UK carriers use that configuration. The 777-200s and 300s affected are older and less fuel-efficient than the models used by most operators including British Airways whose 59 777s do not have the Pratt & Whitney engines.

United Airlines said it was temporarily grounding all 24 of its Boeing 777s in current service. Japan’s aviation regulator told Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) which between them operate 32 planes of the affected model to ground their planes. South Korea home to the remaining carriers said it was monitoring the situation.

Boeing said 69 of the planes were in service and 59 in storage as a result of lack of demand during the coronavirus pandemic.

The US Federal Aviation Administration had issued an emergency directive to require immediate or enhanced inspections of similar 777 models to the one involved in the Denver incident before Boeing went further to urge that the planes were grounded.

The US manufacturer has faced intense scrutiny over its safety record since the 737 Max disasters in Indonesia and Ethiopia in which a total of 346 people died. The 737 Max has only returned to service in the past two months almost two years after being grounded.

Initial examination of the Denver 777 engine showed that two fan blades had fractured accorded to the US National Transportation Safety Board. Flight data recorders have been taken to a lab in Washington for analysis.

A malfunction with the same engine forced a JAL internal flight to return to Naha in December Japan’s transport ministry revealed on Monday on a 777 of the same age as the Denver plane.

The incident also appears similar to an emergency that occurred on another 777 operated by United three years ago when the cowling of the right-hand engine was blown off 45 minutes before landing in Honolulu. US investigators found two fan blades had fractured with the fragments flying out of the engine and puncturing the fuselage.

A further engine failure occurred at the weekend on a Boeing 747 cargo plane in the Netherlands. Dutch authorities are investigating after parts fell from the engine shortly after the plane took off from Maastricht for New York on Saturday.

The plane also using a Pratt & Whitney engine – a smaller version of the PW4000 model according to Reuters – made an emergency landing at Liège in Belgium. The engine had caught fire witnesses said and scattered small metal parts over the southern Dutch town of Meerssen damaging cars and slightly injuring one woman according to local media reports.

Pratt & Whitney which is owned by Raytheon Technologies said after the United flight that it was “actively coordinating with operators and regulators to support the revised inspection interval” of its engines for the 777.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZhYS10by1pc3N1ZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktb3JkZXItcmVxdWlyaW5nLWltbWVkaWF0ZS1vci1zdGVwcGVkLXVwLWluc3BlY3Rpb25zLW9mLWJvZWluZy03NzdzLXdpdGgtY2VydGFpbi1wcmF0dC13aGl0bmV5LXB3NDAwMC1lbmdpbmVz0gGtAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZmFhLXRvLWlzc3VlLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1vcmRlci1yZXF1aXJpbmctaW1tZWRpYXRlLW9yLXN0ZXBwZWQtdXAtaW5zcGVjdGlvbnMtb2YtYm9laW5nLTc3N3Mtd2l0aC1jZXJ0YWluLXByYXR0LXdoaXRuZXktcHc0MDAwLWVuZ2luZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAA demands emergency inspection of select Boeing 777s after midair explosion ripped engine into pieces,"Federal Aviation Administration administrator Steve Dickson has ordered the agency's aviation safety experts to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring ""immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines.""

""This will likely mean that some airplanes will be removed from service"" Dickson said in a statement posted to Twitter.

According to the FAA aviation safety experts are meeting into the evening with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing to finalize the details of the order and any accompanying service bulletins in order to ensure that the appropriate airplanes are included. Exact details of the inspection will be specified in the emergency order.

Dickson added that the agency is ""working closely with other civil aviation authorities to make this information available to affected operators in their jurisdictions.”

UNITED FLIGHT'S ENGINE CATCHES FIRE AFTER DENVER TAKEOFF RETURNS TO AIRPORT SAFELY

The move comes in response to United Airlines flight 328 which experienced an engine failure after taking off from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The airplane landed safely after dropping debris over northern Colorado officials said.

The Boeing 777 was heading from Denver to Honolulu with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard when its right engine failed and erupted in flames. The plane quickly lost altitude and dropped huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass onto the neighborhoods below. Authorities said no injuries were reported aboard the plane or on the ground where debris fell.

""We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident"" Dickson said. ""Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Boeing said in a statement that it is ""actively monitoring recent events related to United Airlines Flight 328"" and that while an investigation into the incident by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway it recommends ""suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines until the FAA identifies the appropriate inspection protocol.""

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a Sunday evening investigation update that an intitial examination indicated that the airplane sustained minor damage most of which was ""confined to the number 2 engine.""

Investigators noted that the inlet a duct which is required to ensure smooth airflow into the engine and a cowling the removable metal covering that houses the engine were separated from the engine. In addition two fan blades were fractured while the remainder of the blades exhibited damage to their tips and leading edges.

The NTSB added that investigators continue to examine the engine airplane and the photographs and video taken by passengers aboard United flight 328 and that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were transported to the agency's laboratory in Washington where each will be downloaded and analyzed.

According to the most recent registry data airlines in only three countries operate airplanes with the affected engines: the United States Japan and South Korea. United Airlines the only U.S. operator with this type of engine in its fleet said it would ground the affected planes immediately.

""Starting immediately and out of an abundance of caution we are voluntarily and temporarily removing 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from our schedule. Since yesterday we’ve been in touch with regulators at the NTSB and FAA and will continue to work closely with them to determine any additional steps that are needed to ensure these aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards and can return to service"" a United spokesperson told FOX Business in a statement.

Rahal Letterman Lanigan-Honda’s Takuma Sato won the 104th running of the Indy 500 after a tense duel with Chip Ganassi Racing’s Scott Dixon in the closing stages of the race was cut short by a yellow flag while the Japanese driver held off the long-time leader and 2008 winner.

For both Sato and RLL it was a second win in the Greatest Spectacle in Racing but their first together. The team co-owned by Bobby Rahal David Letterman and Mike Lanigan triumphed with Buddy Rice in 2004 while Sato won for Andretti Autosport in 2017.

Sato is one of just 20 drivers to win the race at least twice in its 104 editions.

The Borg-Warner Trophy unveiling came 100 days before the scheduled 105th Indianapolis 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Joining Sato in person in the ceremony were Rahal and Lanigan BorgWarner global director of marketing and PR Michelle Collins and IMS president Doug Boles.

Both Letterman and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Koji Tomita saluted Sato via video messages.

Sato’s image was created by sculptor William Behrends who has crafted the sterling silver bas relief images of all winners for the trophy since 1990.

“I am thrilled to once again have my face become a permanent fixture on the Borg-Warner Trophy” Sato said. “William’s work is extraordinary and it is amazing how much detail he can fit into the sterling silver sculptures.

“The effort he puts into making each individual winners’ personality and character is quite special and it was an honor to experience this thorough and remarkable process once again.”

Commissioned in 1935 the sterling silver trophy stands more than 5ft 4in tall and weighs approximately 110 pounds honoring every winner since 1911 with their sculpted faces affixed to the iconic trophy.

The life-size clay image is used as a reference when Behrends works on the smaller model which is created out of a mixture of oil-based clays. The clay model is eventually turned into a mold and then cast in wax which is sent out to a jeweler to be transformed into sterling silver. Behrends ends his process by polishing and buffing the image before attaching it to the Borg-Warner Trophy.

“The Borg-Warner Trophy is a revered tradition of the motorsport community and BorgWarner is pleased to carry on its incredible legacy” said Frédéric Lissalde president and CEO BorgWarner Inc. “It is our honor to be a part of the unveiling of this year’s trophy even more so following a tumultuous year that has taught us much about perseverance.

“Takuma’s hard work and dedication to his sport is outstanding and on behalf of all of BorgWarner we extend our congratulations to him for his second badge of honor on this trophy that represents the pinnacle of performance for open-wheel racing.”

Later this year Sato will receive a BorgWarner Championship Driver's Trophy also known as a “Baby Borg” which is a miniature replica of the Borg-Warner Trophy that will feature a duplicate of his sterling silver image. Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing will also receive a memento commemorating the victory: the BorgWarner Championship Team Owner’s Trophy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Their plans later morphed into a remote heart monitor manufacturer purchased by Boston Scientific for $925 million in cash in January.

The story of how a group of southeastern Minnesota software developers ended up creating one of the top remote cardiac monitor devices in the world starts with Rochester’s mix of cutting-edge technology and innovative health care.

Preventice Solutions' road twisted and turned along the way to the Boston Scientific sale but it was always the team of Jon Otterstatter Greg Wobig Scott Burrichter and Dan Spors behind the wheel. Spors left company in 2015.

'It clicked'

Three of Preventice's founders went to college in Winona and one had roots in Wisconsin. Their paths had crossed many times over the years as they worked in Rochester for IBM or IBM vendors. Eventually they all ended up at ShowCase Corp.

“That’s where the whole thing started right there” remembered Wobig. “It clicked … the way we worked together … the way we tackled things.”

Winona State grads Wobig Burrichter and Spors were not as comfortable in a big corporate setting.

“It was overwhelming. Small seemed good” said Wobig.

When SPSS Inc. acquired ShowCase in 2001 the trio left and formed a small consulting firm called Boost Information Systems. Otterstatter stayed on until 2007. Once he “retired” from SPSS/ShowCase the guys at Boost met to have a chat.

“They said ‘We don’t think you’re done”” remembered Otterstatter.

Brainstorming 'big'

That kicked off some brainstorming about what kind of company the four of them could run together. They had some money in the bank and could forgo salaries for a while. The goal was to make something that could go ""big"" rather than something small that could provide a decent income.

“We looked at a number of things. We had experience in software analytics. We had experience in mobile. That was the days of Palm Pilots Blackberries ... Nokia” said Burrichter.

Preventice was soon launched and entered the new world of smartphone apps though their experience at IBM and ShowCase resulted in more than the usual iPhone apps of the time. Preventice’s apps could collect and analyze data.

“We had a platform behind the app. We were taking an enterprise approach” said Burrichter. “Pharma companies soon saw the value of that data and analysis.”

Otterstatter describes that time as “a turning point” when they understood the potential of mobility software and health care.

“The health care platform was going to be the thing” he said.

Preventice started working with Merck Pfizer Coppertone and other health-related companies with their mobile applications. They created 50 to 60 apps during the early days of the smartphone app goldrush.

One of their iPhone apps – a UV sunscreen aid made for Coppertone – was demonstrated on ABC’s “Good Morning America” in July 2010.

The Rochester company had 30 to 40 employees in 2010 but not all of them were working on apps. A 2009 meeting with Mayo Clinic Ventures had resulted in a new project.

A Mayo venture

Mayo Clinic Ventures Chair Steve VanNurden had told the Preventice team about a new remote monitor device that had potential.

“I believed that someday you would be able to monitor patients remotely but did not know when the technology would be ready for the marketplace"" recalled VanNurden who now works in Colorado. ""Dr. Paul Friedman and Dr. Charles Bruce were visionaries and we often discussed how we could advance this idea to benefit patients.

“How could patients who at the time had to be admitted into the hospital be sent home with a monitoring device? The physicians had the medical expertise but not necessarily the data analytics expertise needed.”

It was still in the very early stages of development but the Mayo team was thinking about a mobile “front-end” system to communicate with phones and collect data.

“When we were introduced to it it was basically a circuit board with wires hanging off of it” remembered Burrichter. “At that point we weren’t medical device people. We were software people with a background in analytics.”

However VanNurden soon offered Preventice an exclusive license to commercialize the technology.

“So we became hardware guys” said Wobig.

Flipping to hardware

Taking on the remote monitor project meant learning about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It meant finishing the work on the monitor and designing a patch to allow patients to wear it. It meant coming up with a name for the monitor “Body Guardian.” The “big pivot” meant raising money less than a half million dollars at first from the Merck Global Health Innovation Fund to finance the project.

“We were flipping from a service company to a product company” said Burrichter.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the two years it took to develop the BodyGuardian patch device and related system about 90 percent of the Preventice team continued to create commercial mobile projects to keep the lights on as 10 percent worked on the monitor.

That flipped to 90 percent working on the monitor after the FDA approved the BodyGuardian monitor to track nonlethal arrhythmia in 2012 just five years after Preventice formed as a software company.

The company had 50 to 60 employees at that point. Otterstatter opened a corporate office in Minneapolis but the bulk of the company and all of the development team continued to work in Rochester.

Pepin Manufacturing Inc. in Lake City did the initial work on the monitor’s patch which is designed for a patient to wear 30 days comfortably. In the early days many physicians bluntly told the Preventice team that a patch would never work.

“We were just crazy enough to believe in ourselves anyway” said Otterstatter. Patches are now the industry standard for remote health monitoring devices.

From 2013 to 2015 Preventice sold about 50000 units of the first generation Body Guardian with Mayo Clinic as its first customer.

Mayo Clinic turned out to be unique in its desire to do its own monitoring. Preventice soon realized that most health care centers worked with independent test facilities to monitor patients. That meant Preventice needed help with the service aspect.

Preventice found that Houston Texas-based eCardio Diagnostics could help with that part of the operation. With help from Merck Preventice merged with the much-larger eCardio in 2014. The headquarters moved to Texas though Rochester still was home to the development facility.

ADVERTISEMENT

That merger occupied much of the attention and energy at Preventice for two years though another big change happened in 2015. Boston Scientific Corp. purchased a controlling interest in Preventice which gave the company a major boost.

The company grew quickly to include a variety of products including those using artificial intelligence-supported systems. Preventice reported $158 million in net sales in 2020.

$925 million cash

In January Boston Scientific upped its bet on Preventice by purchasing it with “an upfront cash payment of $925 million and up to an additional $300 million in a potential commercial milestone payment.” Since Boston Scientific already holds an equity stake of about 22 percent as an investor the net payment will be about $720 million with “a milestone payment” of up to $230 million.

“It makes sense. We diagnose what they treat. We’re the first step in the chain. They have the devices to treat what our products diagnose” said Burrichter.

What does that mean for the 100 employees who work in Building 003 on the Rochester Technology Campus ?

Otterstatter points out that Boston Scientific has already shown an interest in Rochester by opening a joint venture with Mayo Clinic in One Discovery Square in downtown. He doesn’t see any big change coming for Preventice’s Rochester presence other than maybe some growth.

The acquisition doesn’t mean the founders are retiring to warm climes. All three remaining founders are still at work and have no plans leave the company.

“As a developer I’m excited about the opportunity to go to another scale” said Wobig.

Otterstatter smiled as he thought about the future andwhere Preventice started in 2007.

“We’ve closed the chapter but not the book. There’s another chapter coming” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But now the pharmaceutical sector is on the cusp of a transformation as it delves into cutting-edge technology to come up with new treatments for diseases such as cancer rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to improve the industry’s success rates and speed up drug discovery potentially saving it billions of dollars a recent survey by the analytics firm GlobalData has found. AI topped a list of technologies seen as having the greatest impact on the sector this year. Almost 100 partnerships have been struck between AI specialists and large pharma companies for drug discovery since 2015.

AI uses automated algorithms – sets of instructions that computers follow – to perform tasks previously done by humans. It can sift quickly through large datasets (from clinical studies and scientific literature) to detect hidden patterns and perform tasks within seconds that would usually take months. A study in the Lancet found AI software could identify breast cancers that were missed by doctors in mammograms.

In a process known as machine learning AI systems run through millions of possibilities improving each time until they are able to perform acceptably. The output of that training is an algorithm.

“Drug discovery is being transformed through the use of AI which is reducing the time it takes to mine the vast amounts of scientific data to enable a better understanding of disease mechanisms and identify new potential drug candidates” says Karen Taylor director of the Centre for Health Solutions at accounting and consultancy group Deloitte. “Traditional drug discovery has been very fragmentary very hit and miss” she adds.

Taylor says the rapid progress of Covid-19 vaccines and potential treatments has been aided by the use of AI techniques. “It allows you to cross-reference a lot of published literature with other data within seconds.”

Kitty Whitney director of thematic research at GlobalData says the Covid-19 crisis could be a “tipping point” for widespread adoption across the pharma industry.

About 90% of large pharmaceutical firms initiated AI projects last year according to the US research firm Trinity Life Sciences. AstraZeneca and GSK Britain’s two biggest drugmakers committed in November to a five-year partnership with Cambridge University to fund the Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine. The 15-strong team will develop AI and machine-learning technologies to improve clinical trials personalised medicine and drug discovery.

GSK had previously opened a £10m AI research base in King’s Cross central London near Google’s DeepMind AI lab. Its global team of AI experts has grown to 50 people which it wants to double to 100.

Functional genomics – a new area of science that looks at why small changes in a person’s genetic make-up can increase the risk of diseases – deals with huge datasets. Each person has about 30000 genes which can be combined with others as Hal Barron GSK’s chief scientific officer explains. “You start to realise you’re dealing with trillions and trillions of data points even per experiment and no human can interpret that it’s just too complicated.”

Large pharmaceutical companies have been criticised for being slow to embrace technological advances. Drug discovery has a woefully low success rate – of 10 drugs in development nine will typically fail; it takes 10-12 years on average and comes with a high cost of more than $2bn to take a medicine through research and development and regulatory approval.

Conventional drug discovery has been compared to a “molecular casino” by Alex Zhavoronkov an expert in the use of AI for developing new drugs who runs Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine.

GSK’s Barron reckons the use of AI technologies could at least double the success rate to 20% which would save billions of dollars spent on drug development. Others like Zhavoronkov hope the success rate could improve much more potentially to 50%.

All of the world’s top 10 drugmakers – the Swiss firms Novartis and Roche; the US companies Pfizer Johnson & Johnson Merck AbbVie and Bristol Myers Squibb; France’s Sanofi; and the UK’s AstraZeneca and GSK – are now investing in AI mainly through collaborations or by acquiring technologies.

Kim Branson GSK’s global head of AI and machine learning says AI is being used in the search for treatments for infectious diseases as well as for diseases that are harder to crack such as cancer rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disorders such as Crohn’s. Alzheimer’s– “the hardest of the hard targets” – is on GSK’s radar but will be tackled at a later stage.

Zhavoronkov says the problem with Alzheimer’s and the brain disorder Parkinson’s disease is that there is not enough data available to study them hence the large number of drug failures to date.

Zhavoronkov and Barron have expressed confidence that a major breakthrough in one of the harder-to-research diseases can be achieved with AI technologies. Barron compares the potential to having a new microscope. “Within the next year or two we might find a target that really can make a difference.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWp1c3Qtc29sZC1oaXMtcGZpemVyLXN0b2NrLXNob3VsZC15L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Just Sold His Pfizer Stock. Should You?,"You should definitely follow Buffett in one way.

Warren Buffett once said ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" Most of the stocks that Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.41%) (BRK.B 0.30%) buys it holds for years -- but not all of them.

Berkshire opened a position in Pfizer (PFE -1.39%) in the third quarter of 2020. In a regulatory filing last week though Berkshire revealed that it had dumped all of its shares in the big drugmaker. Pfizer became one of 37 stocks Buffett sold last year and one of 15 of which he completely exited. Now that Buffett has sold all of his Pfizer stock should investors who aren't billionaires follow suit?

Why Warren why?

Many investors are wondering why Buffett closed out Berkshire's position in Pfizer so quickly. It's first important to note that Buffett might not have made the decision himself. He has increasingly delegated authority to Berkshire's investing managers Todd Combs and Tedd Weschler in recent years. However Buffett presumably went along with the decision to sell Pfizer even he didn't personally call the shot.

Unfortunately Berkshire doesn't include footnotes in its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that explain the reasoning behind each of its stock trades. Buffett (or perhaps Combs or Weschler) will sometimes make a public remark giving the context behind Berkshire's purchase or sale of a given stock. However that's the exception not the rule.

I think it's unlikely that any of these men will comment on the Pfizer sale. The big pharmaceutical company wasn't a major holding for Berkshire. Sure Berkshire reported a value of $136.2 million for its more than 3.7 million shares in its Q3 13F-HR filing to the SEC but that's only a drop in the bucket for the huge conglomerate.

Cross these off the list

We can't know for sure why Buffett or his lieutenants opted to exit the position in Pfizer. However we can cross some possible reasons off the list.

Buffett clearly hasn't soured on all big pharma stocks. Berkshire bought more shares of AbbVie Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck (NYSE: MRK) during the fourth quarter.

It also wasn't a situation where Berkshire decided to cut its losses. Pfizer's average share price during the fourth quarter was higher than in the third quarter.

Did Pfizer's business prospects change for the worse? Not really. Sure the company reported disappointing results from a late-stage study of Ibrance in November. However those results basically just confirmed what investors already expected after another clinical setback for the breast cancer drug earlier in 2020.

In several ways Pfizer's prospects improved during Q4. The company completed its merger of Upjohn with Mylan moving a block of legacy drugs with declining sales off its books. Pfizer won emergency use authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty (BNT162b2) in the U.S. and in Europe. It lined up major supply deals for Comirnaty totaling in the hundreds of millions of doses. The company also reported good news for several of its pipeline programs.

All we can do is guess why Berkshire sold all of its Pfizer shares. I think the most plausible explanation is simply that Buffett and his team thought they could get a higher return by investing in other stocks.

Follow Buffett's advice

Returning to our original question should investors sell Pfizer because Buffett did? The answer to that question is a resounding ""no."" Your investment goals could be (and probably are) very different from a $569 billion holding company.

Many investors bought Pfizer stock for its dividend. That dividend still looks attractive. Others bought shares because they thought Pfizer's growth prospects would increase after the Upjohn-Mylan transaction closed. That's still a good assumption. Still others probably invested in the drugmaker because of its potential to make a lot of money off of its COVID-19 vaccine. The sales potential for the vaccine is greater now than it's been in the past thanks to new orders flowing in.

Are there other stocks that might pay a higher dividend yield or deliver greater growth? Absolutely. But that was the case throughout the last year -- including when Berkshire bought its initial stake in Pfizer.

I think that you should follow Buffett's advice but not necessarily his example. If you were willing to own Pfizer for 10 minutes be willing to own it for 10 years.",,,,,,,,,

The Gaza campus protests on Brown University will come to an end at least through the end of the school year but not because police stormed student encampments and hauled out demonstrators in zip ties.

Brown has instead successfully negotiated an end to the protests by agreeing to hold a vote on a key issue driving the protests: divestment.

The university's corporate board agreed on Tuesday that it will hold a vote on whether or not it will divest its interest from Israel a major victory for students protesting the ongoing war in Gaza.

In return protesters will tear down their encampment and have agreed not to restart protests during the school year.

“The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this” Christina Paxson the university's president wrote in a statement. “Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog debate and listening to each other.”

While the broader point of the protests has been to call attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians since the 7 October Hamas terror attack the more direct — and actionable — issue at the heart of the campus demonstrations has been a demand for colleges to stop spending money in ways that benefit Israel.

Divestment

“Disclose divest we will not stop we will not rest” has been an oft repeated chant on the campus of Columbia University where the latest round of student protests began in mid April.

Disclosure is obvious — the protesters want to know how the universities are spending their money specifically with regard to money that benefits Israel.

Divestment is essentially the opposite of an investment. The students want their schools to stop pouring money into Israel which they argue makes them complicit in the ongoing violence in Gaza.

Palestinian advocacy groups have called for divestment since at least 2005. Since then BDS — boycott divest sanction — has been a common demand from advocates for Palestine.

Universities maintain endowments which are funds they use to invest in stocks bonds and companies to help generate revenue.

Different student groups have different demands when it comes to divestment. At Brown students agreed to end their protest so long as the university at least holds a vote on the matter. At Yale and Cornell students have asked that their schools specifically divest any money that aids in weapon manufacturing.

At Columbia students have made a more substantial ask; they want the school to stop using its $13.6bn endowment to invest in any company that does business with Israel. That includes major international powerhouses like Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon according to CNN.

What does divestment look like?

Columbia has actually divested in the interest of civil rights in the past; in the 1980s students protesting apartheid South Africa successfully convinced the school to sell the majority of its stocks in companies connected to South Africa. That divestment included selling stock in Ford and Coca-Cola.

Nicholas Dirks a former chancellor of the University of California spoke with CNN and argued that university investments were more complicated today than in the 1980s making divestment a tricky road to travel.

“The economy is so global now that even if a university decided that they were going to instruct their dominant management groups to divest from Israel it would be almost impossible to disentangle” he told CNN. “It’s not clear to me that it’s really possible to fully divest from companies that touch in some way a country with such close political and trade ties to the US.""

Professor Todd Ely from the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver said that divestments don't typically work to shift a company's behaviour but it can work to draw significant attention to a cause.

""Divestment itself doesn't really influence the companies or the industries being targeted directly"" he told NPR. ""It's more the stigma created and drawing attention to the issue more broadly.""

Columbia University has divested in the past so why not now?

He agreed with the statement that modern university endowments are complex and make divestment a complicated — though not impossible — endeavour. He pointed out that investments made through endowments are intended to go back to supporting students and providing financial aid.

""So it's a complex situation where calls to change the way these funds are invested by students and other interested parties do end up kind of in a circular way going back to support the students themselves"" he said.

Chris Marsicano an assistant professor of education studies at Davidson College told PBS that the divestment movement against apartheid South Africa did not greatly affect its economy but the ""slow drip"" of headlines about colleges dropping their support did put political pressure on the nation.

""So we're pretty sure that — from research that divestment in South Africa didn't make a big economic impact which shouldn't be a surprise as universities weren't heavily invested in South Africa during the apartheid era"" he said. ""But the political pressure the slow drip of headline after headline after headline announcing different colleges and universities divesting certainly put political pressure on the apartheid regime.""

He said it appears that the Columbia protests have been successful in putting political pressure on Israel pointing to the fact that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt the need to denounce the demonstrations.

""When we hear last week that Prime Minister Netanyahu specifically mentions campus protests in the United States that lets us know that college students have captured the attention of key stakeholders for peace"" he said.

What are universities saying about divestment?

On 29 April Columbia University president Nemat Minouche Shafik said the school would not divest from Israel and they are not the only school to balk at the students' demands.

The University of California also said it would not divest claiming doing so ""impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses"" according to a statement.

American University in Washington DC also rejected divestment calls.

“Such actions threaten academic freedom the respectful free expression of ideas and views and the values of inclusion and belonging that are central to our community” Sylvia Burwell the president of American University said in a statement according to the Associated Press.

At Yale University President Peter Salovey said in a message that the school's Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility recommended against divestment including divestment from certain military weapons manufacturers.

The University of Michigan rejected calls for divestment noting that it has no direct investment with Israeli companies and that only a fraction of a per cent of the university’s $18bn endowment was indirectly invested. The college justified its decision by referring to a 20-year-old policy that ""shields the university's investments from political pressures.""

Some colleges have been more amenable to discussing divestment.

Like Brown protests at Northwestern Univeristy ended after the school agreed late on Monday to create an advisory committee on university investments.

Portland State University took a step toward divestment when it announced on 29 April that it would pause its gifts and grants from Boeing in response to protesters demands.

UC Riverside also agreed to “examine” its endowment fund.

“The UC Riverside campus agreed to form a taskforce to examine whether the college’s endowment fund should be removed from the wider UC investment office in order to divest.”

The University of Texas Dallas said it would also welcome “the opportunity for open respectful dialogue” with student protesters on the issue KERA reports.

According to US Department of Education data approximately 100 US colleges have reported either gifts or contracts from Israel that total $375m over the last 20 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9wcm9mb290YmFsbHRhbGsvcnVtb3ItbWlsbC9uZXdzL2JlbmdhbHMtc2VuaW9yLXBlcnNvbm5lbC1leGVjdXRpdmUtdHJleS1icm93bi1kZWNsaW5lcy1wYXRyaW90cy1pbnRlcnZpZXctcmVxdWVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengals senior personnel executive Trey Brown declines Patriots' interview request,"The Patriots have begun the search to hire a new football operations chief.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

Brown' Haul in 1st Round of NFL Draft,"Cooper Neill/Getty Images

San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk was a popular name floated in trade rumors leading up to the 2024 NFL draft but it sounds like the asking price for him was fairly steep.

ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported on Tuesday that ""much of the league was keeping a close eye on the 49ers' handling of the wide receiver position throughout the draft."" However many teams learned that San Francisco was seeking a similar haul to what the Tennesee Titans received when they traded star receiver A.J. Brown to the Philadelphia Eagles.

""Multiple teams told me they had interest in Brandon Aiyuk but they believed the 49ers wanted a first-round pick for him with one comparing the situation to that of A.J. Brown who went from Tennessee to Philadelphia in 2022 in exchange for the 18th pick"" Fowler explained. ""The Eagles then signed him to a four-year $100 million contract. Trading for Aiyuk would have required a new deal and a premium pick.""

Aiyuk is entering the final year of his contract and is set to make $14.1 million in the 2024 season. He has not been shy about his desire to receive a new contract but it doesn't appear that there has been much progress on that front.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbm5lc3NlZXRpdGFucy5jb20vbmV3cy90aXRhbnMtd2FpdmUtZGVmZW5zaXZlLWxpbmVtYW4tc2hha2VsLWJyb3du0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Titans Waive Defensive Lineman Shakel Brown,

Some betting Las Vegas could take esports to new level post-pandemic

Esports boomed online over the past year. It’s unclear whether that success continues in a post-pandemic world but experts see renewed possibility for Las Vegas to take esports to the next level.

“Vegas could become the esports capital of North America” said Milo Ocampo the founder of Las Vegas-based 8-Bit Esports. The 26-year-old Ocampo AKA “kuyamilo” said he first realized Las Vegas’ potential in 2013. “We have the infrastructure set for it in terms of the convention space the tech is here. And the legacy is essentially here.”

About 55 percent of U.S. residents played video games during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to a recently released report by Nielsen subsidiary SuperData. The same report found that the games and interactive media industry grew 12 percent year-over-year to a $139.9 billion powerhouse in 2020. Streaming reached 1.2 billion people in 2020 and generated $9.3 billion in revenue.

Esports was a booming industry worldwide prior to the pandemic. People spent more than a billion hours watching online streaming platform Twitch in both February and March of 2020 according to data provided by Rainmaker.gg gaming metrics. That number jumped to 1.6 billion in April.

Then the pandemic hit and people were stuck at home those first few months looking for something to do.

No concerts bars shows live sports.

The lack of competitive entertainment provided esports a window to gain new attention especially as traditional sports leagues and athletes began transitioning their own competitions online according to Brett Abarbanel director of research at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute.

“This just upped the ante and moved everything forward probably about five years just in terms of how it might normally have moved up the trajectory” she said.

Esports reached a wider audience as people sought options for entertainment online. That hasn’t changed with the return of live sports but its growth pattern has slowed as the U.S. approaches a year of pandemic life.

“That incredible trajectory was not sustainable. It couldn’t just go through the roof forever. Nothing really can” Abarbanel said. “But we’re still seeing impressive growth and some plateauing.”

Nevertheless that growth has excited Jud Hannigan the CEO of Allied Esports. His company owns the HyperX Esports Arena on the Strip which resumed hosting in-person events June 25 and now holds three or four tournaments per week.

Since the pandemic the arena has expanded into daily and longer online tournaments to reach a wider audience. Viewership is up 1000 percent from pre-pandemic levels for some of the arena’s online content Hannigan said. The company can now pair its online offerings with in-person events something he sees as a potent combination.

“I think in a post-pandemic world we’ll start to see people flying in regularly for our events” he said “and it’s super exciting for us because we weren’t necessarily there pre-pandemic and now we are.”

Hannigan said the arena’s spring closure provided an opportunity to re-evaluate its offerings. Allied Esports views elevating player profiles as central to its business model. Accordingly the company converted a domed space between the lobby and the arena into a “champion’s circle” complete with a 360-degree LED wall highlighting past and current champions wins and stats.

“If they haven’t come during the pandemic once people come back they’re gonna feel that love” Hannigan said. “And I think they’re gonna feel that that experience is only greater.”

‘This is gonna happen’

There’s a sense of unmet potential for esports in Las Vegas.

Hotels. Casinos. Arenas. Shows. Entertainment. Bars. Nightlife. Experts say the infrastructure is all there for an esports tourist destination.

Yet hotel-casinos such as The Linq and Downtown Grand tried cashing in on an expected esports boom a few years ago and have since scaled back. The HyperX arena’s average customer is 16 five years away from enjoying the 21-and-over kind of gaming that drives Nevada’s economy. They may not be old enough to gamble or drink just yet but they will be soon enough said Chris LaPorte founder of Reset Las Vegas a video gaming consulting company.

“(Las Vegas) jumped into this somewhat early on” Abarbanel said in April. “It’s not that esports is not a success story it’s more that esports is not a success story yet. It’s taking more time to develop what’s right for this city.”

Esports are still a new concept she said last month. League of Legends one of the world’s most popular competitive games debuted in 2009. The industry is still trying to figure out what it is. So are the players let alone the businesses hoping to get in the game for the first time she said.

The industry’s nascency does have “upside” for Las Vegas Abarbanel added. There’s room for innovation and definition in a city with plenty of innovators event space and interest in esports. She pointed to the rapid development of the city into a traditional sports hub.

“In a similar manner we might be able to play host to a major esports event or attract a game developer to set up its headquarters in Las Vegas” she said. “We have a lot of opportunity to be a major hub for streamers who want to set up shop we can innovate in that space as well we can have those sorts of talent agencies.”

Esports in Las Vegas “can become something that does grow quite quickly” because groups like the Nevada Esports Alliance never gave up on the possibility said LaPorte also one of the nonprofit’s members. Online tournaments during the pandemic have at times struggled with bad internet connections and cheating scandals he said.

The demand for large live events is real he said and makes venues like the HyperX arena all-the-more attractive.

“We’re still here saying ‘Hey look trust us. This is gonna happen’” LaPorte said. “We have to just figure out what is going to make it work and how to probably align everyone’s needs to ensure that esports is looking at Las Vegas as a place to hold events.”

Las Vegas hasn’t solved that puzzle — yet.

Bet on potential

Nevada’s public and private leaders see renewed opportunity for local esports to reach the next level.

They’ve viewed the industry in recent years as a way to attract a new generation of customers and diversify and fortify Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy.

A Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority spokeswoman said pent-up demand for in-person events will benefit the valley’s venues that host competitions and conferences. The visitors authority is a founding member of the esports alliance.

Video gaming has thrived during the pandemic and esports’ popularity has provided great opportunity for the valley spokeswoman Lori Nelson-Kraft said.

“Esports fans have shown great enthusiasm for events held in Las Vegas with our 24/7 action and robust entertainment offerings” she said. “The esports industry also allows Las Vegas to attract both leisure and business travelers as we can host tournaments as well as (business-to-business) conferences.”

Nevada Sen. Ben Kieckhefer (R-Reno) is drafting legislation that would create what’s thought to be the country’s first government regulating body for esports.

He envisions a “light touch” state oversight group akin to the Nevada Athletic Commission which regulates combat sports like mixed martial arts and boxing through licensure and sanctions.

Kieckhefer said Nevada has the opportunity to support its most important industries gaming and hospitality and establish itself as a global leader in esports.

“I think the general consensus now is that the time has come for something like this” he said.

The long view

Caesars Entertainment Inc. sees signs that esports events will return and is “involved in a number of conversations at present about exciting new events” said Ty Stewart senior vice president of World Series of Poker and esports.

Stewart said the company believes in esports and thinks Las Vegas “can and will be the de facto home” for esports competitions and festivals.

Esports wagering offers substantial opportunity Stewart said. Caesars is excited about new ways to apply gaming to esports “beyond the traditional outcome markets particularly peer-to-peer gaming on popular titles and streamer betting with instantly served proposition bets.”

“It’s a long regulatory road and most states are focused on sports betting when it comes to iGaming presently but the potential is significant” he said.

Nevada currently considers esports wagers as event betting like wagering on the Olympics rather than sports betting for the NFL said UNLV’s Abarbanel also a director with the esports alliance. Esports betting today requires an application and review process for each event before someone can place a bet she said. The Nevada Gaming Control Board has approved betting on several esports competitions over the past year.

The valley’s inherent advantages as a tourist destination and an “expedited — or overhauled — approval process” could create a unique esports experience according to Chris Grove an analyst with California-based gaming research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

“Everything I see leads me to believe that gambling will play a major role in the growth and development of esports” he said.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Red Rock Resorts and MGM Resorts International declined to comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Boyd Gaming Corp. didn’t return requests for comment.

‘That’s the strength of Vegas’

It will take buy-in for Las Vegas to reach its potential as an esports destination experts say.

Grove said the U.S. is large enough to have several esports hubs each attracting slightly different audiences. Las Vegas’ key will be consistency.

“As Vegas hosts more successful events the city is likely to continue to earn a reputation in the esports community” he said. “Vegas is an amazing backdrop for all sorts of events and that’s the strength of Vegas.”

One hurdle he notes is casinos aren’t necessarily designed for a younger gaming crowd. Esports events must be planned “holistically.”

A generational gap exists between the hospitality industry’s decisionmakers and esports experts said Jairo Urcuyo founder and CEO of esports organization Las Vegas Inferno. A hotel-casino simply throwing a tournament each week isn’t going to cut it; proper marketing and concerted effort to reach a new audience are necessary.

“You’re not marketing towards your regular people who come to the casino and play slots or play poker” Urcuyo said. “You’re not catering to that generation. They’ve got to understand that they’re catering to the new generation that’s up and coming. And a lot of casinos don’t understand that.”

Urcuyo and others highlight an “authenticity” problem that is hard to define but gamers know it when they see it. They bristle at perceived pandering and are skeptical of those who want their business but don’t share their passion he said.

LaPorte with the esports alliance said esports athletes are celebrities with legions of fans comparable to LeBron James in the NBA. Las Vegas already caters to a celebrity culture he said and city promoters must lean into “nerd culture” and attract popular gamers to town; their fans will follow.

“The subscribers to a popular celebrity on Twitch are rabid fans” said Robert Rippee director of the Hospitality Lab at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute. “They consume every word the actions they’re highly engaged.”

“And that is a lesson for everybody on loyalty. If we can achieve that kind of loyalty oh my gosh it’s game over for anything else.”

Gina Carano recently fired from Disney+’s Star Wars offshoot The Mandalorian over controversial social media posts is from a prominent Nevada casino family.

Carano 38 is the daughter of Glenn Carano a former Dallas Cowboys quarterback now working as Eldorado Resorts senior vice president for the East region. This region includes Ohio Pennsylvania and West Virginia according to his LinkedIn profile. He also served for more than five years as general manager of Eldorado Resort Casino in Reno.

Gina Carano’s grandfather is Don Carano a former Army officer and Nevada lawyer who opened the 282-room Eldorado in 1973 on North Virginia Street in Reno.

In the early 1990s Don Carano partnered with other hotel-casino companies to build the Silver Legacy Resort Casino in Reno. The Reno Gazette-Journal calls this property the city’s “first mega-themed resort.”

Vegas Dynasty

In addition to forming the law firm McDonald Carano Wilson he also founded Ferrari-Carano Vineyards and Winery. The winery is in the Dry Creek Valley of Sonoma County Calif.

Carano died in 2017 two weeks before his 86th birthday.

Former Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told the newspaper that the Northern Nevada city “would look a lot different without Don.” Cashell also served as Nevada’s lieutenant governor.

It was his leadership that helped create and redevelop downtown” Cashell said.

In 2020 Eldorado Resorts acquired Caesars Entertainment retaining the Caesars name for the company.

It is the largest casino and entertainment company in the US. Its properties include resorts in Reno and Las Vegas a land-based casino in New Orleans and other hotel-casinos in the US and overseas.

‘Abhorrent and Unacceptable’

Gina Carano recently was released from the Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian after an Instagram post comparing the treatment of current political differences to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. She also has been criticized for other social media posts including one apparently mocking pronoun preferences. Her Twitter bio in the fall identified her preference as “beep/bop/boop.” It later was removed.

Her posts recently prompted a #FireGinaCarano Twitter hashtag. Some users tagged Lucasfilm and its parent company Disney. The Mandalorian airs on the Disney+ streaming service. She played a character named Cara Dune.

Earlier this month a spokesperson for Lucasfilm said Carano “is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future.”

“Nevertheless her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable” according to the spokesperson.

New Movie Partnership

Carano a former mixed martial arts fighter has announced a film partnership with The Daily Wire. She is slated to develop and star in a movie available for paid subscribers on the company website. According to The Hollywood Reporter the film’s specifics “are still under wraps — the title budget director etc.”

Carano said the new project “is helping make one of my dreams — to develop and produce my own film — come true.”

I have only just begun using my voice which is now freer than ever before and I hope it inspires others to do the same” she said. “They can’t cancel us if we don’t let them.”

Dana White president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship urged people to “leave Gina alone” according to the MMA Fighting website.

“Listen we make mistakes” he said.

Here is a clip of some Carano scenes from the series:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vOTczZXNwbi5jb20vZXh0cmEtcG9pbnRzLXRydW1wLXBsYXphLWltcGxvc2lvbi1tYXJrZWQtZW5kLW9mLWFuLWVyYS1pbi1hLWMtYm94aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Extra Points: Trump Plaza Implosion Marked End of An Era in A.C. Boxing,"Trump Plaza hit the canvas in a matter of seconds last Wednesday morning dropping faster than Michael Spinks did against Mike Tyson at nearby Boardwalk Hall 31 years ago.

It had been on the ropes for a while however. The implosion merely completed a 10-count that had been going on for more than 25 years. Donald Trump's first Atlantic City casino had become an empty rusting shell long past the days when celebrities dined at its restaurants bet $100000 a hand at the blackjack tables and sat ringside to see Tyson Evander Holyfield and others fight at both Trump Plaza's Imperial Ballroom and Boardwalk Hall.

After it opened in 1984 there was about a 10-year span where Trump Plaza was a sports and entertainment mecca.

It quickly joined Atlantis Bally's Claridge Harrah's Playboy Resorts Sands and Tropicana in holding boxing at its property enabling Atlantic City to surpass Las Vegas as the ""Boxing Capital of the World.""

There were 123 cards held in town in 1984 followed by a whopping 144 in 1985. It was not unusual for Atlantic City to host three or four boxing events in a week.

""Those were definitely the good old days for boxing in A.C."" said New York's Ron Katz who promoted shows in Atlantic City for Top Rank and HBA-East.

According to BoxRec.com the first boxing card held at Trump Plaza was on Dec. 7 1984 when New England-based promoter Robert Andreoli staged a small show headlined by a NABF lightweight bout between Guy Villegas and Dennis Cruz.

Top Rank Promotions got started at Trump with a card on June 11 1985 with unbeaten featherweight Bernard Taylor vs. Tyrone Downes. One month later a promising young heavyweight named Mike Tyson scored a second-round TKO over John Alderson in an undercard bout.

""Everyone likes to remember the big fights in Atlantic City with Tyson Holyfield (George Foreman) and others but the years leading up to those fights helped build boxing in town"" said Brigantine's Bernie Dillon who ran Trump Plaza's boxing program from 1984 to 1991. ""We did a lot of boxing back then but so did Resorts Sands Caesars the Trop and others. Those shows were what paved the way for us to do those big Tyson fights.""

Because virtually every card was nationally televised whether it was on ABC CBS NBC ESPN USA or HBO it afforded local casinos the opportunity to grow their brand via publicity.

Dillon and a young marketing executive named Dave Coskey got creative. According to Coskey who now lives in Avalon Trump Plaza was the first to put their name on the ring corner pads and on the rope ties.

""The world was focused on Atlantic City because of some of the events that were held there"" Coskey said. ""There was a time when Trump Plaza was a monster in the casino industry. We only had 800 rooms but at one point it was the most profitable casino in the world.""

Tyson fought six times in Atlantic City in 1985-86 including four times at Trump Plaza.

His earlier appearances specifically a bout against Jose Ribalta on Aug. 17 1986 helped Dillon and Trump Plaza's boxing program gain the inside track for Tyson's megafights at Boardwalk Hall against Spinks Tyrell Biggs Larry Holmes the late Carl Wiliams and the late Alex Stewart from 1987-90.

""(Tyson's former co-managers) Bill Cayton and Jim Jacobs needed a place to hold Tyson-Ribalta"" Dillon said. ""(Former Trump executives) Mark Etess and Stephen Hyde (who were both killed in a 1989 helicopter crash) worked out a deal that contained a right of first refusal for some of Tyson's future fights. There were some that were better-suited to Las Vegas but Atlantic City hosted most of the big ones.""

Although Tyson's big fights were held at Boardwalk Hall Trump Plaza served as the host hotel. As such the bars restaurants and gaming tables were always packed with celebrities and high rollers.

That was especially true of Tyson-Spinks which was held on June 27 1988 a Monday. The fight reportedly produced $344 million in gamble revenue in Atlantic City that weekend. Trump Plaza registered a record casino drop of $11.5 million on the day of the fight.

""It was an amazing event probably the most amazing event Atlantic City has ever seen"" Trump told me in a 2013 interview. ""The buzz around that fight was incredible.""

The entire town was filled for Tyson-Spinks. Every hotel within a 35-mile radius was sold out. Traffic was backed up for 20 miles on the Garden State Parkway. Although a record crowd of 21785 watched Tyson's 91-second knockout hundreds more arrived too late.

""I can remember walking into the Tyson-Spinks fight and people were flowing out of (Boardwalk) Hall"" said Ken Condon former Bally's Atlantic City president who was working at Resorts in 1988. ""I got a late start after loading some customers onto trams at Resorts and I missed the first-round KO.

""I wasn't late again for any Tyson fights after that though. When Tyson was in town it was electric. All of the casinos purchased tickets for their customers! Tyson fights were great citywide events that drove business not only through the casinos but to all of local restaurants and bars.""

The last fight to come close to generating that much money and interest in Atlantic City was Holyfield-George Foreman. Approximately 20000 fans filled Boardwalk Hall on April 19 1991 to watch Holyfield carve out a 12-round unanimous decision.

Financial troubles forced Trump out of the boxing business just three years later.

According to boxrec.com the final fight card at Trump Plaza happened on Aug. 19 1994 with middleweight Tony Marshall earning a 10-round split decision over Lonnie Beasley in the main event.

Condon and Caesars Entertainment took over where Trump left off and helped keep big-time boxing alive in town. A $90 million renovation that was completed in 2002 reduced Boardwalk Hall's seating capacity for boxing to about 14000 but major fights featuring the late Arturo Gatti Sergio Martinez Kelly Pavlik Bernard Hopkins Holyfield and others kept Atlantic City in the mix for a little while.

It's sad to see what's happened in recent years.

Seven years have passed since the last fight at Boardwalk Hall's main arena took place. That ring has essentially remained in storage since Sergey Kovalev beat Bernard Hopkins on Nov. 8 2014.

Trump Plaza vacant since 2014 is now gone just like the Atlantis the Sands Playboy and others who helped make Atlantic City a hotbed for boxing in the 1980s.

Boxing appeared on the verge of a comeback in early 2020 when Ocean Casino Hotel and Hard Rock Hotel & Casino - former the Trump Taj Mahal - held cards on Showtime and ESPN respectively in January. Two months later the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

Other states have started to host boxing shows again in recent months but New Jersey has yet to book another show. March 7 will mark one year since the last card was held at Bally's Atlantic City.

Like Trump Plaza boxing appears to have imploded.

""I think boxing can still make a comeback here but it won't be like it once was"" Dillon said. ""That was quite a heyday.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvYWZ0ZXItbW9udGhzLW9mLWNvdmlkLW1pc2VyeS1jYXNpbm8tY29tcGFuaWVzLXJlYWR5LWZvci1hLXJlYm91bmQtMjI4NTM2MS_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtY29sdW1ucy9pbnNpZGUtZ2FtaW5nL2FmdGVyLW1vbnRocy1vZi1jb3ZpZC1taXNlcnktY2FzaW5vLWNvbXBhbmllcy1yZWFkeS1mb3ItYS1yZWJvdW5kLTIyODUzNjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After months of COVID misery casino companies ready for a rebound,"The coronavirus pandemic has squeezed Nevada’s casinos but it looks like the outlook is finally changing and companies are preparing for the comeback they’ve expected.

As Nevada approaches the anniversary of the start of the 78-day coronavirus-induced casino shutdown several sources are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.

The only problem is that it’s a really long tunnel.

Last week the American Gaming Association said the U.S. commercial gaming industry saw revenue hit a 17-year low of $30 billion in 2020 off by 31 percent from 2019. Everybody saw that coming and an optimistic point of view would be that now that most properties have reopened and are seeing casino floor capacities raised and customers returning there’s nowhere to go but up.

Look no further than MGM Resorts International for a taste of that optimism as the company last week announced that it is ready to go back to 24/7 operations at The Mirage Mandalay Bay and Park MGM beginning March 3.

While some companies have focused on keeping their doors open and paying their slimmed-down staffs during the pandemic a few have begun investing in new technology infrastructure to better serve customers when they do return.

Boyd Gaming Corp. collaborating with Aristocrat Technologies announced last week that it is on the verge of rolling out a “digital wallet” on a mobile app that is linked to Boyd’s B Connected loyalty program.

Similarly Golden Entertainment Inc. the company behind The Strat Arizona Charlie’s and the PT’s Pub franchise will debut Quick Play with Konami Gaming tying in with Golden’s True Rewards program.

During an earnings call last week Boyd lamented how rough 2020 has been for the company. The strength of Boyd’s regional properties portfolio has mitigated some of the damage hitting the company’s Las Vegas locals properties.

Boyd still hasn’t opened Main Street Station in downtown Las Vegas and the Eastside Cannery on Boulder Highway and the company has been hammered downtown in a market segment that it has dominated for years — the Hawaiian Islanders.

The addition of special quarantine protocols for travel between the islands and the mainland have wreaked havoc with that key Boyd market. Boyd has perfected the pipeline between Hawaii and downtown Las Vegas over time so the return to normalcy can’t come too soon for that company.

Boyd and its locals casino rivals Station Casinos have weathered the pandemic relatively well just as gaming industry analysts predicted. Boyd and Station’s parent company Red Rock Resorts were among the rare number of casino companies that registered a fourth-quarter earnings profit.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season a little more than halfway complete the locals and regional companies are surviving better than their Strip counterparts mainly because the amenities the Strip is so famous for — quality entertainment fabulous restaurants big-time professional sports and renowned spas — are shut down or extremely limited by the government’s virus protocols.

In the fourth quarter the largest Las Vegas companies — Las Vegas Sands Corp. MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd. — have collectively lost more than $1 billion. (Caesars Entertainment Inc. is scheduled to report Thursday.)

The airlines that fly tourists to Las Vegas aren’t doing much better with Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. collectively posting close to $1 billion in losses.

Now we’re ready to turn the page. It appears that state health leaders and the government are finally on track to deliver vaccinations and that the public has become more receptive to getting the shots.

There’s light at the end of that long tunnel. and it’s going to take a little more perseverance to reach it.

One of Silicon Valley's oldest and most venerable VC firms was hacked.

Sequoia Capital told its investors on Friday that some personal and financial information may have been accessed by a third party after one of its employees fell victim to a successful phishing attack according to a report in Axios Friday.

Sequoia told investors that it has not yet seen any indication that compromised information is being traded or otherwise exploited on the dark web Axios reported.

""We regret that this incident has occurred and have notified affected individuals"" A Sequoia spokesperson told Insider. ""We have made considerable investments in security and will continue to do so as we work to address constantly evolving cyber threats.""

Sequoia's investors are called limited partners and typically include large financial institutions such as university endowments private family wealth offices or sovereign wealth funds but rarely do firms share information about their investors publicly.

Sequoia Capital is one of Silicon Valley's oldest and most successful venture capital firms with more than $38 billion in assets under management according to Pitchbook data. The 49-year-old venture capital firm has invested in companies such as Airbnb DoorDash and 23andMe. It has also invested in cybersecurity companies like FireEye and Carbon Black according to its website.

And if you're hoping to visit some of Europe's famed Christmas markets this holiday season listen up. We're seeing a plethora of award availability on Swiss International Airlines from multiple U.S. gateways — with four or more seats in many cases. This is a terrific way of putting those hard-earned transferable points to work.

While there are many dates through the summer and fall we'll focus on award availability in November and December — providing a higher likelihood of being able to actually take the trip (as well as a chance to hopefully enjoy the 2021 Christmas markets). From my experience these are actually terrific times to visit Europe thanks to cooler weather and fewer crowds.

And in addition to boasting its own Christmas markets Zurich can also be a great jumping off point for others — like Colmar France one of my favorite yuletide destinations in Europe.

Amazingly enough a significant portion of this award inventory involves flights departing from (or arriving back into) West Coast airports — giving you an incredible way to cross the Atlantic in comfort.

REVIEWS: Swiss business class and economy class

Should you book travel right now?

Before diving into the details of what's available it's critical to consider the implications of booking travel right now. The coronavirus pandemic continues to impact travel around the world and while there are signs of progress there's no telling when countries will reopen for foreign tourists — and what entry requirements they'll provide.

We are seeing some countries airlines and other travel providers moving toward a proof-of-vaccination approach for travelers but there's still a ton of uncertainty.

As a result there's no guarantee that you'd be able to take a November or December vacation to Europe. If you ultimately can't take the trip — and the airline doesn't cancel the flights on its own — you may be on the hook for change or cancellation fees depending on the program you use to book these flights. This could be a good time to purchase independent travel insurance as most of the coverage offered on popular travel rewards credit cards won't cover many COVID-19-related cancellations.

In addition bear in mind that when you transfer your credit card points to a partner airline to book an award ticket there's no way to reverse it. If your flight is canceled you'll wind up with airline miles — not the more valuable transferable currency.

That's not to say you shouldn't consider booking these flights. Just be sure to carefully consider your options and be prepared for any of the above situations to impact your ability to actually take the trip.

With that out of the way read on for a city-by-city rundown of the dates we've found with at least four business-class awards (availability accurate as of the time of writing). Again there are earlier dates available but we're looking solely at November and December departures since most of the major Christmas markets in Central Europe open in late November.

How to book

Since Swiss is a member of Star Alliance you have many different loyalty programs that allow you to book these awards. Here's a quick summary of the best ones for booking Swiss award tickets including transferable point options:

Program One-way award rate to or from Europe Transfer options United MileagePlus 77000 miles Chase Marriott Avianca LifeMiles Up to 63000 miles American Express Capital One Citi Marriott Air Canada Aeroplan Starting at 60000 / 70000 points American Express Capital One Marriott

U.S.-based readers are likely most familiar with United MileagePlus which is a 1:1 transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards. While you won't pay fuel surcharges on award tickets booked through United rates are relatively steep clocking in at 77000 miles each way after last year's partner devaluation. However if you book a round-trip flight you could utilize United's Excursionist perk to effectively add a stopover within Europe.

If you're looking to minimize the number of points you need Air Canada's Aeroplan program may be a better bet. The new program launched in November and these nonstop flights will set you back 60000 points each way from Boston or the New York-area airports. Flights from any of the other gateways require 70000 points each way. Aeroplan doesn't add any fuel surcharges on Swiss-operated flights and you can transfer points from American Express Membership Rewards (1:1) or Capital One (2:1.5) directly to the program.

That said note that Aeroplan's award chart now uses a distance-based formula so adding a connecting flight could increase the number of points you need. For example a one-way flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Stockholm (ARN) via Zurich (ZRH) covers a distance of over 6000 miles — bumping your business-class award rate to 85000 points each way.

Screen shot courtesy of Air Canada

However note that the new Aeroplan program does allow you add a stopover for just 5000 additional points even on one-way award tickets — though you must call to book these itineraries.

For connecting flights Avianca LifeMiles is a solid option requiring just 63000 miles each way. However you could drop that price if you add a connecting flight in economy either within the U.S. or once you arrive in Switzerland. LifeMiles discounts mixed-cabin awards so if you're all right with the short segment in coach you could lower the number of miles you'd need. Avianca is a 1:1 transfer partner of both Amex Membership Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards.

There are other solid Star Alliance loyalty programs — most notable ANA Mileage Club and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer — but both of these impose prohibitive fuel surcharges on Swiss-operated award tickets. As a result you're much better off sticking with one of the three programs detailed above.

These gluts of award space make clear the value of transferable point currencies. If you focus only on earning American miles (for example) you wouldn't be able to jump on a large number of award seats on a Star Alliance carrier like Swiss. And if you elected to earn United miles instead of Amex points you could wind up paying a premium for these seats.

For additional details on using these currencies on Swiss flights check out the following guides:

Bottom line

Swiss is generally known for offering solid award availability in its business-class cabin but being able to snag four (or even more) award seats on many flights from the U.S. is fantastic. I personally have flown Swiss business class three times using Aeroplan miles transferred from American Express and I've found it to be a great way to maximize my Amex points. If you're looking to book a trip to Europe for your family in late 2021 I'd jump on this award availability sooner rather than later."

The family released a statement yesterday advising that Sir Michael has been admitted to Pacific International hospital with serious pancreatic cancer.

According to the statement the cancer is at a critical stage and that family and Sir Micheal's medical team are giving him the utmost care that he deserves.

The family released the statement after numerous inquiries were made regarding the health of Sir Michael.

The family said comprehensive consultations have been done to ensure all clinical opportunities were exhausted to find the best available option to treat this form of cancer.

According to the statement the family in consultation with Sir Michael and Lady Veronica have settled with offering the best palliative care nutritional and dietary care in PNG.

The family has also thanked many Papua New Guineans who have sent in their well wishes and prayers for the health and well-being of Sir Michael and Lady Veronica.

The family has also urged Papua New Guineans to continue to pray for Sir Michael and others that are critically ill and suffering quietly around the country.

Meantime Cardinal Sir John Ribat has also joined the family in calling on prayer groups throughout the nation to pray for the healing and health of the country's founding Prime Minister Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare.

The Cardinal made the call after he visited Sir Michael at his sickbed yesterday where he also held a mass with Sir Michael Lady Veronica and family members.

Did we just have the biggest hint yet of cruises being suspended for even longer and is it just a matter of time until all the major cruise lines issue vaccine requirements? Let’s get into it all in this crucial update on the cruise industry.

It has been a crucial week for the cruise industry as more cruise lines have now started to extend their suspensions into Summer 2021. Vaccine requirement for a safe return of cruising seems to be a growing trend and there are many more updates including return dates for two Carnival-owned cruise brands the name of P&O’s next excel-class mega-ship new options for Carnival cruises that are seven days or less and more. We’ll also get you updated on new extended suspensions announced from four cruise lines.

We start with Carnival-owned Costa Cruises which is now aiming to resume operations on March 27 2021. The cruise line has scheduled an Italian itinerary from the end of March while May will see cruises to international destinations.

The first ship to start sailing will be the company’s flagship vessel Costa Smeralda. Scheduled for March 27 2021 the vessel will be sailing on 7-day itineraries in Italy for one month before her itinerary will change to one-week cruises in the Mediterranean.

A second ship the Costa Luminosa will be joining Costa Smeralda from May 2 2021. The ship is scheduled to sail from Italy on cruises departing and arriving in Trieste.

Costa plans on more ships kickstarting operations with Costa Deliziosa on May 29 out of Venice Costa Magica on the same day from Bari Costa Pacifica out of Barcelona also on May 29 and Costa Firenze out of Genoa on May 30 2021.

You can check all the specific details on itineraries and health measures in our full post over on cruisehive.com.

AIDA Cruises will be opening its Spring 2021 cruise season on March 20. Originally scheduled to start on March 6 the cruise line had been forced to postpone due to various restrictions placed by the German government.

AIDAperla will begin sailing on March 20 out of Gran Canaria.

AIDAstella will also begin sailing on March 20 on an 8-day voyage from Mallorca.

AIDAmar will begin sailing on March 21 on a cruise with multiple stops in the Canary Islands and an overnight in Madeira.

AIDAsol will kickstart her cruises from March 20 on a voyage in Western Europe.

There will be strict health measures in place to make sure all guests and crew remain safe. This will be a clear sign to authorities around the globe that cruises can resume safely.

Crystal Cruises Requires Guests to be Vaccinated

The crucial shift towards needing a vaccine to go cruising is growing as Crystal Cruises has now become the largest cruise operator so far to issue this requirement.

So on February 18 2021 Crystal announced that all guests will need to prove that they have received a COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days before boarding.

The requirement is in addition to the cruise line’s health protocols and the proof will have to be shown before embarkation. There will still be a need for a negative test and health screenings.

The cruise line does expect crew members to be vaccinated but understands the availability in their home countries. For now it’s not a requirement but the crew will still need to have a negative test and meet all the health protocols in place.

Once vaccines are widely available Crystal Cruises will alter its stance and the crew will need to be vaccinated 14 days prior to joining their vessel.

Crystal Cruises has also decided to extend its pause on cruise operations. River cruises are now cancelled through May 2021 and for ocean cruises into June 2021. Operations are also cancelled through August 1 2021 for Yacht sailings and through August for its Expedition ship.

P&O Cruises Reveals Name of Next Mega-Ship

We finally know the name of P&O Cruises’ second excel-class cruise ship. The cruise line revealed that P&O Ionas‘ sister ship will be named Arvia which translates to “From The Seashore.”

Rendering Courtesy: P&O Cruises

The new ship will be a total of 184700 gross tons and she will have an identical design to her sister ship. Arvia will be fully powered by Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) part of a new drive of environmentally friendly vessels from parent company the Carnival Corporation. There will be enhancements to already successful concepts across the fleet along with features already found on P&O Iona.

She will join the fleet in December 2022 and bookings will go on sale in March. The cruise line will be releasing further specific details on Arvia in the coming weeks and months.

Carnival Details Cancellation Options

The Miami-based cruise line has offered new options to guests booked through July 31 2021 on cruises that are seven days or less. A letter was sent which was signed by Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy on January 15 2021 with the new cancellation options.

The cruise line mentions in the letter that the return of cruise operations in the U.S. is still not determined and the cruise line is still waiting on further guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). Guests can now choose what’s best for them moving forward.

So option one will allow guests to maintain their existing booking including any payments that still need to be made. They will receive a $100 onboard credit if the voyage does still go ahead. If the cruise is eventually cancelled and guests have not yet received the enhanced value offer they will receive what’s been offered during the suspension of operations to other guests.

For option two guests can cancel their voyage any time from now to March 31 2021 and receive a full refund. If the cruise was booked with a future cruise credit that could be kept along with onboard credit as long as the next cruise is booked by September 30 2021 for a sailing departing by April 30 2023.

Carnival Cruise Line also released new options for those who are booked on sailings longer than seven days and we have all that covered over on cruisehive.com.

Extended Cruise Line Pauses

We are now starting to see a new round of cancellations and already one major cruise line has cancelled until the summer! Let’s take a look at the latest new suspensions announced from the week.

Norwegian Cruise Line Cancels Until Summer

We start with Norwegian Cruise Line which has now cancelled all sailings through May 2021. Cruise ships won’t resume operations until June at the very earliest and for many ships they will remain on hold for even longer.

This includes all three operators owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. It came as no surprise as days prior to the announcement cruises for May had already been removed from the website.

Viking Cruises Cancels Until Summer

Viking Cruises became the second cruise line in the last several days to extend its pause on operations. River and ocean operations will remain on hold through May 31 2021 which means cruises won’t resume until June at the earliest.

The good news is that Viking vessels remain in a “warm layup” and ready to begin sailings with new health measures in place once government approvals are given. The update was released on February 17 along with a letter sent to any impacted guests and travel agents.

P&O Australia Cancels Into June

P&O Australia announced it will not be sailing any voyages until June 18 2021 bringing cruises in Australia to the start of the Southern winter cruise season.

At the start of the year the company had already decided to postpone all of its voyages to New Zealand and the hope is now that loyal guests will still re-book for a future cruise. Guests can look forward to two new arrivals to the fleet later in the year with Pacific Encounter out of Brisbane and Pacific Adventure out of Sydney.

Crystal Cruises Extends Suspension

As mentioned earlier Crystal Cruises extended its suspension on operations starting from May 2021 for river cruises and for even longer for ocean and yacht sailings.

Disney Cruise Line Removes May Sailings

And breaking news coming in as Disney Cruise Line has just removed all its remaining May 2021 sailings from its website. As of right now nothing has yet been announced.

Even More Cruise News!

So those are just some of the major cruise headlines from the week we’ve got even more over on cruisehive.com including another cruise line requiring crew members to be vaccinated Carnival Cruise Line launches a Monopoly board game NCL provides an update on Alaska sailings Minister in the UK says people shouldn’t be booking travel and a lot more.

The family of Geraldine Turner Carmouche claims that the city the Mystic Krewe of Nyx krewe captain Julie Lea and tractor driver Desmond Williams were negligent in her death the wrongful death lawsuit filed Thursday contends.

Carmouche 58 was killed when she was hit while trying to cross through the middle of a tandem float. The victim’s family says the krewe and float driver failed to warn Carmouche before the incident and failed to enclose the spaces between parts of a tandem float. Carmouche who was related to two Nyx members died at the scene. The rest of the parade was postponed for four days when it ran as part of the Krewe of Pandora procession in Metairie.

The civil suit demands damages from Nyx Lea the city the float’s owner and the man driving the vehicle multiple news agencies reported.

Attempts to contact attorneys for Nyx and the city were not immediately successful.

Carmouche was one of two people killed by tandem floats during Carnival 2020. Three days after she died Joseph Sampson 58 fell under a tandem float in the Krewe of Endymion parade. The fatalities prompted city officials to ban tandem floats for the rest of the 2020 Mardi Gras season.

The track sets the tone opening innocently enough with singer and guitarist Brett Petrusek’s solitary EQ-squeezed guitar riff. And then all hell breaks loose. “It’s about struggling with debauchery” Petrusek says. “You can be a pretty happy-go-lucky dude but sometimes you find yourself in a very dark place like you’re turning into a werewolf. This song is about finding somebody who recognizes your dark side and embraces you for it.” The accompanying music video can be screened viewed below.

Joining Brett Petrusek (Lead Vocals / Guitars) are Robert Berg (Bass / Background Vocals) Eric Vobejda (Background Vocals / Guitars) and Scott Savage (Drums).

Leave it to FuZZrd to find the bright side of Armageddon. The Minneapolis band has a knack for documenting searing personal experiences strapping them to turbo-charged guitar riffs and creating kick-ass rock ‘n’ roll in the process. The result? Tales of obsession devotion and redemption – all sung from the crater of a live volcano. And there’s room for some humor too. Asked about the band name (pronounced “FUZZ-erd”) lead vocalist/guitarist Brett Petrusek laughs and turns evasive: “It has six letters just like the six knobs on an old Marshall amp. It’s actually kinda goofy but we all need some goofy right now.”

The album which will be released following multiple songs being presented for public consumption is in many respects light and dark. There are pulverizing powerful tracks like “Razor” the anthemic “Life Turned Black” and “Viral Connection” which features Mark Slaughter providing guest vocals guitar work and an outro solo. Petrusek offers dryly “a dark twisted little snapshot about retrospectively looking back at your first love.”

The soul-baring approach reaches a peak on “Demons” Petrusek’s gut-wrenching account of learning about the father he had never known. “I recently found my brother who I never knew I had. We talked and in 35 minutes I learned more about my dad than I had ever known before.” You can hear the sheer emotion in Petrusek’s vocal recorded on the first — and only — take. He offers “I’ve become a lot more comfortable letting out my personal thoughts and not second-guessing myself. Being my own therapist and putting it into words. Tapping into the stories that already exist – that’s what makes it more real more genuine.” Bassist Berg sums it up a bit differently sharing “You get these catchy sing-a-long choruses but the lyrics are pretty stark and disturbing” he laughs. “If Black Sabbath and Motörhead took Bon Jovi and Def Leppard rolled them into a joint and smoked it today you’d be in a cloud of FuZZrd“.

FuZZrd’s evolution is a straightforward tale. Petrusek and Berg had played together for years in the well-regarded Minneapolis hard rock outfit Downtread recording three albums and playing a bunch of high profile shows throughout the Midwest. Looking to explore a more organic stripped-down sound they connected with kindred spirits Vobejda (co-founder of the Twin Cities band Via) and Savage (from Minneapolis stalwarts Crashmatic) in late 2019.

The chemistry was instantaneous starting with the interaction of the two guitarists. “I’m not a shredder like Brett” says Vobejda. “I come from the classic punk background. I’m more like drunken Slash meets Kurt Cobain strung out. Somehow it all works out – an ugly thing that turns into a beautiful thing.” The rhythm section quickly dialed-in a lean less-is-more symbiosis between Berg and Savage. “In this band there’s a yin/yang chemistry” explains Berg. “In some other bands there isn’t much yin to the yang. But with this group we have a lot more open space to take liberties.”

FuZZrd benefits from contrasting styles that seem to mesh pretty damn well. “I’m not a metal drummer” Savage admits. “I’m actually a groove drummer and I’ve always been interested in serving the song rather than showing my chops. I’m a huge fan of Prince R&B and Cheap Trick. It was a big change for Brett because he was used to borderline out-of-control metal.”

The four members were ready to unleash the beast in 2020 but then COVID-19 intervened. Amid the crucible of 2020 the band was determined not to let a pandemic go to waste. FuZZrd decided to record their new tracks with producer/engineer Jeremy Tappero who has made countless records in Minneapolis and is best known for his recent work with Soul Asylum (and a longtime ally and collaborator of Petrusek and Berg from their days in Downtread).

They’re stoked about the work-in-progress. “We’re all having so much fun with it” says Savage. “I hate to say we’re taking advantage of the pandemic but the down time has really been important for the band’s chemistry. This is a different way of doing a band. We haven’t even played a show yet! But we’re really loving what we’ve got.”

2021 marks an inflection point for FuZZrd and all the rest of us. A chance to rip off old bandages turn the page and confront what’s really important in life. You might as well find a soundtrack that perfectly captures the moment… and crank it up damn loud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2RheS5jby50dC8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL291dC1vZi10aGUtYXNoZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Out of the ashes,"Out of the ashes

Artist Jackie Hinkson keeps a clean scene at his outdoor Carnival-themed exhibition. -

Carnival 2021 was cancelled but in many ways it was a wonderful Carnival. Necessity is the mother of invention truly and those whose livelihoods rely upon it and those whose sanity depends upon it found creative and innovative ways to make Carnival happen. Congratulations to them for finding the crease Kees Farmer Nappy Yuma and many more all over the country.

The deterioration of the official annual Carnival has been long evident to everyone who is not a masquerader. The idea of “Carnival as spectacle” died some time ago. There is very little to engage the bystander or the dwindling crowd sitting in the stands and even worse those watching at home. As television standards plummeted the costumes shrank and the glitter grew brighter it became a source of depression to witness what had been lost. Apart from pan even endlessly playing a single tune for weeks the only way to enjoy Carnival now is to be in a band which is not possible for many.

So lamentably carnival has become only a thing to do and not a thing to watch. We seemed to forget that Carnival grew out of the people those who commented in costume and those who looked on at the theatre and interpreted the meaning. From ole mas to pretty mas there once was a conversation between practitioner and viewer; now a void exists.

Into that growing chasm widened by its own necessarily revenue-driven orientation stepped Tribe The Lost Tribe and Ultimate Events Ltd last weekend with a spectacular film aired on CNC3 about Carnival which ironically returned Carnival to the non-masquerader or at least shared it. It was the best TT film about Carnival I have seen with production values that should be common to all our TV productions.

The unforgettable live opening event of the 2019 Carifesta at the Savannah conceptualised and directed by the young Daliah Dennison and broadcast live on TV laid down a benchmark for creative ambition and professional standards and showed another wholly inclusive and magical way to tell our story. I was happy to see the equally young Valmiki Maharaj pick up the baton and follow the intrepid Pied Piper’s groundbreaking Spirit of the Wild Oceans.

The irony of the film being called Lavway the call and response between the enslaved and in stickfighting and recreated in the film as a conversation between the various performers and between them and the viewer might have been lost on the film’s creators but it was acute for those who mourn what’s been lost.

It told a story divined by the principal creative talent behind the venture Maharaj and co-written by Muhammad Muwakil about three loosely connected siblings Time Savannah and Carnival. Time is forever Savannah is both steadfast and wild and Carnival is beauty and invention and her development has been quietly witnessed by her siblings. When Savannah hears that Carnival will not be visiting in 2021 he – narrated by Nickolai Salcedo – comes out to speak up about who he is and for Carnival’s importance.

The evocation of the elements of music song dance costuming the shape-shifting nature of Carnival revelry nature’s steadfastness the sense of altered reality union revival rebirth tradition are all captured by the superb choreography soundscape magical lighting direction camerawork and editing.

As ever the film was underfunded but suffered nothing. Carib partnered to provide vital support and its own ads offered an almost seamless stitch in commercial TV breaks. The cast and crew were sizeable so at least some Carnival operatives were busy and earned a little money in this time of drought.

Other sponsors notably NGC did a lot to enable other tabanca sufferers to indulge in some form of Carnival and Massy Foundation was the sole contributing corporate funder of another entirely memorable Carnival happening in 2021 Jackie Hinkson’s two-week 105-foot-long street exhibition of murals in St Ann’s. It attracted up to 2000 people of all ages eager to see the artist’s oblique commentary on the greatest show on earth.

With four Carnival-related large wooden sculptures and four murals: Masquerade Band of the Year 2020 and From Canboulay to Beyoncé the paintings attached to private fences and garden walls challenged a generally narrow concept of what Carnival is about. If the bandleaders think it is just about performance and costume the people know better.

Many returned to the paintings for a conversation with the artist’s meaning for a chance to put on a makeshift fancy sailor costume and do those steps while wondering what the Bookman might be writing or the Midnight Robber foretelling.

The significance of the 2021 Carnival being cancelled and the NCC and the other official bodies doing hardly anything detectable while so many others gave Carnival meaning even in her absence is that it is finally flagrantly obvious that the money and authority are in the wrong hands.

Carnival does not need them. We need a complete rethink. We all know it and the pandemic has shed a light on it. The time to act is now to return Carnival to the people allowing multidimensional expressions of our creativity that allow us to continue the important conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ3VhcmRpYW4uY28udHQvbmV3cy9tb3JlLXZhY2NpbmF0aW9ucy1tZWFuLWNhcm5pdmFsLTIwMjItNi4yLjEyOTE0NDMuZDE2ZDlhYmY5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More vaccinations mean Carnival 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.guardian.co.tt', port=443): Read timed out.

It’s an outwardly simple question that hides a remarkable degree of complexity. Power after all is relative. Militaries decide where to invest their resources based on unique national factors of topography and geostrategy—a development path that makes one military “powerful” would not necessarily be viable for another. With that being said GlobalFirepower’s Military Strength Ranking index employs a unique formula that manages to control for many of the variables that can make these comparisons so fraught. Here are the five militaries that by widespread expert consensus are currently the strongest.

1. The United States

The United States has again taken the crown of the world’s strongest military in 2021 outpacing its nearest competitor by a small but steady margin. With its massive—even if partially bloated—defense budget expansive infrastructure vast manpower and a large pool of potential fit-for-service recruits the United States passes all the underlying criteria of modern military power with flying colors. Its raw potential is matched by a robust defense industry responsible for some of the advanced military hardware in the world. The United States leads the world in airpower quantitatively and qualitatively beating its nearest competitor in most if not all aircraft categories. It maintains by far the most active-service aircraft carriers in the world enjoying a global strike reach through the U.S. Navy’s doctrinal concept of Carrier Strike Groups.

2. Russia

Russia has recovered from its post-Soviet military slump launching a slew of far-reaching modernization projects to revitalize its aging air force and navy. The fruits of those labors can be readily observed in 2021 with a new generation of Russian strategic and cruise missile submarines narrowing the qualitative gap with their U.S. counterparts. Russia’s growing force of modernized corvettes and other small ships reflects Moscow’s commitment to a coastal defense force. Meanwhile Russia continues to hold a large quantitative edge over the United States in all land power categories other than armored vehicles. The airpower matchup is still somewhat lopsided in favor of the United States; as illustrated by its new Su-57 air superiority fighter Russia is currently more interested in developing air-based counters to U.S. stealth penetration platforms than investing in similar capabilities.

3. China

Though it noticeably lags behind its Russian and U.S. competitors China continues to make considerable long-term investments into all of its military branches. With the second-largest military budget and by far the largest fit-for-service pool China’s military exhibits the potential for explosive growth across relatively short periods of time. China’s considerable raw resources are being utilized across a slew of ambitious procurement programs over the coming decades ranging from its own Carrier Strike Groups to a coming fleet of sixth-generation bombers and fighters.

4. India

Despite its relatively small defense budget and lack of military output when compared to the top three world powers India’s military potential stems from its massive labor force and equally impressive fit-for-service pool. India maintains a large even if partially unmodernized tank roster as well as a formidable coastal defense force and robust reserve of artillery pieces. Though it remains a military hardware importer New Delhi has taken recent steps—in large part through licensed production and technology transfer deals—to establish the groundwork for an increasingly self-reliant domestic defense industry.

5. Japan

Japan first supplanted France for fifth-place in 2020 leveraging its wealth comparatively large defense budget and impressive infrastructure. Though it maintains a robust air force and an active presence in select naval categories such as destroyers and submarines Japan’s global ranking is dragged down by its relative lack of ground forces.

On Dec. 10 the final day of its Digital Air Cargo Forum The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) presented the 2020 Air Cargo Sustainability Award to Pelican BioThermal.

The Plymouth Minnesota-based temperature-controlled packaging company was singled out for its work to improve sustainability through the manufacturing and use of Crēdo a durable and reusable temperature-controlled shipping container and similar packaging.

“Our efforts to improve sustainability in manufacturing and our products are far-reaching—helping us and the companies we work with to achieve sustainability goals” says Pelican BioThermal President David Williams. “We are honored that an independent panel of judges recognized the work we are doing to protect our natural resources and the environment as well as advance sustainability within air cargo.”

Runners-up to Pelican BioThermal in the corporate category were skypooling and VRR which also presented solutions in the area of sustainable shipping containers.

Nepal Flying Labs won in the Start-up category for its Drone Optimized Therapy System which flies humanitarian and medical cargo drones to remote and hard-to-reach locations in Nepal.

A total of 23 companies applied to receive Air Cargo Sustainability Awards which recognize those making positive change by supporting social welfare economic development and environmental protection through innovation and partnerships according to TIACA.

Judges who evaluated all the entries are: Chris McDermott CEO CHAMP Cargosystems one of the leading industry IT solutions providers and a partner with TIACA in the Digital Air Cargo Forum; Deniz Kargaci manager of Corporate Sustainability Management Turkish Airlines; Eng Naif Al-Abri CEO of TRANSOM; Steven Polmans director of Cargo and Logistics Brussels Airport; and Susy Schoneberg head of Flexport. They looked at business solutions in carbon and waste reduction drones humanitarian aid packaging ULDs process efficiencies people focus and COVID-19 relief.

“Sustainability4Cargo” was among the topics of discussion during the first week of the forum where it was concluded that sustainability does matter to the air cargo industry having become a real strategic priority for cargo companies many of which have concrete actions in place.

“Our industry remains committed to reducing its environmental footprint and many companies have implemented digital transformation operational improvements and addressed reliability and quality of service issues putting us on track to being more sustainable” states a TIACA follow-up report on Sustainability4Cargo. “The COVID crisis has added a new dimension to sustainability which our industry has rapidly adapted to–resiliency.”

Carriers Get in on the Sustainability Action

Among the Digital Air Cargo Forum sponsors was Polar Air Cargo Worldwide which aims to be the world’s most sustainable cargo airline according to Abilash Kurien the company’s vice president of Marketing Revenue Management & Network Planning.

“To achieve this goal we are focused on digitizing our operations fostering a culture of learning that makes our team best prepared for the future and driving toward environmentally sustainable practices” Kurien says. “These activities are critical for long-term success not just for Polar but for the air cargo industry as a whole.”

Digitization will be key in achieving Polar’s sustainability ambitions he adds. “Digitization will help drive sustainability by eliminating unnecessary steps and decreasing time effort and materials used. E-air waybills for example will reduce paper. AI deployment will result in more efficient planning and reduced fuel consumption.”

Polar also encourages and incentivizes its employees “to raise ideas for more sustainable business practices so that we can minimize our impact on the world around us and ultimately contribute to repairing environmental damage” Kurien says.

“We are on the cusp of evolution in the air cargo industry; the key is embracing the change and working with and listening to the employees who keep the business moving and deliver service for our customers that exceeds expectations. Industry participants that focus on digitization culture and training and environmental sustainability will be at the forefront of the future state of air cargo. With the right vision and an openness to new ideas the possibilities are limitless.”

The vision thing is also at play at United Airlines which in December made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse emissions by 100 percent by 2050. How? Partly by continuing some of its existing initiatives—such as buying carbon offsets; using more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) than any airline globally; and investing in the development of SAF and other decarbonization technology—and partly by funding revolutionary “carbon-capture” technology that is expected to capture and store millions of metric tonnes of CO2 per year.

Chicago-based United is the world’s first airline to commit to investing in Direct Air Capture technology. Specifically the carrier helping 1PointFive build the first industrial-sized Direct Air Capture plant in the country. A single plant is expected to capture and permanently remove 1 million tons of CO2 each year–the equivalent of the work of 40 million trees but covering a land area about 3000 times smaller.

“As the leader of one of the world’s largest airlines I recognize our responsibility in contributing to fight climate change as well as our responsibility to solve it” says Scott Kirby United’s CEO. “These game-changing technologies will significantly reduce our emissions and measurably reduce the speed of climate change–because buying carbon offsets alone is just not enough.

“Perhaps most importantly we’re not just doing it to meet our own sustainability goal; we’re doing it to drive the positive change our entire industry requires so that every airline can eventually join us and do the same.”

“We welcome United’s positive announcement to support the reduction of greenhouse gases” says Patrick R. Gruber CEO of Gevo an Englewood Colorado-based SAF company. “We wholeheartedly agree SAF is the fastest and most effective way United can reduce its emissions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdGxhcy1haXItMjAyMC1wcm9maXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,747 Operator Atlas Air Turns $360m Profit For 2020,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdGxhcy1haXItMjAyMC1wcm9maXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLXR1cm5pbmctcG9pbnQtc2VhLXZveWFnZS1zY2llbnRpc3RzLXdvcnJpZWQtMDYwNjIzNTUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Dangerous turning point': Why this sea voyage has scientists worried,"A historic voyage has been quietly unfolding at the top end of the globe – a trip that promises to have ongoing implications for trade geopolitics and the planet.

For the first time a commercial vessel has sailed across the Northern Sea Route (NSR) during the month of February a time that has historically been unviable due to the prohibitive amount of ice during winter.

A Russian ship carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) has made its way from Jiangsu in China to the remote Arctic terminal of Sabetta in Russia making the historic journey The Barents Observer reported.

Video of the trip has been shared by the shipping company Sovcomflot while its CEO has proclaimed the successful voyage ""expands the navigation window in the eastern sector of the Russian Arctic and confirms that year-round safe navigation is possible.""

The Northern Sea Route which traces the coasts of Siberia and Norway is the region’s busiest artery. It allows cargo ships to save at least 10 days sailing between Europe and Asia.

'A dangerous turning point'

The melting Arctic has been watched closely by countries like China and Russia who are looking to take advantage of the increasingly available shipping lanes. But scientists have lamented the latest milestone and are sounding the alarm about further environmental degradation due to increased shipping activity.

""There is an incentive to seize the economic opportunity of the melting Arctic"" says Associate Professor Nengye Liu an expert in international polar law at Macquarie University.

""This is an ongoing trend"" he told Yahoo News Australia.

""It is also a very dangerous turning point.""

While Russia and China ""are the most active"" in the region's shipping lanes the melting of the Arctic and the Russian permafrost ""has already caused environmental and social problems in those far away communities"" he said.

Harvard professor and lecturer in international security Juliette Kayyem said news of the voyage was a ""consequential"" moment.

""The Arctic has now opened for business year-round the result of climate change. This moment — so consequential you can’t get your head around it — launches a geopolitical struggle for ownership of a place sea routes and ocean resources that were all once uninhabitable"" she tweeted.

Others meanwhile lamented the hastening of the effects of climate change.

""We are in a climate emergency"" said meteorologist and climate journalist Eric Holthaus.

""No multi-year ice. On the northern sea route. In February. Let that sink in a moment"" another Twitter user said.

As a climate person and a former Belt and Road researcher this is just wholly chilling and horrible. https://t.co/lCmJR9g3bi — Josh Wyndham-Kidd (@jlwykidd) February 21 2021

The Northern Sea Route through the Arctic north of Siberia is now open. In February.



There is no multi-year ice left there anymore.

Rise in Arctic shipping traffic set to continue

Both traffic and competition over the strategic sea route is expected to ramp up in the future – a trend that has been playing out in recent years.

That shortcut between Europe and Asia drew ships to make 2694 voyages in 2019 up from 2022 in 2018 1908 in 2017 and 1705 in 2016 according to Nord University’s Centre for High North Logistics.

The increase in shipping is a worry for the environment. As those heavy ships burn fuel they release climate-warming carbon dioxide as well as black soot. That soot blankets nearby ice and snow absorbing solar radiation rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere which exacerbates warming in the region.

While the Polar Code signed in 2017 provides the rules for shipping vessels in the polar regions many of the environmental protections in the code are not mandatory Prof Liu says.

""I don't think it's enough ... the Arctic's ecosystem is so vulnerable.""

The Arctic has already warmed at least twice as fast as the rest of the world over the last three decades. With the region’s warming rate increasing in recent years governments have simply sought to gear up for a future of open Arctic waters.

Russia in particular is driving trade through the region by developing energy and mineral projects in the Arctic. President Vladimir Putin has set a target of transporting 80 million tonnes of cargo annually via the Northern Sea Route by 2025 more than twice what it ships today.

There is also an expectation both China and Russia will seek to control the crucial shipping lanes to the detriment of other nations.

As The Economist pointed out in 2018 year round shipping in the Northern Sea Route is becoming increasingly important.

""The prospects of the NSR would also improve if the world should become less stable. More piracy around the Horn of Africa more congestion in the Strait of Malacca more terrorist attacks in the Suez Canal: all render control of the Northern Sea Route strategically important. Facing little competition from America Russia and China will have the upper hand.""

The carrier’s first flight from Chennai landed at Changi Airport on 20 February at 1115 hrs. Operated under SpiceJet’s cargo arm SpiceXpress using a B737F aircraft the new services will provide additional airfreight capacity between Singapore and India.

SpiceJet launched its cargo operations under SpiceXpress in September 2018 and has since expanded its fleet to 19 cargo aircraft including five widebody aircraft[1]. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic SpiceJet has aided in the transportation of critical goods and medical supplies internationally. The airline has emerged as India’s largest air cargo operator by fleet and cargo carriage[2].

Maintaining connectivity between Singapore and India amid the pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a reduction in global air travel. To address the reduction in bellyhold cargo capacity due to the fall in passenger traffic at Changi Airport Changi Airport Group (CAG) has been working closely with its airline partners who operate the Singapore-India route to ensure that supply chains are kept open. In 2020 India was Changi Airport’s sixth largest air cargo market with cargo tonnage reaching 75000 tonnes for the year.

Between April and December 2020 SpiceJet operated over 230 chartered cargo flights comprising freighter and cargo-only passenger flights between India and Singapore. The air cargo capacity injected by SpiceJet has helped support air trade and the conveyance of humanitarian goods including medical supplies and perishables between the two countries.

In addition to SpiceJet there are four other cargo airlines[3] operating freighter flights between Singapore and India. In 2020 airlines such as Emirates IndiGo Singapore Airlines and SriLankan Airlines have also operated cargo-only passenger flights between India and Singapore.

Mr Lim Ching Kiat CAG’s Managing Director of Air Hub Development said “CAG has been engaging SpiceJet for several years to mount scheduled services to Singapore hence we are pleased to welcome SpiceJet to Changi’s family of airlines. In these challenging times when air cargo capacity is constrained the introduction of SpiceJet’s freighter service is much welcomed. The additional capacity helps support the transportation of essential goods such as medical and food supplies between the two countries.”

Mr Sanjiv Gupta SpiceXpress’s CEO said “We are much delighted to commence our scheduled freighter operations to Singapore. This development would strengthen air trades between the two countries by providing faster and seamless logistics solutions. In addition this strategic move would help SpiceXpress build its network in South East Asia. Singapore is also well-positioned as a springboard for SpiceXpress into other markets such as Europe and Australia.”

In January 2021 Changi Airport handled 146000 tonnes of airfreight throughput in total.The number[4] of weekly cargo flights at Changi Airport has tripled to more than 950 compared to 2019 and the airport is now connected to about 70 cities by weekly cargo flights."

Sometimes you just want sailors who are also literal rats and a hero’s journey that involves turning into a caterpillar to traverse the globe. Strawberry Mansion falls firmly in the latter category. A technicolor dreamscape with vague anti-commercialist messaging it is not only supremely unconcerned with whether or not its surrealist ravings make sense to the audience but it barely seems to occur to filmmakers Kentucky Audley and Albert Birney that somewhere along the line viewers may expect some sort of an explanation. Honestly though? That’s all part of Strawberry Mansion’s charm. Its abstractions make absolutely no sense and they are glorious. Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel would be proud.

The year is 2035 and somehow the government has figured out how to tax people for the contents of their dreams. (And let’s be real: they would if they could.) James Preble (Kentucky Audley) is a bureaucratic drone sent to the home of elderly eccentric Arabella Isadora (Penny Fuller) to audit a lifetime of dreams. This task is easier said than done: Bella has hundreds if not thousands of dusty VHS tapes containing every single one of her dreams and they’ll take ages to peruse. But it isn’t long before Preble becomes unexpectedly caught up in Bella’s dreams charmed by the vision of her younger self (Grace Glowicki) who so frequently makes an appearance. It’s with her aid that Preble makes a startling discovery that threatens to upend his entire worldview and puts his very life in danger.

The first half of Strawberry Mansion functions as a quirky dreamlike romance while the second half attempts to introduce anti-capitalist social commentary. It’s strong in the former where it has the space to float along blissfully abstract and be satisfied with cultivating a uniquely creative atmosphere. Bella’s house is a glory of set decoration packed full of dated rooms outdated technology and memories the world has long since deemed obsolete.

The various dreamscapes capture an engaging kaleidoscope of colors and moods as the filmmakers experiment with half a dozen different animation styles. The vaguely Harold and Maude-ish relationship that develops between Preble and Bella as they get to know one another is sweet despite its strangeness: he’s drawn to the younger version of her but he also has a growing affection for the lonely old woman with all of her quirks and charms.

As a character Preble is muted a mere cog in a larger bureaucratic machine. Audley leans into his more nondescript qualities although it may perhaps be giving him too much credit as an actor to imply that he’s purposefully toning down any sense of charisma to suit the character. But whether by providence or design the mundanity of Preble perfectly serves the narrative a counterbalance to its more fantastical elements.

But as Preble becomes more entrenched in this idyllic dream world he learns the truth about the government’s insidious hold over their nighttime reveries. This is where things begin to get a little bit muddled because everything just sort of spirals into wilder more abstract storytelling until only the barest shreds of a plot remain. There’s an exhilarating sort of charm that comes from going off on a stream-of-consciousness visual tangent for about thirty minutes but it’s definitely not for everyone. Viewers who prefer narratives with at least one foot in the general proximity of the ground may find themselves overwhelmed by the assault of imagery that defines the second half of the film.

Still there’s something to be said for a pair of filmmakers capable of something as delightfully weird as Strawberry Mansion and there’s a certain creative joyfulness that comes through as they allow their imagination to run rampant. For a low-budget production without star power or even a detailed narrative the sheer imagination it contains is completely captivating. If you’re going into this cinematic experience with the expectation of a clearly defined narrative and traditional storytelling you’ll likely wind up disappointed in its stubborn refusal to adhere to filmmaking rules in general. But for viewers who are willing to give it the benefit of the doubt let go of the expectation that storytellers should provide coherent answers (because Audley and Birney certainly won’t) and fully immerse themselves in a dreamy surrealist vibe Strawberry Mansion is a rewarding risk that mostly pays off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi9zaG9wcGluZy9jb2xpbi1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1tYXJrcy1zcGVuY2VyLWVhc3Rlci0xOTg3NzMwNNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay93aGF0cy1vbi9zaG9wcGluZy9jb2xpbi1jYXRlcnBpbGxhci1tYXJrcy1zcGVuY2VyLWVhc3Rlci0xOTg3NzMwNC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&S redesigns Colin the Caterpillar cake after shoppers spot 'nightmare' detail,"Now Easter is on the horizon Marks & Spencer is stocking up on chocolate treats.

Here's What We Know About ABC's Drama Series,"'Once Upon a Time' and its spinoff included a few fan-favorite Disney characters. Now some fans are wondering if they'll return for a Disney+ original series.

There’s already one Disney spinoff of Once Upon a Time available on the company’s streaming platform. Will fans ever return to the world of Storybrooke and “happily ever after?” Here’s what we know about the ABC drama series.

‘Once Upon a Time’ earned its own ‘Alice in Wonderland’ themed spinoff

All magic comes at a price. When the Evil Queen decided to bring fairy tale characters into the real world she wasn’t planning on “the Chosen One” named Emma to set them free. Eventually these characters discovered their true identities and lived happily ever in Storybrooke.

Then fans traveled to Wonderland for a live-action spinoff featuring Cheshire Cat a hookah-smoking caterpillar and talking playing cards titled Once Upon A Time In Wonderland. The spinoff series only on the television network ABC for one season 13 episodes in 2013 and 2014.

The show’s official description according to Inside the Magic reads “Alice tells of a land on the far side of a rabbit hole which holds a disappearing cat and talking playing cards — not to mention her lost love Cyrus a handsome genie. But her tales don’t play well in Victorian England; doctors believe she is mad and Alice begins to agree with them.”

“They plan a treatment that will make her memories disappear” the description continues. “Luckily — before the doctors can follow through — the Knave of Hearts and the White Rabbit arrive to whisk her away to the place where anything is possible: Wonderland.”

‘Once Upon A Time In Wonderland’ is available for streaming on Disney+

This wouldn’t be the first time Once Upon a Time viewers traveled to this magical wonderland. One of the residents in Storybrooke was Jefferson portrayed by Sebastian Stan. This character and his hat proved to be useful for characters like Emma and Regina.

However the character was known by other characters as the “Mad Hatter” always searching for his missing daughter. Unlike Snow White and Emma the Mad Hatter only appeared in a few episodes of the drama series. Without the character Once Upon a Time ran on ABC for seven seasons.

Once Upon a Time and Once Upon A Time In Wonderland were both ABC original series that have since made the switch to Disney’s streaming platform with the spinoff just joining the service during November 2020.

Will another ‘Once Upon a Time’ spinoff premiere on Disney+?

Since its premiere Once Upon a Time made the switch to Disney’s streaming platform Disney+ where all episodes are available for binge-watching. However there’s no word regarding if the streaming service would ever make another spinoff of the drama series.

A new Once Upon a Time-based series isn’t completely out of the question though as Disney created original series’ based on characters from Marvel Pixar and Star Wars.

Several Disney+ original series’ like High School Musical: The Musical: The Series Diary of a Future President and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available for binge-watching.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS93b3JsZC1vZi13YXJjcmFmdC1lbnQtbmV3LW1vdW50LXRoZS1hbmNpZW50LW9uZS1jaGFpbnMtb2YtZG9taW5hdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Of Warcraft Lets You Live Out Your Ent Fantasy With A New Mount,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS93b3JsZC1vZi13YXJjcmFmdC1lbnQtbmV3LW1vdW50LXRoZS1hbmNpZW50LW9uZS1jaGFpbnMtb2YtZG9taW5hdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Atlanta-based IDI Logistics has broken ground on Brea Logistics Center a 108125-square-foot project at 201 N. Berry St.

The new development a few blocks north of the Riverside (91) Freeway close to Albertsons’ sprawling distribution center in the city comes as demand for new industrial development in Orange County hits new highs with “new construction often seeing strong interest from prospective tenants and commanding higher than average market rents” according to a brokerage report by CBRE Group Inc.

It’s IDI Logistics’ only local project currently in the works for now.

The company which typically builds in infill markets in Los Angeles and Northern California acquired a vacant neighboring site on South Berry Street at the end of last year signaling another new industrial project could be in the works.

Brea Logistics Center

IDI Logistics acquired the 5.2-acre North Berry site at the end of 2019 for $13.3 million.

Situated near the intersection of North Berry Street and West Lambert Road the parcel held an 80000-square-foot industrial property that’s being demolished to make way for the new development.

An affiliate of Houston-based NOV or National Oilwell Varco LP was the tenant and seller trading the property for about $2.6 million per acre and relocating to the Inland Empire.

Brea Logistics Center will have one building on the site along with 129 parking spaces.

Neighboring Potential

Across the street IDI Logistics acquired a 6.2-acre parcel at 114 S. Berry for $24.1 million or $3.9 million per acre.

It bought the site at the end of last year from the tenant Blaine Convention Services which vacated the 109060-square-foot facility prior to the sale.

IDI’s plans for the site have yet to be disclosed.

The company is reported to have one other local property in its portfolio at 6600 Valley View St. in Buena Park.

North County Development

According to CBRE there is nearly 900000 square feet of industrial space currently under construction in the county representing less than 0.4% of the region’s existing inventory.

Brea Logistics Center represents about half the total square footage of inventory under construction in North County.

Among larger projects in Orange County that have yet to break ground: a 1.5 million-square-foot logistics site to be built at the former Kimberly-Clark tissue paper manufacturing site in Fullerton.

Plans have been in the works since the end of 2019 when it sold for $202 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of February 22,"Market sentiment continues to be centered around the government’s stimulus package which is expected to be finalized late next week after the recent revision. Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

Two days before the storm began Houston's chief elected official warned her constituents to prepare as they would for a major hurricane. Many took heed: Texans who could stocked up on food and water while nonprofits and government agencies set out to help those who couldn't.

But few foresaw the fiasco that was to come. They could not be prepared.

As temperatures plunged and snow and ice whipped the state much of Texas' power grid collapsed followed by its water systems. Tens of millions huddled in frigid homes that slowly grew colder or fled for safety. And a prideful state long suspicious of regulation and outside help was left to seek aid from other states and humanitarian groups as many of its 29 million people grasped for survival.

Images of desperate Texans circulated worldwide. To some they evoked comparisons to a less wealthy or self-regarding place. To others they laid bare problems that have long festered.

A week after she warned her county's nearly 5 million residents about the impending storm Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo was sleeping on an air mattress at the county's emergency operations center. Her home had been without power for three nights.

""It's worth asking the question: Who set up this system and who perpetuated it knowing that the right regulation was not in place?"" Hidalgo said.

Around 2 a.m. Monday the full measure of the crisis Texas faced began to be apparent.

Cold and ice had set in the day before leading to spreading power outages across the state. But standing in the emergency operations center early Monday Hidalgo and others learned that their local energy provider CenterPoint Energy would not be able to ""roll"" outages between homes as they had been told earlier.

Instead of short intervals of heat enough to keep their homes safe residents would have to go without for days on end.

Power outages spiraled through the day Monday ultimately cutting off more than 4 million people. Grocery stores shut down and hotel rates skyrocketed.

People who fled to the homes of relatives or neighbors had to consider the risks of contracting or spreading coronavirus.

Ashley Archer and her husband decided to take in his best friend at their suburban Dallas home. She is pregnant and has been trying to protect herself from the virus for nearly a year.

The friend is ""like family"" she said. ""We weren't going to let him freeze at his place.""

Things got worse Tuesday. Thousands of people sought refuge from their freezing homes in warming shelters. Others sat in their cars; dozens were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning. A woman and her daughter died after running their car inside a garage.

At her Dallas condominium 51-year-old Stephanie Murdoch layered in blankets two pairs of pants two sweaters three pairs of socks a hat and gloves. Her anger grew at the power companies and their apparent lack of preparation.

""We've got another blast of snow coming in this evening ... and still no clear answers as to why the grids aren't working better"" she said.

By Wednesday some started to get their power back but a new shortage emerged—drinkable water.

Frozen pipes burst across the state. And the water that did come out of taps was often undrinkable due to dangerously low water pressure levels. At one point an estimated 13 million people were under a boil-water order nearly half of Texas' population.

More than 35 people in Texas have been confirmed dead. That number was expected to rise as roads cleared and relatives and first responders could check on missing loved ones.

Mark Henry Galveston County's judge asked the state early in the week to send a refrigerated truck requested by the local medical examiner who expected an influx of bodies.

""If they had been honest with us from the beginning we would have ordered evacuations. But they didn't tell us that"" he said.

The disaster can be traced to mistakes by Texas' leadership and faults created by decades of opposition to more regulations and preparation.

Basically the state is an island in the U.S. electrical system.

There is one large grid covering the Eastern half of the country another for the West with Texas wedged between them. There is a long and colorful history to how this came to be but the simplest explanation is that Texas utilities wanted to be free of federal regulation. They accomplished that going back to the middle of the last century by avoiding sending power across state lines.

The Texas grid isn't walled off but there are only a few small interconnection points with the Eastern U.S. grid and Mexico. In the past utility executives have argued that the Texas grid would be less reliable and more vulnerable to blackouts if it were fully connected to the rest of the country – which would make it easier for other states to tap Texas during their own shortages.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT was created in 1970; it became a more powerful broker over electricity flows after deregulation in this century. In the wake of the storm it has taken most of the blame from Texas politicians and the public.

Despite efforts by some Republicans to blame clean energy the failures occurred in every part of the sector. While wind turbines and solar panels froze a major nuclear plant lost half of its generation and there were massive failures in coal oil and natural gas. Demand surged meanwhile as people accustomed to mild Texas winters turned on their heat.

In 2011 millions of Texans lost power during the Super Bowl which was played in a Dallas suburb. Two agencies the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation conducted a study on how Texas could ""winterize"" its energy infrastructure. At the highest end winterizing 50000 gas wells would cost an estimated $1.75 billion the study found.

Of the 2011 storm the report said generators and natural gas producers said they had ""winterization procedures in place. However the poor performance of many of these generating units and wells suggests that these procedures were either inadequate or were not adequately followed.""

But there was no broad move to winterize equipment. Since then bills requiring energy producers to hold more power in reserve or ordering a study of how to better prepare for winter failed in the Republican-controlled Texas House.

Texas lawmakers deregulated the energy market in 2002. Supporters say this lowered energy prices statewide but critics say it gave producers leeway to avoid improvements that might have prevented events like this week's catastrophe.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has promised multiple investigations of this storm and made ERCOT an ""emergency"" item for the legislature which is currently in its biennial session.

""I think there is going to have to be a serious inquiry into why it was what were the factors that led the grid not to be able to meet the energy needs of Texas"" said Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.

Cruz spoke Thursday evening in the yard of his home in Houston's wealthiest neighborhood River Oaks. He had cut short a trip to Cancun Mexico after images circulated of him waiting at a Houston airport for his flight to the resort town.

At week's end as the cold weather began to loosen its grip the power grid came back online for most Texans. But burst pipes had flooded thousands of homes. Earlier in the week Abbott had asked plumbers from other states to come to Texas and help.

But fixing pipes is one thing. Fixing a whole state is another.

It dragged Futu into the limelight along with the largest no-commission online broker Robinhood when Li’s customers were barred from buying additional shares in GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings. Even though the suspension was eased within 24 hours the episode drew an uncomfortable comparison with Robinhood which sells customers’ online orders to high-frequency brokers or market makers like Citadel Securities. Li founder of Futu had envisioned creating China’s Charles Schwab when he established the online broker in 2012.

Li Hua who also goes by “Leaf” personally negotiated with his dealers in the United States to unfreeze transactions so that customers of Futu Holdings’ internet-only trading platform in mainland China and Hong Kong could join in the chase for the shares of GameStop  an unprofitable retailer of speciality electronic games in Grapevine Texas.

In late January when the “Nerds vs Wall Street” battle was at its most intense on the New York Stock Exchange one of China’s most promising technology entrepreneurs was catching very few winks 13 hours away in Shenzhen.

“We are not like [Robinhood] because they sell order flows in exchange for letting customers trade for free” Li said in an interview with South China Morning Post in Shenzhen. “That’s not a business [model] that we are getting involved in at least for now.”

Futu is the biggest in a new crop of stockbrokers in China that exist 100 per cent online eschewing the type of bricks-and-mortar trading halls and viewing galleries frequented by the nation’s legions of pensioner investors. The number of China’s share-trading accounts ballooned to 178 million in December  according to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation making this the world’s eighth-largest cluster of people behind Nigeria’s population.

“Online stock trading in China topped the world in 2018 with 31 per cent of the market showing the steadily rising demand of investors using online channels for their transactions” according to First Shanghai Securities’ analyst Li Jinglin in a January 22 report. “Compared with traditional brokerages with bricks-and-mortar shops online brokers that focus on online trading have improved efficiency relatively lower commission rates and fees after they cut their overheads and they are better able to win over loyal customers with their cost advantage.”

Comprising mostly millennials who came of age in 2000 or even some Gen Z traders born in the 21st century these young customers prefer simple do-it-yourself systems that let them trade from the convenience of their ubiquitous smartphones. Lower transaction fees were also a big plus encouraging more traders to get in and out of positions more frequently even with smaller wins.

“The simplicity of our service enables us to cater to all levels of customers whether they are beginners or experienced investors who require more in-depth features and analysis” Li said at his head office on Yuehai Street  one of China’s wealthiest neighbourhoods measured by gross domestic product.

The street cutting through the Nanshan district in the heart of what is dubbed “China’s Silicon Valley” is the marquee address for the technology industry home to such home-grown champions as Huawei Technologies  ZTE Tencent Holdings and the drone maker DJI

The simplicity of the model served Li well helping Futu chalk up 10.4 million user accounts as of September 30 including inactive ones.Tiger Brokers – backed by one of China’s largest smartphone makers Xiaomi – had 1 million active user accounts at the end of November a company spokesperson said.

Futu’s commission is 0.05 per cent with the minimum amount set at HK$50 (US$6.4) except for new users in certain periods compared with 0.03 per cent in commission fees plus 0.03 per cent platform fees by Tiger Brokers and 0.25 per cent by Huatai International with a minimum amount of HK$100.

A decade earlier when Li had just struck out on his own stockbroking was a different business. Dominated by brokerages affiliated with large state-owned banks the industry was a tightly regulated market heavily ring-fenced by rules to damp price swings prevent capital flight and provide the population a one-way bet for ever higher prices.

It was also a business that was in no rush to innovate. Investors domiciled in mainland China collectively sitting on the world’s largest currency reserves had few avenues for trading offshore due to the nation’s tightly controlled capital accounts. Until a cross-border investment channel called the Connect was established with Hong Kong in 2014 they could not trade any of the Chinese companies listed on the city’s exchange from state companies such as China Mobile Limited to tech champions such as Tencent. Trading of US-listed stocks was off-limits.

Such was the market situation that drew Li who turns 44 this year to abandon a promising career in what would become China’s most valuable company to strike out on his own.

Li who studied computer science joined Tencent in 2000 two years after graduating from Hunan University in central China. His English name Leaf is a homophone of his Chinese name in his native Changsha dialect.

Joining the then start-up Li worked alongside Tencent’s founder Pony Ma Huateng helping to develop the QQ messaging service that helped to connect people from far-flung regions around China. QQ still in use today by 600 million active users every month would turn out to be one of Tencent’s most successful products. After two years of working on QQ Li was promoted to head a division at Tencent charged with creating video content.

Tencent went public in 2004 raising HK$1.79 billion in an initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company’s shares have jumped almost 200 times since going public valuing Tencent at HK$7.08 trillion as the sixth-largest publicly traded company on earth.

As a middle-ranking manager and one of the earliest employees – he was staff No. 18 – Li was rewarded with share options that turned into instant wealth. Tencent’s listing in Hong Kong also gave Li an early peek at how the stock market worked giving him first-hand experience of investing across different currencies and markets as well as having to navigate different regulatory requirements.

Frustrated with the prevailing stockbrokerage services that were cumbersome expensive and inefficient Li struck out to develop his own trading platform. He wanted to create a Chinese version of Charles Schwab the pioneer of electronic trading platforms discount brokers and no-fee trading that is now the world’s third-largest asset manager behind BlackRock and Vanguard.

He left Tencent in 2008 to focus on his venture picking the date – four days after Valentine’s Day – of his eighth anniversary as his last day at the company according to his blog. He had not even told his parents about his resignation causing them to wonder if he had been fired for misconduct he wrote.

The early days were hard as he struggled to raise capital and to navigate the underdeveloped market for online stockbroking.

“If I was given another chance I may not choose to start my own business” Li said. “That’s not to say I regret becoming an entrepreneur but many things were far more difficult than I originally thought.”

Three years would go by before his product was ready to launch. For Futu to progress from vision to reality Li said he had Tencent to thank both for eight years of working in one of China’s largest technology companies and for its financial backing.

“Most people lack the ability to believe especially the ability to believe in the future … Many people believe it after they see it happen” he said adding that his experience at Tencent made it “very easy” for him to believe the future.

Tencent also became one of the earliest investors in Li’s start-up. China’s largest publicly traded company is now Futu’s second-largest shareholder owning 18.9 per cent of its class A shares an 25.9 per cent of Class B shares.

Futu is the largest of a new crop of online brokerages that embraced the constantly changing needs of their users. Besides Xiaomi-backed Tiger Brokers Ant Group – an affiliate of this newspaper’s owner Alibaba Group Holding – also has an investment in Snowball Securities.

Online brokers have disrupted the traditional brokerage segment over the years benefiting from a surge in direct financing. China recorded double-digit growth in the number of securities apps users between December 2016 and July 2020 according to iMedia Research.

Fintech institutions – those technology behemoths that are venturing into financial services  like Ant Group Xiaomi and Tencent itself – will record a bigger growth as the trading volume of global capital markets grows while people increasingly accept online trading amid technology development said First Securities’ Li.

A lower growth of new users lower-than-expected market activities and possibly tighter regulation could pose risks for Futu the analyst said.

“Online brokers have the advantage in costs so traditional brokers will lose their competence if they don’t diversify their businesses” Futu’s founder said. “Their brand franchise experience and the accumulation of human relations should be what they must focus on.”

Futu now employs more than 1300 around the world. Its stock has risen 15-fold since its 2019 initial public offering in New York valuing the company at US$24.5 billion about a fifth the capitalisation of Charles Schwab founded half a century ago in 1971. Subscriptions of the company’s Futu Money Plus fund reached more than HK$10 billion at the end of 2020.

The company is making a push into the Singapore  using the country as its stepping stone to tap Southeast Asia allowing Chinese investors to trade the region’s stocks.

Futu’s growth has turned Li into China’s 66th-weathiest billionaire according to Bloomberg estimating his fortunes at US$9.3 billion through a 40-per cent stake in Futu making him the stockbroking industry’s 11th-richest broker.

Recriminations continue in the United States over the GameStop mania with Robinhood’s 34-year-old chief executive Vlad Tenev being called to testify to the US Congress this week about the temporary trading restriction placed on the stock. Thankfully for Li Futu is spared the scrutiny.

“Futu is actively communicating with upstream channels to enhance trading channel capacity” Li said two weeks ago when the Chinese broker had to follow its US dealers in restricting transactions adding that the company will continue to vet new customers before opening accounts and increase risk alerts to users. “We are also planning a new round of capacity expansion in the Hong Kong market to ensure customers’ orders are processed quickly and smoothly.”

This is contained in a filed affidavit by Irene Kaggwa Sewankambo the executive director of UCC in support of the Attorney General's response to National Unity Platform (NUP) Robert Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine's presidential election petition.

""There were 320 operational radio stations across the country over 45 television stations on-air mobile and fixed telephone connection remained on and people freely called and enjoyed short message services (SMS) and multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) through these communication platforms.""



However the shutdown affected businesses such as apps online and financial sector players. Reuters news agency says that Netblocks an internet freedom monitor calculated that the five-day internet shutdown cost the economy close to $9 million (about Shs 33 billion). The financial sector was losing about Shs 66 billion a day.

Sewamkambo is among the 76 witnesses whose affidavits have been filed in the Supreme court as evidence by the Attorney General to defend President Yoweri Museveni's election victory.

Kyagulanyi alleges that the election was not conducted in accordance with provisions of the 1995 Uganda Constitution the Electoral Commission Act the East African Community Treaty the African Charter on Democracy and Governance and other relevant laws.

For instance Kyagulanyi says that the Electoral Commission and Attorney General breached sections 23 and 24 of the Presidential Elections Act that provide for equal treatment freedom of expression and access to information of candidates and rights of candidates to access state media.



Kyagulanyi says the EC and AG failed to ensure freedom and fairness during the election when the UCC ""switched off or caused the switching off of the internet and mobile money services thereby curtailing the free flow of information within the electorate and resource facilitation to agents of the petitioner.""

NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

Sewankambo in her affidavit says the order to shut down internet bulk messaging and mobile money services temporarily came from the National Security Council that cited national security reasons. She says that on 13th January 2021 Gen. Elly Tumwine the minister of Security wrote a letter to UCC regarding the council's decision. The NCS is made up of cabinet ministers and top security officials in the army and police.



Tumwine noted that ""in the interest of national security it has been deemed necessary by the National Security Council to have the following modes of communication suspended temporarily; internet services bulk SMS messaging services and mobile money if necessary.""



The letter of 46 words resulted in UCC directing all telecom companies to shut down the internet by 7 pm on the eve of the election.



Sewankambo supports the move saying that it was based on reports of misuse of social media platforms and incidents of violations including publication and broadcasting of sectarian content and character assassination of political actors on particularly Facebook Youtube and Twitter.



Also she claims that there were ""reports of planned cyber attacks on especially government networks and other systems in the country"".

'FACEBOOK TO BLAME'

Sewakambo adds that UCC had on its own monitored the use of social media platforms and noted a lot of incidents of violation of Ugandan laws. Due to the continued misuse of social media it prompted UCC ""to engage telecommunication providers and social media companies to institute measures to avoid the misuse of their respective networks to compromise national security.""

However ""efforts to engage social media companies such as Facebook Youtube and Twitter proved futile as they did not show commitment and capacity to monitor their respective platform users"" says Sewankambo. As a result she says disconnection of the internet was ""intended to facilitate a free and fair election.""



Last December UCC asked the above companies to block Ghetto TV and 13 NUP leaning online platforms for publishing content likely to mislead and incite violence against people based on their tribe and political affiliations.



A few days to the election Facebook however blocked several accounts and pages of government and NRM supporters because they were misleading people on who they are or what they do in order to target public debate ahead of the election.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Bloomberg) --Egypt and Israel said they may build an undersea natural-gas pipeline connecting the two countries as they seek to collaborate on exporting the fuel to Europe.

The pipeline would link Israel’s huge Leviathan field to Egypt’s liquefied natural gas plants the countries’ energy ministries said Sunday. Egypt added that the two sides would work on a governmental framework for the pipeline.

The announcement comes as nations in the eastern Mediterranean ramp up investments in offshore gas fields. Egypt is seeking to become a major hub for exporting LNG to Europe where demand is growing as governments transition from dirtier fossil fuels such as coal and oil.

The new pipeline would allow Israel to export more gas to Egypt. It can currently send 7 billion cubic meters a year through the EMG pipeline that runs to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula.

The latest agreement came as Oil Minister Tarek El-Molla made a rare visit to Israel for an Egyptian official. He met his counterpart Yuval Steinitz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They discussed working with other countries to convert ships to use natural gas instead of petroleum. El-Molla also traveled to the Palestinian city of Ramallah.

Chevron Corp. and other companies are separately investing hundreds of millions of dollars to help transport Israeli gas to Egypt.

LNG Restart

Egypt is increasing exports from its own fields including Zohr. The Golar Glacier an LNG-carrying vessel arrived at Damietta to load 60000 tons of the super-chilled fuel according to a cabinet statement Sunday and ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.

The tanker’s arrival marks the return of the country’s second LNG plant after an eight-year hiatus. Damietta’s restart was repeatedly delayed amid a dispute over gas supplies.

Egypt has spearheaded the establishment of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. The group which also includes Cyprus Greece Israel Italy Jordan and the Palestinians is meant to boost cooperation among the region’s gas producers and transit countries. Turkey which has raised tensions by exploring for gas in contested waters is not as yet included.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fast food wants to be a force in fast fashion.

McDonald’s (MCD) latest non-edible creation is a hoodie timed to coincide with the launch of its new crispy chicken sandwiches. Dunkin’ (DNKN) launched a wedding “kit” of matrimonial products and Chipotle (CMG) has tapped the universe of TikTok stars for its newest T-shirt launch.

While fast food chains regularly sell clothing and experiences to create buzz there’s a reason they’re ramping up the effort during the pandemic said Andrew Charles restaurant sector analyst with Cowen.

Charles said clothing featuring your favorite products is a good low-cost way for restaurants to keep your favorite restaurant top of mind. “It’s another avenue for companies like McDonald’s to do this outside of TV (ads)” said Charles. This has become more important during the pandemic as people eat out less frequently.

As a marketing move Charles said fast food chains tapping into influencers to create one-of-a-kind merchandise is a “home run.” “This is already a mature industry that needs to appeal to younger Millennial and Gen Z consumers” he said.

Here are some of the latest in fast food fashions:

McDonald’s chicken hoodie

McDonald's Crispy Chicken Sandwich Hoodie McDonald's

The latest menu-inspired swag from McDonald’s includes a nod to the ever-popular crispy chicken sandwich. The chain is currently locked in a battle with rivals in that category.

McDonald’s said it will sell a limited number of $5 swag packages via a special website that includes among other things a hoodie with a picture of its new Crispy Chicken Sandwich with the slogan “crispyjuicytender.”

The gift box also includes vinyl recording of a song about the sandwich from music producer Tay Keith and a gift card to redeem for the sandwich one day prior to its official release at restaurants.

McDonald’s (MCD) has recently sold other merchandise tied to food including projects with musicians Travis Scott and J. Balvin. Scott’s fashion collaboration with the chain sold for as much as hundreds of dollars more than originally priced on the resale market according to the online marketplace StockX.

Chipotle puts a meme on T-shirts:

Chipotle's T-shirt collaboration with Roy Murray. Chipotle Mexican Grill

For its latest merch drop Chipotle turned to a 12-year-old TikTok sensation for some help. The chain teamed up with Roy Murray aka the “Chipotle Is My Life” Kid for a limited edition clothing launch for its Chipotle Goods collection.

Chipotle decided to screenshot little Roy from the viral video and put the meme on T-shirts.

There’s more. For $28 Chipotle loyalists can also score a “Chipotle Is My Life” meme running down the sleeves of a long sleeve white T-shirt. The company said it’s donating all profits from the collection to organizations focused on making fashion or farming more sustainably.

In 2020 Chipotle said it would utilize the chain’s used avocado pits that would otherwise have gone to waste to dye a new collection of its T-shirts sweatshirts and tote bags.

The pandemic has already thrown the wedding industry for a loop.

Dunkin’ just unveiled all kinds of paraphernalia online including a Dunkin’ bride satin robe a Dunkin’-patterned bow tie and ring bearer pillow and even a Dunkin’-themed veil.

“As new weddings are planned and some are rescheduled from last year we’re excited to make it easier for coffee and donut loving couples everywhere to bring a little more Dunkin’ into their celebration” Melanie Rabino director of brand engagement at Dunkin’ said in a statement.",,,,,,

Surrounded by scaffolded raked seating the machines face the baroque altar that divides the two cavernous spaces in Venice’s Church of San Lorenzo home to TBA21–Academy Ocean Space. While the machines are not in use a quiet chanting can be heard inspired by the Tongan traditional choral ritual of the Me’etu’upaki which translates as “dance” (me’e); “standing” (tu’u); “with paddles” (paki). The chanting is amplified when visitors activate the machines; the more people join in the louder it becomes.

The piece is designed to raise awareness of the dangers of deep-sea mining in the Pacific. Indigenous Pacific Island people are among those most impacted by the climate crisis; they are already encountering the devastating effects of sea-level rise extreme weather events and species loss. Taumoepeau comes from a lineage of Tongan deep-sea navigators who for generations have safeguarded the myriad species of fish coral and seagrass that inhabit the surrounding ocean. Her installation is a call for collective care and ecological responsibility on both local and global scales.

“Deep Communion sung in minor” is one part of Re-Stor(y)ing Oceania curated as a call and response by artist Taloi Havini. The “response” to Taumoepeau’s work is architect Elisapeta Hinemoa Heta’s “The Body of Wainuiātea” in the adjoining exhibition space which encourages viewers to participate in a more contemplative capacity. Instead of paddling members of the public are able to step onto an earthen brick platform and take one of 16 seats positioned in relation to the sun’s rising and setting.

The interpretive materials introduce visitors to Oceanic vocabulary primarily Tongan and Maori. These terms are presented in the original language followed by the English or Italian translation in brackets alluding to Havini’s foregrounding of Indigenous Pacific beliefs as holistic systems with much to teach us.

Heta’s installation draws on the Māori concept of Tikanga an untranslatable term that suggests a system of customs behaviors and ethics encouraging balance between human beings and our environments. The artist is a Māori Samoan and Tokelauan leader and advocate for legal and social reform creating spaces in which oppressed or forgotten narratives can come to the fore such as those of Indigenous and female voices. Here visitors are invited to become part of the discussion sitting in a circle symbolizing togetherness and equality.

One problem with participatory art is that visitors can be too self-conscious to join in particularly without explicit encouragement. When I visited however members of a boys’ basketball team were exerting themselves with youthful zeal on Taumoepeau’s gondolier machines enthusiastically amplifying the sound until it reverberated powerfully through the space. After they left the space reverted to the reverential hush inspired by the ecclesiastical setting — and the installation lost much of its vivacity.

The exhibition is accompanied by a program of performances and children’s workshops. Yet most of the time Taumoepeau’s installation and Heta’s complementary piece both meant to be activated by participants will be left untouched and feel perhaps somewhat incomplete. Although both installations are substantial they are dwarfed by the vastness of the Church of San Lorenzo and thus lack immediate visual impact.

Nevertheless the exhibition covers important ground platforming compelling ideas around Indigeneity and climate change that may be unfamiliar to some viewers. Given the opportunity to both sit quietly with the show’s complex ideas and experience the works brought to life by performance or participation visitors should come away with a powerful sense of the devastation faced by Pacific Islanders — and the beauty of the beliefs and ecosystems that may soon be lost.

Re-Stor(y)ing Oceania continues at TBA21–Academy Ocean Space (Campo San Lorenzo 5067 Venice Italy) through October 13. The exhibition was co-commissioned by TBA21–Academy and Artspace produced in partnership with OGR Torino and curated by Taloi Havini.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M1Y2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvY2h1cmNoLWluLW9sZC1icm9va2x5bi10YXJnZXRlZC1ieS10aGlldmVzLWFnYWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church in Old Brooklyn targeted by thieves again,"CLEVELAND — The Pearl Road United Methodist Church has been part of the fabric of Old Brooklyn Church Leaders said for more than 200 years.

The church hosts a farmer’s market has a blessings box outside and allows the community to use its space to host meetings.

“We try to do everything for the community. We have a trailer that we put out that goes down Pearl Road to the developments taking food. They go under the bridges taking food to people blankets” said Tom Hites chairman of the Trustees Pearl Road United Methodist Church.

Yet someone took what didn’t belong to them—a burglar busted through the front door window. Once inside the thief wasn’t deterred by deadbolts on interior doors that were put up to bolster security after a previous break-in. According to Hites the church crooks got into an office and stole about $35 from an envelope a few gift cards a couple of dollars from a desk and a candy bar.

Fred Hodges has called Old Brooklyn home twice. Once as a child now as an adult. He’s involved in trying to keep the community safe. He’s disturbed by the latest burglary at the church.

“To break into a church is so brazen and desperate to do things like that. It’s just terrible. These people have no soul” said Hodges.

The church is tightening up security again. It has already added lights and locks and is now looking at cameras and security systems. Hites said all the thief needed to do was ask for help.

“That’s what people do; they come in and they ask and we take care of them. They don’t need to break in” explained Hites.

Last year two historic lights from outside the church were stolen; those lights have never been found.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

Pennsylvania State Police have charged Bernard Polite 26 of Braddock after he entered and attempted to shoot pastor Glenn Germany while the pastor was delivering a sermon at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church on Sunday. Pastor Glenn Germany / Facebook

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is working with multiple law enforcement agencies to track down the man."

Genevieve woman Friday to 16 months in prison on each of four counts of wire fraud to be served concurrently.

27-year-old Kayla Childress pleaded guilty last February to those federal charges.

Childress was employed by Bloomsdale Excavating.

Childress was the Administrative Clerk for that company and was responsible for overseeing credit card accounts belonging to Bloomsdale Excavating and used by company employees.

Childress was responsible for checking the company’s credit card statements for charges and reconciling charges with receipts for such charges coding the account charges to jobs projects and work performed by the company and entering the information into the company accounting system.

Beginning on or about July 13th 2017 and continuing through about December 1st 2018 Childress devised a scheme to defraud Bloomsdale Excavating by directing payments from the company’s Commerce Bank Visa credit cards to her personal accounts or accounts controlled by her including PayPal accounts owned by her.

Bloomsdale Excavating suffered financial losses of $246673 stolen by Childress.

The company’s insurance company paid $241673 toward the loss in a claim for the fraud.

Childress is responsible for repayment of restitution of $ 5000.00 to Bloomsdale Excavating and $241673 to Cincinnati Insurance Company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmd0aGVsaW5lcy5jb20vcGxheWVyLWFuYWx5c2lzL3BsYXllci1hbmFseXNpcy1icmVubmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Player Analysis: Brenner – Breaking The Lines,"The last few years have proven that MLS has transformed from a “retirement league” to a top exporter of young talents. Alphonso Davies Miguel Almirón and Tyler Adams are just a handful of the players who have gone from playing in MLS to starting in top five leagues. Rather than go for declining big-name stars such as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Andrea Pirlo more and more American teams are utilizing their economic force to sign promising young South American players.

After winning the Copa Sudamericana Ezequiel Barco left Independiente to link up with his compatriot Gerardo ‘Tata’ Martino at Atlanta United who would go on to win the MLS Cup on the back of a 31-goal season from Venezuelan striker Josef Martínez. Eight months after losing in the Copa Libertadores Final Cristian Pavón joined LA Galaxy on loan from Boca Juniors. Brian Rodríguez and Diego Rossi departed Peñarol to test their skills in Los Angeles FC whilst Cristian Cásseres Jr. left Deportivo La Guaira to take flight at New York Red Bulls.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic teams have been forced to tighten their belts and find new cheaper ways to strengthen their squads. According to a recent FIFA report the number of transfers decreased by 36.2% whilst the collective transfer spend decreased by 49.1% in comparison to January 2020. More and more MLS teams have taken advantage of the pandemic’s economic repercussions using their financial strength to pounce on relatively vulnerable South American sides and sign promising youngsters.

Portland Timbers purchased Claudio Bravo from Banfield for an undisclosed fee Déiber Caicedo left Deportivo Cali for Vancouver Whitecaps whilst Argentine talents Santiago Sosa and Tomás Pochettino headed for Atlanta United and Austin FC respectively. Arguably the biggest move occurred in Ohio when FC Cincinnati purchased Brenner from São Paulo.

Since being announced as the latest expansion franchise on May 29 2018 FC Cincinnati have struggled to make a lasting impact in MLS. The club finished with a league-worst 6-22-6 record in their inaugural season setting a record for the most goals conceded in a single season (75). They did not fare much better the following year under manager Jaap Stam finishing 14th in the Eastern Conference with a dismal 4-15-4 record although they did manage to impress in the ‘MLS is Back’ tournament finishing second in a group of Columbus Crew Atlanta United and New York Red Bulls before being eliminated by Portland in the Round of 16.

Given the fact that Brenner had already been linked with European giants such as Juventus Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain his arrival in Cincinnati caught many by surprise. In a recent interview FC Cincinnati General Manger Gerard Nijkamp stated “Normally this kind of talent goes directly to Europe but now he’s coming to our club. In the past there was a lot of opportunities for top Brazilian talents to go directly to Europe but we took this opportunity. Brenner is an impact addition which will help a glaring need for us: Scoring goals.”

Whilst São Paulo were originally demanding the full payment of Brenner’s €50 million release clause they were forced to settle for a fee of €12 million for the 21-year-old forward as Cincinnati took advantage of the Tricolor club’s financial difficulties and snapped him up for a lower price. “These are difficult times for clubs…in a normal world it would be tougher for a club like FC Cincinnati…we made the investment and put the money on the table” said Nijkamp.

Born in Cuiabá Brazil on January 16 2000 Brenner joined São Paulo’s academy at 11 years of age polishing his skills in the same Cotia training ground that produced other talented attackers such as David Neres Anthony Oscar Luiz Araújo and Lucas Mouri. He was given his professional debut by legendary Tricolor goalkeeper and current Flamengo manager Rogério Ceni coming on as a substitute in a 0-1 defeat to Club Athletico Paranaense.

He would make just one more substitute appearance before jetting off for India to participate in the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Alongside the likes of Paulinho (Bayer Leverkusen) Vitão and Marcos Antônio ( Shakhtar Donetsk) and Yuri Alberto (Internacional) Brenner impressed on the left flank and scored three goals throughout the tournament. Brazil advanced to the semifinals before being eliminated by the eventual champions England who booked their ticket to the Final via a hat-trick from Rhian Brewster.

Despite scoring his first professional goal in the final matchday of his debut campaign a 1-1 draw against Bahia Brenner struggled for playing time in the 2018 season making just 6 appearances in the Brasileirão with his sole goal coming in the Paulista Derby against Corinthians. Unable to find consistent playing time in São Paulo Brenner headed for Rio de Janeiro joining Fluminense on a season-long loan. However his fortunes worsened under manager Fernando Diniz providing zero goals in 230 minutes of football.

Upon his return to the Estádio do Morumbi Brenner reunited with Diniz who had taken charge on September 27 2019 following the dismissal of Cuca. This time however Brenner finally enjoyed a breakthrough season for the Tricolor providing 22 goals in all competitions. São Paulo who in recent years had splurged millions on veteran forwards such as Alexandre Pato and Pablo had finally found their decisive goalscorer.

The then 20-year-old striker led São Paulo to the semifinals of the Copa do Brasil with six goals with his standout performance coming in the first leg of the quarterfinals against Flamengo. Brenner scored a brace at the Maracanã to lead them to victory over the defending Copa Libertadores champions but he was unable to find the back of the net in the following three matches as Grêmio advanced to the Final where they will face Palmeiras.

Brenner was a constant threat in the Brasileirão Série A campaign as well scoring 11 goals and providing three assists in 27 appearances. But just when it seemed as though his performances would lead them to their first league title since 2008 the team’s form fell off a cliff at the turn of the year. São Paulo took two out of a possible 18 points in January leading to Diniz’s dismissal on February 1.

Diniz’s most commonly utilized formation at São Paulo was a 4-4-2 with Brenner partnering Luciano in attack. As seen in the above heat map Brenner often occupied the left side of the pitch combining with Igor Gomes on the left flank. In terms of his movement Brenner utilized his blistering pace to infiltrate the box whether that be receiving a cross from the left back (Reinaldo) or latching onto a through ball from Gabriel Sara or Luciano.

More than just his movement Brenner’s intelligence in positioning himself in advanced areas and creating deadly goalscoring chances can be seen via his Expected Goals tally. Amongst players in the 2020 Brasileirão season he ranks second in xG behind Vasco da Gama’s Germán Cano. His tally of 12.96 puts him ahead of last season’s top goalscorer Flamengo’s Gabriel ‘Gabigol’ Barbosa.

It is worth noting that unlike many in the list Brenner was not his club’s main penalty taker; Reinaldo is. Excluding penalties Brenner averages a non-penalty xG of 0.57 per 90 minutes which puts him in first place amongst all players in the ongoing Brasileirão campaign.

Photo: Twenty3/Wyscout

Brenner is a natural goalscorer who despite being right-footed can finish with either foot. Even at 5’9” the Brazilian is a constant aerial threat in the box with the second-most attempted headers in the league. In the below diagrams we can get an even better idea of his shot distribution and the quality of his chances created with each part of the body.

Photo: Twenty3/Wyscout

A large part of Brenner’s shots come from his intelligence and quickness to move into dangerous areas and confuse the defenders. We can get an even better idea of his incisive movement from São Paulo’s 2-1 victory over Fluminense on December 26.

As Dani Alves and Igor Gomes play a quick one-two Brenner hangs on the edge of the penalty area marked closely by Fluminense right back Danilo Barcelos. Note Brenner’s inclined body stance that allows him to pounce quickly on a potential cross.

When Reinaldo receives the ball in ample space Brenner takes a step back and quickly exploits the space in behind running into the blind-side of Barcelos.

This quick thinking and intelligent positioning allows Brenner to utilize his explosive movement and make contact with the ball at the far post blasting the shot past Marcos Felipe. Whilst ex Seleção striker Fred evened the scoreline after halftime Brenner fired a second goal in the 72nd minute to lead São Paulo to victory against his former club.

Off the ball Brenner is a tactically disciplined striker. One thing that Diniz constantly demanded from his strikers was aggressive pressing and in terms of attempted pressing duels Brenner ranks 7th overall amongst players in the Brasileirão. This restless pressing gives his team a constant threat as seen in the first leg of the Copa do Brasil quarterfinals; goalkeeper Hugo Souza took a heavy touch whilst trying to play out from the back and Brenner capitalized on the mistake and scored the go-ahead goal.

Nevertheless Brenner still needs to improve his decision-making in order to become a roaring success at MLS. He is an impulsive player who struggles to retain possession often keeping his head down and attempting a shot rather than looking up and searching for better passing options. In order to be a better ‘team player’ he must improve in this facet of his game.

Brenner is one of Brazil’s brightest young attacking talents but he isn’t a miracle worker. Last season FC Cincinnati boasted the worst attack in the entire MLS with a total xG of 17.49 and a total of 12 goals scored in 23 MLS matches; the second-worst team Atlanta United scored 23. Gerard Nijkamp knows that the team needs at least three more transfer windows before they are ready to compete and as such he has retained Jaap Stam as manager for the following season.

It has been 31 years since a professional sports franchise in Cincinnati won a national championship and FC Cincinnati are still far away from breaking that duck. However if there’s anybody who can end the string of mediocre performances in southwestern Ohio and build FC Cincinnati into a perennial playoff team it’s Brenner.

Peristiwa yang kedua saat Bung Karno masuk ke dalam masjid dan hendak melakukan proses ijab kabul.

Tiba-tiba penghulu menegur Bung Karno yang mengenal dasi dan mengatakan jika menggunakan dasi bukan kebiasaan orang Islam.

Bung Karno kaget dan membalasnya ""Pak Penghulu saya menyadari bahwa dulunya mempelai hanya memakai pakaian Bumiputera yaitu sarung. Tapi ini adalah cara lama. Aturannya sekarang sudah diperbarui.""

""Ya!"" kata penghulu membentak. ""Tetapi pembaharuan itu hanya untuk memakain pantolan dan jas terbuka.""

""Adalah kegemaran saya untuk berpakaian rapi dan memakain dasi"" tukas Bung Karno.

""Kalau masih terus berkeras kepala untuk berpakaian rapi itu saya menolak untuk melakukan pernikahan."".

Bung Karno bangkit dari kursi dan berkata keras ""Barangkali lebih baik tidak kita melanjutkan pernikahan ini!""

""Persetan tuan-tuan semua. Saya pemberontak dan saya akan selalu memberontak. Saya tidak mau didikte orang di hari pernikahan saya.""

Suasana kemudian terkendali setelah seorang alim ulama berhasil meredakan ketegangan. Pernikahan Bung Karno dan Oetari pun berjalan lancar.

Dunia Bung Karno dan Oetari seperti langit dan bumi. Bung Karno disibukkan dengan aktivitasnya bersama Tjokro dan pendidikannya. Sementara Oetari menikmati masa-masa remajanya.

Pada akhir Juni 1921 Bung Karno berangkat ke Bandung meneruskan pendidikan di Sekolah Tekhnik Tinggi untuk mengejar gelar Insinyur.

Oetari pun iku ke Bandung. Namun hubungan Bung Karno dan Oetari semakin menjauh. Soekarno mengatakan saat ia sedang berpidato di depan kelompok pemuda di malam hari Oetari berkejar-kejaran dengan keponakan perempuan Nyonya Inggit induk semang Bung Karno di Kota Bandung.

""Kami tidur berdampingan di satu ranjang tapi secara jasmaniah kami sebatas kakak dan adik"" kata Soekarno pada Cindy Adams.

Pernikahan Bung Karno dan Oetari berakhir di tahun 1923. Setelah enam bulan tinggal di Bandung Bung Karno kembali ke Surabaya mengantarkan Oetari ke ayahnya Tjokro.

Mereka pun bercerai. Menurut Bung Karno Tjokro meghargai keputusanya bercerai dengan Oetari. Walaupun demikian hubungan Soekarno dan keluarga Tjokro tetap terjalin baik.

This article was published 19/02/2021 (1172 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

A RECENT STUDY has raised more alarm bells about Lake Winnipeg.

The study was conducted by Freshwater Institute Fisheries and Oceans Canada Winnipeg and the Great Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

Since 2002 pelagic forage fish (baitfish) species and early life stages of large-bodied fish species in the pelagic zone in Lake Winnipeg have been monitored. To achieve the objective to study temporal and spatial variations in the offshore fish community in Lake Winnipeg pelagic fish trawls were conducted during spring summer and fall from 2002 to 2019 using the M.V. Namao (operated by the Lake Winnipeg Research Consortium).

Robert Karpiak photo Robyn Grant with a Master Angler cisco caught in Big Whiteshell Lake. Cold-water species including whitefish lake trout and cisco have been providing good angling opportunities.

Here are some of the findings.

Lake Winnipeg has undergone extensive changes in environmental conditions and fish community structure during recent decades. The presence of cyanobacteria and invasive species as well as eutrophication flow regulation fishing pressure and climate change all have potential impacts on the native fish community. Emerald shiner was the most dominant prey fish species but has decreased in the catches since the early 2000s while rainbow smelt have almost entirely disappeared from the catches in recent years.

Overall scientists observed a decrease in four of the six most-caught pelagic species.

This research indicates that forage fish populations in the lake have dropped over 50 per cent since 2002.

There has also been considerable scientific interest to find out whether the freshwater drum of Lake Winnipeg have been consuming zebra mussels. In 2019 the biologists from the Freshwater Fish Institute and the University of Winnipeg examined the stomach contents of drum from different parts of the lake. The overall conclusion was that freshwater drum from Lake Winnipeg feed predominantly on insect larvae not zebra mussels. This is not the case everywhere though. In Lake Erie for example zebra mussels are a big part of their diet.

One interesting fact that came out of the study was size of the fish and the age of the fish. The smallest 2019 fish (age two) was 187 mm and 76 g and the largest (age 57) was 555 mm and 2800 g. It would be interesting to know how old a huge drum from Lake Manitoba would be? The all-time Manitoba record was caught in 2012 on the Whitemud River. It measured 914.40 millimetres or 36 inches. That fish is almost double the size of the 57-year-old drum. Yikes!

Speaking of Lake Winnipeg one question that I often get asked is: can you catch walleye at night on the big lake. The answer yes you can. With the introduction of zebra mussels anglers who fish the lake on a regular basis are amazed by the improved water quality. This is a direct result of the introduction of zebra mussels and their ability to filter algae.

That is a key component if you want to have success in low light. Fish can use their lateral line and sense of smell to find food in turbid water but if you give clarity they will change their feeding habits to maximize any advantage they might have.

For walleye low light conditions give these aggressive predators an advantage over almost all fish species. The large cones and receptors in their eyes allow excellent low-light vision. With a reduction in forage over the last number of years as mentioned earlier in this column walleye use this to their advantage.

With the extreme cold in the province over the last couple of weeks the ice fishing effort has dropped off considerably. Anglers who managed to set up permanent shacks before the cold hit have been able to fish in heated comfort. In fact more and more are spending the money on large portable ones like the Ice Castle and Yeti just to name two of the largest manufactures. These units supply all the comforts of home including a kitchen bathroom and television.

For those who have been able to get out the cold-water species like lake whitefish lake trout and cisco have been providing some good angling opportunities. Friend Robyn Grant and her partner Robert Karpiak spent last weekend at Big Whiteshell Lake. They were rewarded with several master-angler fish.

Clear Lake whitefish are still biting with a few big pike thrown in the mix. Crappie fishing has slowed in the Whiteshell but a few fish are still being caught.

It was around 9 a.m. on Aug. 12 when Arokia Raj first realized that something had gone terribly wrong.

Raj a member of a Citigroup team that processes and services asset-based loans was reviewing the previous day's transactions when he noticed large gaps in the numbers — a discrepancy of just under $900 million.

Raj quickly put two and two together: The figure matched down to the decimal point the outstanding principal balance on a loan that the beauty company Revlon had taken out nearly five years ago.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

With a few fatal clicks Raj had mistakenly sent Revlon's lenders not just the accrued interest of less than $8 million as intended but also the total outstanding principal.

Those clicks started a cascade of events that began with Citigroup mistakenly wiring $900 million to a group of asset managers who had floated money to Revlon wound through various court battles as Citigroup tried to recover the money and ended Tuesday with a decision that shook the foundations of Wall Street.

Judge Jesse Furman of New York said the lenders could keep the $500 million that hadn't been repaid to Citibank. The bank has recovered the remaining $400 million.

Insider took a look at the 101-page decision to lay out exactly how as Judge Furman called it one of the ""biggest blunders in banking history"" — and its $500 million price tag — unfolded.

Revlon's loan

Citigroup has long struggled against technology. Its systems are a patchwork built up over dozens of mergers that never got knitted together.

One of the largest government bailouts in the financial crisis went to Citigroup thanks to an ill-timed push into mortgage securities and an inability to see all of the firm's exposures at once. The tech would also prove key in Michael Corbat's decision to retire as CEO of Citigroup last year after regulators grew tired with his inability to fix risk compliance and technology systems Insider has previously reported.

This particular story begins in 2016 when Revlon the cosmetics darling of drugstores took out a seven-year $1.8 billion loan from a group of lenders after it bought the beauty company Elizabeth Arden for $870 million earlier that year. Revlon tapped Citibank as its administrative agent charged with distributing interest payments and performing back-office services on its behalf.

In the spring of 2020 Revlon facing a liquidity squeeze sought to undergo a restructuring and raise another $800 million-plus in debt financing. Revlon's creditors however saw the move as an effort to ""siphon away"" the collateral for their loans. They sued the cosmetics company and asked Citibank to resign its duty alleging that it was helping Revlon with a controversial debt restructuring.

Citibank's 'six-eye' failure

On August 11 Citibank prepared to send interest payments to Revlon's creditors. The lenders weren't expecting these payments which fell outside of the usual repayment schedule and were being sent as a result of some lenders making changes in their positions from the 2016 loan.

At around 4 p.m. Citibank's Asset-Based Transitional Finance (ABTF) team was instructed to ""pay the Principal to the Wash Account when accrued interest is processed."" A wash account is also known as a clearing account and is where Citi temporarily holds money during transfers to ensure it doesn't leave the bank.

Approximately an hour later the ABTF team which processes and services Citibank's asset-based loans was given the green light to send out the interest payments to the lenders.

According to testimony from Raj the employee who would later discover the discrepancies whenever the ABTF team processes this type of transaction it must create an interest schedule draft invoices for the lenders and input payment instructions in Flexcube the software Citibank uses for to execute wire payments.

Transactions are also subject to Citibank's ""six-eye"" approval procedure: three people must review and approve the transaction before execution.

The first person that day called the ""maker"" was Santhosh Kuppusamy Ravi who inputted the payment information into Flexcube. Ravi checked off the ""PRINCIPAL"" box on Flexcube believing that this would send the principal to the wash account.

Raj was the second pair of eyes as the ""checker"" reviewing and verifying the information before the ""approver"" in this case Vincent ""Vinny"" Fratta the head of the ABTF group made a final check.

What all three people didn't realize however was that they'd needed to check off two other boxes on Flexcube: the ""FRONT"" and ""FUND"" as delineated in Citibank's manual. Otherwise the total amount — including the principal — would automatically be released as wire payments.

By 6 p.m. that evening the money was out the door.

Discovering the error

The next morning on August 12 Raj was reviewing the previous day's transactions when he discovered that a total of more than $900 million — not the roughly $8 million of intended interest payments — had been sent to the lenders.

After Raj alerted the team lead Fratta opened up Skype and broke the news to his supervisor Vincent Farrell the head of Citi's North American loan operations.

""Bad news"" Fratta wrote. ""Principal to wash wires look like they went out the door.""

He followed up a few minutes later. ""Yup confirmed. Principal out the door when it was supposed to be sent to wash for Revlon restructure.""

Advertisement

Fratta still not realizing that human error had brought this about thought that there was a software error. He emailed Citibank's tech support group: ""Flexcube is not working properly and it will send your payments out the door to lenders/borrowers.""

Over the course of the day the truth of what had really happened finally dawned on them.

At 2:25 p.m. Citibank began sending recall notices to the lenders. It sent a second set at 6 p.m. a third set the next day and several more thereafter.

'Could this be a mistake?'

Revlon's lenders outsource the job of managing the funds and overall portfolio to asset managers. Those asset managers including Allstate HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management among others weren't expecting the payment and they were perplexed when they first saw the unexpected — and huge — payments from Citibank on the mornings of August 12 and 13.

Advertisement

""So strange — could this be a mistake?"" an Allstate portfolio manager asked her colleague when she was notified of the payment. ""Not sure if this is in error seems very unlikely.""

A Bardin Hill partner and portfolio manager testified that the thought of an established institution like Citibank making such a huge blunder ""literally never crossed my mind. I still find it kind of mind-blowing in general.""

The news quickly spread among the asset managers' employees. ""How was work today honey? It was ok except I accidentally sent $900mm out to people who weren't supposed to have it"" quipped an HPS employee in a Bloomberg chat to a coworker. ""Downside of work from home. Maybe the dog hit the keyboard.""

""The song 'Had a Bad Day' playing [in] the background"" their coworker replied.

Everyone it seemed was wondering the same thing: How exactly had Citibank made such a massive ""mind-blowing"" mistake?

'Do not return any funds'

Despite the notices the lenders' asset managers instructed their clients to hold onto the funds they'd received.

""Revlon full paydown?"" a bank debt manager at Brigade Capital wrote to its general counsel.

In instances where they had returned some of the money the asset managers quickly directed their analysts to ""claw back"" the funds.

Advertisement

""PLEASE DO NOT RETURN ANY FUNDS RELATED TO REVLON"" an analyst at Greywolf Loan Management emphasized in an email.

That stance kicked off a fierce legal battle as well as one that played out in the rough and tumble world of Wall Street trading. In September managers at the bank instructed sales and trading staff to essentially freeze out the funds from services they rely on to make investment decisions and bundle new bonds Insider previously reported.

Employees were told to stop sending pricing information on bonds — known on Wall Street as ""runs"" — and remove those clients from any distribution lists they may have been on. In some cases salespeople and traders ignored Bloomberg chat messages or refused to return calls from those clients. Desk research pricing data and other market-based color can often translate into the edge funds need in the hand-to-hand combat of distressed debt trading.

And yet the asset managers had reason to believe their clients were repaid the outstanding balance in full albeit unexpectedly. After all they'd been wired the exact amount they were owed.

They also couldn't fathom that Citibank — a veritable Wall Street institution — could have made such a huge gaffe.

It was on these grounds that several months later during a December bench trial conducted over Zoom lawyers defending the asset managers argued that they were not obligated to return the money.

""Faced with these circumstances [the lenders] believed and were justified in believing that the payments were intentional"" wrote Judge Furman in his conclusion. ""Indeed to believe otherwise — to believe that Citibank one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world had made a mistake that had never happened before to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational.""

Overall momentum for climate action was increasing before the world was hit by COVID-19. Despite the financial hardships brought about by the pandemic government focus on climate action is actually accelerating with stronger climate policies and net zero emissions targets being put in place. This increased focus on climate is occurring in parallel with a rise in corporate and individual focus. The combination we believe puts us at a tipping point on climate action.



In order to decarbonize the world a whole portfolio of mitigation needs to be developed and implemented across the highest carbon-emitting sectors. Although the pace of innovation has accelerated and investment has increased the investment gap between what's being spent currently and what needs to be spent is huge— as much as $3-$5+ trillion per year.



Capital is needed to fund the technologies required help markets evolve towards decarbonization. Advancements in battery technology the hydrogen economy carbon capture and storage electrification and efficiency require investment to become reality. Carbon management (i.e. carbon dioxide removal) and carbon pricing will help to align investment and economic activity with climate goals.



Public sector spending is crucial to funding climate action together with private investment. Luckily green momentum in the investor community has led to an explosion in assets under management incorporating ESG considerations. At over $30 trillion the challenge is putting these assets to work. Developing a clear green framework will help deploy ESG assets where they are most needed.



Financial innovation is the key to matching capital supply and demand. Instruments including project finance green social and sustainability (GSS) bonds SPACs 'efficiency as a service' and green securitization are used to close the gap.



Given the scale of the issue we've published Financing a Greener Planet in two volumes. Volume I — Catalyzing Private Capital for a Net Zero Emissions World — focuses on the three factors which indicate we are at a tipping point on climate action — policy and regulation innovation and green momentum in the investor community. Volume II — Bridging the Gap between Green Investment and Investors — is dedicated to the financial options available to close the massive climate investment gap.

What’s Up? (Feb. 14-20)

A Costly Mix-up

Citigroup made an embarrassing mistake last summer and accidentally wired $900 million to a group of lenders instead of a much smaller interest payment it intended to send. Citigroup has been trying to reclaim the money which it sent on behalf of the beauty company Revlon ever since. And typically recipients of cash wired in error are required to return it. But last week a judge ruled that the lenders could keep it all. His reasoning: They had grounds to believe that the payment which covered all that Revlon owed was intentional. The decision is a major blow to Citigroup which says it will appeal.

That was the question posed by members of Congress when they grilled key players in the GameStop trading frenzy that hijacked the stock market last month and caused many investors both large and small to lose pots of money. At the center of the hearing was Vlad Tenev the chief executive of the online brokerage firm Robinhood which handled most of the GameStop trades but suddenly halted them when they reached a fever pitch on Jan. 28. Mr. Tenev explained — again — that the GameStop trades were stopped because of new requirements from the clearinghouses that perform them. He apologized to his users for the company’s failings but he also insisted that Robinhood had done nothing wrong and did not privilege powerful business partners at the expense of small-time investors as some critics have suggested. It’s unclear what — if anything — lawmakers and regulators will do to curtail turmoil like this in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tb25leS9iaWctdGVjaC1lbXBsb3llZXMtb3BlbmVkLXdhbGxldHMtZm9yLWJpZGVuLWNhbXBhaWdu0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21vbmV5L2JpZy10ZWNoLWVtcGxveWVlcy1vcGVuZWQtd2FsbGV0cy1mb3ItYmlkZW4tY2FtcGFpZ24uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big tech employees opened wallets for Biden campaign,"WASHINGTON -- Employees of big technology firms were a key source of contributions for Joe Biden's presidential campaign newly released campaign finance records show eclipsing donations from employees at traditional Democratic fundraising sources such as banks and law firms.

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

PARLER INTERIM CEO SAYS TRUMP BIDEN WELCOME ON PLATFORM

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

GOOGLE TO EVALUATE EXECUTIVES ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Mr. Biden has signaled that he supports rescinding the broad legal immunity that tech firms currently enjoy for information carried over their networks.

As the Biden administration settles in tech companies are awaiting key picks for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division head. The appointments could determine how aggressively the government handles existing investigations or bringing about new ones advisers to the companies said.

The Journal's analysis is based on the latest Federal Election Commission data covering the 2020 election cycle for Mr. Biden's campaign two joint fundraising committees and individual donations to those committees made through the online donation platform ActBlue. The Journal examined campaign-finance data to compile a list of companies whose employees donated the most money.

The analysis relied on a standardized version of the self-reported employer information on each donation and should be treated as an estimate because some of the public records are incomplete or flawed.

FACEBOOK TO EXPAND EFFORT TO COMBAT CLIMATE MISINFORMATION LABEL POSTS

Because online donation platforms that itemize even the smallest contribution weren't as widely used in 2016 and 2012 data for previous years include information only on donors who gave more than $200 to a campaign.

About two-thirds of the money in presidential races is donated to candidates from individuals who could give up to $2800 to a candidate for the recent election. Those who donate $200 or more are required to disclose the names of their employers.

While corporations are prohibited from making financial donations to candidates for national office many companies operate political-action committees or PACs which are employee-funded accounts that companies use to donate money to favored candidates. Relatively little money in presidential elections comes from corporate PACs. Labor unions spend millions of dollars each election to support Democratic candidates.

Technology employees made donations to other political entities that worked to elect Mr. Biden and other Democrats including Future Forward USA PAC which spent millions of dollars on the 2020 election.

Mr. Biden's campaign according to the Journal's analysis received $3.7 million from employees of five of the largest Wall Street firms: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. Bank of America Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. In prior elections those firms ranked among the top sources of money for the Democratic presidential candidate records show.

That was less than the total contributed to Mr. Biden by employees of Alphabet who donated $5.3 million making the tech company the No. 1 source of money the Journal analysis shows.

Google employees were the top source of donations to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign and the second-largest source of money for Mr. Obama's 2012 race.

Employees of Amazon contributed a total of $2.8 million to Mr. Biden's campaign. Amazon was the third-largest source of money among companies to Mr. Biden in the election. The company hadn't been a big source of campaign money for prior Democratic candidates records show.

Microsoft employees have long been a top source of money for Democratic presidential candidates. Microsoft employees donated $3.2 million to Mr. Biden in the election.

Facebook employees have emerged as a top source of money donating $1.9 million to his campaign records show.

Other top sources of money for Mr. Biden were employees of Lowercase Capital Oracle Corp. Netflix Inc. Saban Capital Group and Morgan & Morgan the data analyzed by the Journal shows. Lowercase Capital is a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in Twitter Uber Technologies Inc. and Instagram now part of Facebook.

Gen Z VCs

From Margaux MacColl:

Gen Z venture capitalists have made headlines by starting syndicates networking in Slack groups and making a racket on Clubhouse. It has quickly become clear: Gen Z is already shaking up the venture-capital industry.

There's no set path for Gen Z people born between 1995 and 2010 to break into venture. Some landed their first jobs by getting lucky with a cold email while others got the attention of bigwigs through ambitious personal projects. For example one Gen Zer on our list landed his venture-capital job after writing a book at age 18 that impressed a venture-firm partner. Others are forgoing traditional firms entirely opting instead to angel invest in startups led by Gen Z founders that they believe in.

But there are some commonalities between the rising stars on this list: Almost everyone leverages social media in some way (see: the three TikTok superstars) many deeply understand the importance of forming their own Gen Z venture-capital communities and pretty much all of them want to change the world.

Citi's $900 million blunder

It was around 9 a.m. on Aug. 12 when Arokia Raj first realized that something had gone terribly wrong.

Raj a member of a Citigroup team that processes and services asset-based loans was reviewing the previous day's transactions when he noticed large gaps in the numbers — a discrepancy of just under $900 million.

Raj quickly put two and two together: The figure matched down to the decimal point the outstanding principal balance on a loan that the beauty company Revlon had taken out nearly five years ago.

With a few fatal clicks Raj had mistakenly sent Revlon's lenders not just the accrued interest of less than $8 million as intended but also the total outstanding principal.

Walmart's healthcare slowdown

Walmart is already rolling back its bold clinic strategy. Walmart Health

From Shelby Livingston and Blake Dodge:

Walmart's ambitious plan to build thousands of low-cost health clinics across the country is slowing down less than two years after the retail giant embarked on a big push to expand access to primary care.

Walmart launched its first comprehensive health center in September 2019. The one-stop-shop clinics were an attempt to leapfrog the competition and capture a piece of the $3.8 trillion industry while sending more people into Walmart stores.

Walmart's vision was to become ""America's neighborhood health destination."" The push deeper into healthcare came as competitors like Amazon and CVS Health also bulked up their healthcare ambitions.

Now Walmart's clinic strategy is in flux Insider has learned from conversations with eight current and former employees most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak with the press because of confidentiality agreements. Their identities are known to Insider.

The most concrete sign of the slowdown is that the company isn't on track to meet its earlier projections for the number of clinics it wants to build this year according to documents obtained by Insider.

ICYMI: What became of Gaia

Bettmann/Contributor; Samantha Lee/Insider

From Rob Price:

Only a select group of employees were allowed to know about the corpse.

It had surfaced in the valleys of southern Peru and word quickly made its way to Jirka Rysavy a former athlete from Czechoslovakia turned serial entrepreneur. Rysavy now operating a young video-streaming service called Gaia got to work dispatching a video crew from the company's crystal-strewn headquarters in the shadows of Colorado's Rocky Mountains to document the find. The team was sworn to silence hiding its mission even from coworkers.

The body looked at first glance almost human. But the mummified cadaver had just three disturbingly long fingers on each hand. Each foot bore a trio of freakishly long toes. Its eyes were unnatural alien slits.

MAZI Okechukwu Unegbu

MAZI Okechukwu Unegbu lawyer arbitrator and stockbroker is currently Managing Director/Chief Executive Maxifund Investments and Securities Plc. Unegbu who boasts of over 30 years career in banking and finance has worked in prominent financial institutions including First Bank defunct African Merchant Bank Progress Bank (rose to become Chairman/Chief Executive) Broad Bank and Citizens Bank (as Chief Executive in 2005) and equally served as former president/chairman of the Council of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN). In this interview with IBRAHIM APEKHADE YUSUF the Imo state-born technocrat fondly called OCKU and who turns 70 in August shares his experience managing men and resources. Excerpts:

When does your typical day begin?

For me my typical day starts at 5.am in the morning. Once I’m up from bed I say my prayers and take my morning exercise for about 45minutes and thereafter start getting ready to go out by 7-7:30am. By 8:30am I start attending to my clients. I follow this regimen every day except on Saturdays because I sleep a bit late at past midnight to 1:00am and I wake up at 7:30am. On weekends I spend one hour for my morning exercise.

What’s your management philosophy?

My management philosophy is what I call a combination of ideas. I like to engage people to do the job. I allow them to come up with their own ideas because some of these young chaps are smart people really. What I do is to use people around me to achieve results. The best you can do as a good manager is to leave the space open in such a way that there is freedom for everyone to operate and achieve their potentials.

What’s your management style?

Just like my management philosophy I allow people to make their own inputs into any decision to be taken. What I do most times is that if I have an idea about any matter I just throw it open to the floor for people to make their suggestions and then I will sum up what they have done and take final decision.

Do you delegate responsibility or you micromanage?

Yes indeed I delegate. I don’t micromanage at all. I delegate a lot. Like I mentioned earlier my own idea of management is that once you give people the right tools to work with they can actually excel. That’s one thing I have seen in managing people.

How do you motivate your staff?

There is often a misconception out there that the only way to motivate people is by giving them salaries and bonuses alone. No that certainly is not true to a large extent. Fine you can pay them fat cheques and salaries but there are far better ways to motivate your staff. In my own case I give my staff the opportunity to excel in their chosen careers through creating the enabling environment and opportunities for growth.

How do you reprimand your staff? Do you apply the stick?

For me the best you can do is to allow room for mistakes to be made so that they can learn from it. My own attitude is that if you get angry at your staff for making a mistake next time they may as well sit down and do nothing. That way you have ended up creating zombies. However if someone makes mistakes consistently move such a person to another section and have him or her watched closely instead of asking that person to go outright. If you just fire such a person that would be tantamount to throwing away the baby with the bathe water. It’s not the right thing to do. Once you move the person to another department you have already sent a signal to that person and most times such people usually have something to prove about their competence. Most times they excel in their new role. As a manager with over three decades experience that is what I have seen in management across different cadres. Even as a lawyer I have applied the same methods and it has worked for me as well. Currently as a member of the Executive Council of the Nigerian Bar Association I can also testify that this method has worked for me.

What motivates you?

Motivation for me on a personal note is working with people. I like going out of my way to help people solve their problems. I tend to derive personal satisfaction in that. For me the moment I can ensure that the next person to me or even someone I don’t know is able to achieve something through my efforts that gives me a level of indescribable joy.

What is the best decision you have taken?

I remember quite a few of them. I remember I took a decision to take Citizen Bank to the capital make at the time. I was able to negotiate everything and it went well. That to me was one of the best decisions I ever took as the CEO at the time. I also remember some of the roles and actions I took in ensuring that majority of my staff then were better place career-wise by taking them under my wings. Today thankfully I have many of my staff who are excelling in the banking sector and they still try to remind me of the part I played in building their careers. Such recollection is a thing of joy to me.

What’s the worst decision you have taken?

I remember as CEO how the action I took cost investors their money after we invested the funds in a bad business and we lost billions of naira as a result. It is one sad episode of my career I usually do not like to recall ever.

What are your other areas of interest besides business?

I love reading a lot. I play lawn tennis as well as table tennis. I also do photography too. I have all kinds of camera. Photography is one pastime I love so much. I just love taking shots of memory events around me. These days with a mobile phone this is even a lot easier.

What’s your choice holiday destination?

I also travel a lot both within and outside the country most times. I can say for a fact that I have been to nearly every part of Nigeria today. But these days travelling within the country is not safe as it used to be because of the problem of insecurity everywhere now. These days if I travel I go by air and am conscious of myself wherever I go. I have been to Iseyin Shaki after Oyo state to see how local people live. In my state in Imo I have travelled round all the 24 local government areas as well. When I travelled round I was able to appreciate each of the peculiar needs and challenges of these people and that sort of gave me a lot of ideas when I decided to go into the governorship race of Imo state few years later. I have also been to the UK and the USA too many times. Such trips abroad usually afford me the opportunity to learn new things and new trends that I can apply to my career and life in general. So travelling is more than an adventure for me.

Do you read?

Sure I do read a lot. I try as much as possible to read a book every month.

What was the last book you read and when?

Yes I had to read the book by Chinua Achebe Things Fall Apart. I also read management books as a matter of routine. What I do is I just get the books of leading management authors and I read them up for ideas. I’m also now following every bit about digital currency. I packed myself in it. The whole world is now using digital currency. That is why I’m amazed that the CBN had to place a ban on crypto currency. From what I have found out through digital currency a lot of youths who hitherto were idle and jobless are now fully engaged. The world has gone digital but it seems the apex bank is not yet in tune with such global development.

What’s your favourite Nigerian meal?

I don’t like egusi or rice at all. I like my eba with ogbono. I like amala with gbegiri and ewedu soup. I also like iyan or what is generally called pounded yam. I enjoy local foods a lot.

Do you cook?

Oh yes I do. My mother had all four us boys there was no girl in our midst so she taught us all how to cook. But I have reduced my activities in the kitchen because I have a dutiful wife who is ever ready to do the cooking for me.

So you do the dishes as well?

Oh sure I do sometimes. I also do a lot of household chores too in order to relief my wife of stress. If there is nobody in the house and I happen to go to the kitchen and see the place unkempt I take it upon myself to clean up the place. I think my wife appreciates that a lot.

How do you unwind?

I’m an outdoor person alright. I like to go to the club Ikoyi Club to be precise where I’m a life member now. At the club I play lawn tennis table tennis. I meet with my friends to network socialise generally and relief stress. I also try to encourage my family to join me at the club too because it is such a place you can feel relax over a cup of tea or coffee. My wife is not the outgoing type but I try to encourage her to get out of the house once in a while. You see when you go out of the house; you’re refreshed and renewed in so many ways. I have followed that regimen for many years and I know it’s beneficial to me.

You’re turning 70 years in a few months. How did your upbringing impacted who you’re today?

My father was a customary court judge and was also into farming trading and he made sure he excelled in all these areas as well. For me that background sort of prepared me for life. I was a war commander during the Biafra war. I was just 17 years old then. During the war a lot happened. I remember during the war lizards and rats were the choice delicacies then. In fact if you kill lizards or rats you made hot steaming pepper soup with it. It was so funny that you could also get sanctioned if you didn’t tell your superiors you were preparing such pepper soup. That is one nasty experience that has stayed with me. I can’t seem to obliterate it from my memory. I’m already compiling this experience and memories of the war in my memoir due for launch at my forthcoming 70th birthday in August 17th to be precise. I remember when I visited former president Olusegun Obasanjo at his Ota Farms when I was his Relationship Manager at the First Bank. He told me are you not afraid coming to see a General. I told him I was not afraid that as his Relationship Manager I was even more powerful than he is because it is whatever I tell him that he would do. Then I said even as a War Commander in the Biafra Army if I came across him during the war I would have shot at him. He said “yeeparipa!”

I also remembered when I visited OBJ at the Aso Villa in Abuja as President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers with other executives. When we got there Baba said he was president with a big P while I was president with a small P. He also said bankers are thieves. He said so many times. But I never responded to him. So I told him Baba I want to tell you a story. He said ok go ahead. I said my father was a customary court judge. Anytime he came home he would gather us all his children and say ‘please don’t misbehave outside because if you do they will say you lack home training.’ When I said that Baba OBJ looked at me and said ‘so you’re calling me the head of thieves ba?” (laughs). I have been friends with OBJ for some time now.",,,,,,

The Supreme Court has cleared the project for a state-of-the-art waste-to-energy plant in Agra — a first for a city in Uttar Pradesh — which was pending for four years.According to Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials the advanced municipal solid waste (MSW) processing plant will be built at the Kuberpur landfill site within the next 14 months.It will also produce at least 10MW electricity by processing 500 metric tonnes of solid waste.A huge amount of legacy waste (about 6 lakh tones as per AMC records) has accumulated over a period of time at the landfill site besides the 700-750 tonnes of mixed MSW that is dumped at the landfill site every day.Agra Mayor Naveen Jain said “Spaak Bresson Private Limited will be setting up a technologically advanced plant at Kuberpur landfill site to extract electric energy out of the MSW. The plant is expected to take 14 months to be erected.Initially it will produce at least 10MW of electricity every day.” He added “The waste-to-energy technology is especially important for the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone. Not only will it strengthen the city’s solid waste management but also check air pollution caused by burning of waste.”Additional municipal commissioner K B Singh said “The technology that Spaak Bresson will adopt for the Agra plant is the same as the Zevo Malescie plant in Prague. It will ensure long-term sustainable solution for the disposal of solid waste while emissions will meet all regulatory norms and flue gases will be cleaner. The entire plant will be automated and will achieve high efficiency level.”In October 2017 a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) was signed in Lucknow between Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) and Spark Bresson a Czech company under which UPPCL agreed to purchase electricity produced at the waste-to-energy plant it would set up in Agra.AMC executive engineer (environment) Rajiv Rathi said “As per plan AMC will have to provide at least 500 metric tonnes of solid waste to the concessionaire every day from which it will produce 10MW of electricity. The amount of electricity produced will increase with rise in quantity of MSW supplied. The electricity produced out of the waste will be transmitted to a local substation. From there it will be supplied to the power grid and then further distributed.”Explaining the mechanism Rathi said “The process of conversion of waste into energy involves combustion of solid waste at high temperature. Mud and stones mixed with waste will not create any problem. Only single-use polythene metal and some other substances need to be segregated. The company has automatic machines to do the task. Emission of gases in the entire process will meet international standards.”,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are as many as 2000 paper bottles that are on trial at this time and will be on trial through the summer months. These bottles are made of sustainably sourced wood with a bio-based material barrier that is capable of preventing the release of gas as well as liquids and oxygen. The bottle has been made by Danish company Paboco or The Paper Bottle Company and co-developed by Coca-Cola’s research team. This comes at a time when the company has announced new sustainability targets leading up to the year 2030 and is focusing more on the environment.

The company insists though that this technology which they call a breakthrough is still very much in development. As part of the trial 2000 paper bottles of the plant-based beverage AdeZ will be sold via online grocery store Kifli.hu to understand the performance of the packaging and also the customer response. Paboco the Danish startup is supported by ALPLA and BillerudKorsnäs in cooperation with Carlsberg L’Oréal and The Absolut Company. This initiative comes as the Coca-Cola Company was under pressure to create an environmentally sustainable packaging system for the beverages they sell. In a recent report released by charity group Break Free From Plastic Coca-Cola was ranked as the world’s number one plastic polluter followed by rival Pepsi and Nestle.

The trial of the paper bottles is part of the Coca-Cola Company’s World Without Waste sustainable packaging goal to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every bottle the company sells by the year 2030. At the same time the company has to substantially reduce the use of virgin packaging materials and use only 100% recyclable packaging materials. “People expect Coca‑Cola to develop and bring to market new innovative and sustainable types of packaging. That’s why we are partnering with experts like Paboco experimenting openly and conducting this first in-market trial” says Daniela Zahariea director of technical supply chain and innovation Coca‑Cola Europe.

Coca-Cola isn’t the only company testing paper bottles. Vodka maker Absolut is also due to trial paper bottles for its carbonated raspberry drink product in the UK and Sweden. The trick for these bottles to work would the robustness that a single material molding can provide and not have any joints in the packaging to prevent leakage from the pressure that carbonated drinks generate inside the bottle packaging. Since paper shouldn’t come in contact with the drinks inside the innards of these paper bottles will be layered with a sustainable coating derived from plants.

Welcome to The Daily Stupid where we cover some of the dumbest and most idiotic things happening around the world and on the internet.

Today we’ve got more stupid including Madonna Marina Sirtis an attack on Wonder Woman and Coca-Cola.

Let’s get to it.

1. Madonna Attacks The Patriarchy

Pop superstar Madonna took to Twitter to attack The Patriarchy.

The singer wrote “The Patriarchy continues to crush my neck with their heavy boots cut off my life force and take away my voice-Even those who call themselves artists………….You know who you are!!! DEATH TO THE PATRIARCHY! Now and Forever. #riskwhatyouvalue #valuewhatyourisk.”

She did all of this while posting a photo of her wearing a crown and what appears to be a diamond studded necklace and what are more than likely extremely expensive earrings.

You are not oppressed the patriarchy isn’t trying to silence you as evidenced by this tweet and there aren’t any heavy boots on your neck. You are one of the richest people on the planet with an estimated net worth of $850 million.

As La Reina Creole puts it “Oh that’s cute. You think you’re oppressed. Girl Bye.”

Madonna Welcome To The Daily Stupid.

2. Wonder Woman Attacked For Having Feels For Superman

Twitter user MattChaser233 decided to go after Immortal Wonder Woman writer Becky Cloonan for the way she wrote Wonder Woman and Superman’s relationship in the Immortal Wonder Woman #2.

MattChaser233 went after Cloonan on Twitter in a thread where Cloonan was discussing how she was staying warm during the recent winter storms.

The user wrote “Hello writer. I read your Immortal Wonder Woman & I am not happy with your possible hint at Wonder Woman’s ‘feelings’ for Superman. If you establish that relationship and ignore other partners like New 52 winter storms won’t be your worry. We’ll destroy you & your comics.”

This might be a little more than just plain stupidity. A better term might be hateful lunacy.

As for the cause of this in Cloonan Immortal Wonder Woman #2 Wonder Woman recounts how she loved Superman after he sacrificed himself to save Earth by driving Darkseid into a dying sun.

As you can see Diana states “I loved him all the more for it.”

This isn’t out of the ordinary for Sueprman and Wonder Woman. The two are great friends. And in the past they’ve actually been lovers. In fact in the New 52 there was a series called Superman/Wonder Woman that explored their romantic relationship!

Twitter user MattChaser233 welcome to The Daily Stupid!

3. Marina Sirtis

This one takes the cake for today. Star Trek actor Marina Sirtis went on Twitter where she typed out “Don’t get me wrong my heart bleeds for what Texans are going through right now but the mean girl in me says you get the government you deserve and they have voted Republican across the board for the last 20 years.”

To make matters worse Sirtis would later tweet “I reread my tweet to make sure I didn’t say the Texans deserve to die.”

This is just monumentally stupid.

Welcome to The Daily Stupid Marina Sirtis. I’m sure it won’t be the last time.

4. Coca-Cola Promotes Racism

Alleged leaked training documents from Coca-Cola revealed the company is promoting racism to its employees. The documents are part of Robin DiAngelo’s course called “Confront Racism With Robin DiAngelo.”

The documents tell employees to “Try To Be Less White.”

It then explains that in order to do that you must “be less oppressive be less arrogant be less certain be less defensive be less ignorant be more humble listen believe break with apathy break with white solidarity.”

Coca-Cola welcome to The Daily Stupid. Racism is wrong. You promoting is not only stupid but most definitely wrong.

This has been your Daily Stupid. If you have suggestions for tomorrow leave a comment or hit us up on social media."

In February 2021 a meme circulated on Facebook claiming that ""Communist China"" owned DreamWorks:

Since the meme urged people to ""FACT CHECK THIS!"" we did and it appears that these claims are made up out of whole cloth.

DreamWorks Animation LLC is an American animation studio best known for making movies such as ""Shrek"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon."" It started as a division of the movie production company DreamWorks Pictures founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. In 2016 the company was acquired by NBCUniversal a division of Comcast Corporation in a deal worth about $3.8 billion.

Variety reported at the time:

NBCUniversal has set a deal to buy DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion in cash giving the Comcast-owned media conglomerate added heft in its effort to compete with rivals like Disney Time Warner and Viacom all of which cater more directly to kid-and family audiences. [...] ""DreamWorks will help us grow our film television theme parks and consumer products businesses for years to come” said NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke. ” We are fortunate to have Illumination founder Chris Meledandri to help guide the growth of the DreamWorks Animation business in the future.”

NBCUniversal and Comcast are both American companies.

We're not entirely sure where the claim that ""China owns DreamWorks"" originated but it might be based on some confusion over the animation company Pearl Studios which was formerly known as Oriental DreamWorks. While these companies do have a connection they are two separate entities. Oriental DreamWorks was started as a joint Chinese-American venture in 2012 between Chinese investment companies and DreamWorks Animation. When Comcast acquired DreamWorks in 2016 they noted that DreamWorks Animation owned a 45% stake in Oriental Dreamworks:

DWA is also the majority owner of AwesomenessTV a leading video destination for Generation Z and Millennial audiences and also owns 45% of Oriental DreamWorks a world-class animation studio in China that produces family entertainment for both Chinese and global audiences.

Two years after this deal in 2018 the Chinese investment firm CMC Capital Partners took full ownership of Oriental DreamWorks and relaunched it as Pearl Studio. Deadline reported:

A consortium led by Li Ruigang’s CMC Capital Partners has taken full ownership of Shanghai-based animation studio Oriental DreamWorks relaunching it as Pearl Studio. Universal which inherited 45% of the joint venture when parent Comcast acquired DreamWorks Animation in 2016 had been looking to offload its interests. Financial terms were not disclosed. The newly-christened studio will be led by CEO Frank Zhu and Chief Creative Officer Peilin Chou. The senior executive team also includes Head of Studio Dagan Potter Head of Ancillary Business PC Xu and Head of Operation Cindy Zhou. Oriental DreamWorks which launched in 2012 is the studio behind Kung Fu Panda 3 which was the first official U.S.-China animated co-production and one of the highest-grossing animated films ever when it released in the Middle Kingdom in 2016. In September last year the studio unveiled a slate of key development projects.

A Chinese investment firm (not the Chinese government) owns an animation studio called Pearl Studio that originated as a Chinese-American joint venture called Oriental DreamWorks. In no way can this be construed as the Chinese Communist Party's owning the American company DreamWorks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWRpbmdlYWdsZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9uZXdzbWFrZXJzLWZvci1mZWJydWFyeS0yMS_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWFkaW5nZWFnbGUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjAvbmV3c21ha2Vycy1mb3ItZmVicnVhcnktMjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newsmakers for February 21,"For information on submitting an obituary please contact Reading Eagle by phone at 610-371-5018 or email at obituaries@readingeagle.com or fax at 610-371-5193.

The concept which won an honorable mention in the SKYHIVE Skyscraper Challenge was designed to span an entire block in Center City to the northwest of the Comcast Technology Center. According to the architects the 1.9-million-square-foot plan would use 2075125 cubic feet of wood products “easily replenished by North American forests in less than three hours” and sequester 80775 US tons of carbon dioxide within the structure resulting in emissions savings are the equivalent those produced by 12073 cars within one year.

Rather than an actual proposal Timber Towers is a concept meant to showcase an innovative type of construction. Unlike virtually all high-rises built up to now which have a steel concrete or a composite structure the buildings would use cross-laminated timber technology to create structures composed of thick lumber members. The beams and the floors would also be made completely out of wood while the glass exterior would feature glass thick lumber cross-bracing.

The plan would include 1300871 square feet of office space 102642 square feet of condo/co-working space 78930 square feet of educational space 31330 square feet of office amenity space and 29188 square feet of retail. The residential tower would house 289 rental units.

The tallest tower appears to be in the 800-foot range. If built the project would have an incredible impact both on the skyline and on the construction market. And though the towers would awkwardly block the Comcast Technology Center from view when seen from the Philadelphia Museum of Art and would arguably throw off the appearance of the skyline from certain view corridors the buildings step up toward the skyline core as a pleasant gesture that builds up to the skyline’s massing.

No completion date is available as the design is a purely hypothetical project that as far as we know is not considered for actual construction.

Since that time there were a few additional changes so here is the updated post. Do note that this post is mostly cheap recycled content.

Since I was a youth I have been interested in learning what numbers new Blue Jays players were going to wear in Toronto and to spot which current Jays were switching numbers. Because of the lack of Internet access back then I started a notebook tracking player numbers when I was 9 or so and my favourite present every birthday (it’s in April so make a note readers) would be my own copy of the Blue Jays Official Guide which listed the numbers for everyone including non-roster invitees.

Looking up player numbers is much easier nowadays but I still find it fun to keep track on who is wearing what from year to year. Let’s start our journey with #3:

3

Jonathan Davis switches from the #49 he wore over the past two years to Brandon Drury’s old #3. He wore #67 when he was first called up to Toronto.

4

George Springer has worn #4 his entire career and he will continue to do so this year when he debuts with the Blue Jays. Last year third base coach Luis Rivera wore #4 so he has switched to...

20

Luis Rivera first wore #63 when he first became coach in Toronto in 2011 then switched to #2 before landing on #4 when Troy Tulowitzki was acquired. The fourth number Rivera will be wearing with the Jays ties him with Tim Leiper who wore four different numbers (#21 #23 #34 and #51) on the back of his Toronto uniform. Last year #20 was worn by Daniel Volgelbach and then Jonathan Villar who switched from #30 in mid-September.

6

One of the two players returning to the Blue Jays as a non-roster invitee Richard Ureña will don #6 in spring training a number last worn by Travis Shaw in 2020. Ureña spent last season in the Orioles’ system and wore #7 in his previous stint in Toronto. Speaking of #7...

7

The new owner of the #7 jersey in Toronto is Reese McGuire who is inheriting the number from another catcher Caleb Joseph. McGuire is switching because his old #10 now belongs to...

10

New free agent signing Marcus Semien who has worn #10 for the past six years with the Athletics.

22

We skip up a Roberto Alomar number of steps to #22 which will be worn by left-handed pitcher Steven Matz. Chase Anderson wore #22 last year but last Blue Jays southpaw to wear that number was none other than Jimmy Key. Matz has worn #32 his entire career with the Mets but that number was unavailable to him in Toronto as it is retired for Roy Halladay. Another pitcher who had to switch from #32 was...

34

Tyler Chatwood who had intermittently worn #32 for eight seasons in his career. Matt Shoemaker was the most recent Blue Jay to wear #34.

28

Minor league free agent signing Tyler White will be wearing #28 as an invitee in spring training. White wore #28 with the Dodgers in 2019 Billy McKinney wore #28 for the Jays over his three seasons in Toronto.

30

Alejandro Kirk switches from his rookie number of #85 to #30 which was worn by Anthony Alford and Jonathan Villar in 2020. He went down 55 uniform numbers; looks like he may have lost 55 pounds too.

Captain Kirk is in the house! pic.twitter.com/I9mlE4947L — Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays) February 17 2021

35

David Phelps will wear #35 in his second stint with the Blue Jays the same number he wore in his first stint.

29

Phelps’ signing forces T.J. Zeuch to switch from #35 to #29. Zeuch has only made eight appearances for the Blue Jays but will be on his third number going into the 2021 season having previously worn #71 and #35. This will be the first number he has worn whose digits do not sum to 8.

39

Kirby Yates will continue wearing the #39 that he has worn for most of his career in 2021. Bench coach Dave Hudgens needs a new number so he selected...

19

The sacred number once worn by Jose Bautista. Two players Freddy Galvis and Alen Hanson briefly wore the number (Galvis only in early spring training) before public pressure from Blue Jays fans forced them to change. I wonder if Dave Hudgens feels that it would be OK to have #19 on his back because fans would rarely see his number on the field.

45

Returning to Toronto as a non-roster player after a few years away Francisco Liriano will be reclaiming his old #45 which he wore with the Blue Jays in 2016 and 2017. In the interim it had been assigned to Chris Rowley and Thomas Pannone.

50

Added to the 40-man roster this offseason catcher Riley Adams gets #50 after being assigned #76 for spring training 2020. Phillippe Aumont wore #50 before he became a farmer after COVID shut down spring training.

59

Josh Palacios will be wearing #59 in his debut season on the 40-man roster after wearing #77 in spring training last year.

60

Ty Tice who wore #73 in spring training last year gets a more roster-y number after being protected from the Rule 5 Draft. Justin Miller had this number in spring training last year.

64

Waiver pickup Joel Payamps will be wearing #64 this season having previously worn #35 and #36 while with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Héctor Pérez wore #64 in 2020 in his lone outing with the Blue Jays.

70

Catcher Gabriel Moreno another prospect who was added to the roster for protection from the Rule 5 Draft will be wearing a not-very-roster-y #70 in his first trip to big league spring training. Another catcher Patrick Cantwell had that number last spring training.

72

The longtime Westporter and her husband Frank received a Westport Arts Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012 for their contributions to film and television. That followed by 5 years a Friends of the Westport Library Special Friend Award.



The couple shared a career as pioneers during the golden age of television including founding New York City’s first public television station.

They later started Jacoby/Storm Productions and traveled to over 60 countries making educational documentary and corporate films.



In addition to her professional accomplishments she was a violinist (having studied at Juilliard from the age of 13) gardener knitter sculptor and adoring grandmother to Alana Maia Greg and Devon.

Her eldest granddaughter Alana is a musical theater writer theater-maker and educator. She lives in the Hudson Valley and wrote this remembrance:

When Doris Jacoby received a lifetime achievement award from her alma mater Brooklyn College in 2015 she suggested it be renamed a “lifetime achievement up until now award.” She said “I’m only 89 and I’m not done yet.”

No one would have blamed her for being “done.” Behind her lay a remarkable career in film and television. She still ran a film screening series at the Westport Library participated in a French conversation group and had only recently given up ice skating (after starting lessons at age 73. There was always a magical notion among my family that Doris might outlive us all.

She had been destined for a life in show business. The younger daughter of Manheim and Fannie “Bobbie” Rosenzweig she was born in 1926 in New York City. Her love of theater was firmly established by age 5 when she and her sister Sonya sold tickets to their productions around their neighborhood.

She followed in her musician mother’s footsteps and began training as a violinist at Juilliard at 13. Theater is how she met my grandfather: When she was 19 she and Sonya borrowed scenery from the local Jacoby Playhouse for a production at the theatrical school they’d founded. Frank Jacoby age 20 came to retrieve it.

They eloped 3 weeks later. Their marriage lasted 66 years until Frank’s death in 2012.

Doris and Frank’s professional relationship grew alongside their personal one and they soon found themselves pioneers in the Golden Age of Television. Frank worked behind the scenes while Doris flitted effortlessly between work behind and in front of the camera.

One moment she was a spokesperson appearing on one of the first live TV news programs as the Con Edison Girl extolling the wonders of electricity. The next she was crouched under a table slowly pulling a wick through a trick candle to create an illusion of a flame slowly disappearing for the opening segment of “Lights Out.”

Doris and Frank put Channel 13 on the air sparking a decades-long love of educational programming. They established Jacoby/Storm Productions (she was known professionally as Doris Storm) and traveled the world together making educational documentary and corporate films often working alongside their three sons Doug Bruce and Jeff. Their films included “The Wonderful World of Westport” created to celebrate the town’s 150th anniversary in 1985.

Doris defied gender expectations throughout her life. She received special permission to study physics in high school and was the only girl in her class.

She was the kind of woman who not only broke barriers but also turned around to help the next woman through. One day during her tenure as the first female senior vice president of the publishing firm Harcourt Brace Jovanovich she discovered her secretary sobbing in the restroom having been sent home for wearing a pantsuit to work. Doris assured her everything would be okay. She bought her own pantsuit after work that evening and wore it the next day. Doris paraded into every male executive’s office daring them to criticize her. No one said a word.

My grandmother was a true disciple of the tenet “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.” Her quick wit and dramatic instincts turned tales from her acclaimed career into the stuff of legends. In a favorite story whose details I never entirely understood even while she was telling it she claims to have single-handedly persuaded the government of Armenia to reinstate Daylight Savings Time in 1997.

I will always remember her in a t-shirt that read “If I knew grandchildren were so much fun I would have had them first.” I’ll remember her showing me how to plant vegetables and solve crossword puzzles stirring a bowl of chocolate pudding teaching me how to knit as we made a hat for my cousin.

My memories of folding laundry with her or peeling an apple in a single spiral stand out as brightly as memories of Broadway shows and strolling the streets of Paris. She was the kind of person it felt special to be around no matter what we did. She was an exceptionally excellent grandmother to me my sister Maia and my cousins Greg and Devon. She was incredibly well loved when she died peacefully at home on January 27.

If you feel inclined to donate in her memory our family asks you to consider 2 options. Doris was extraordinarily proud of the work she did to establish Devon’s Place a Boundless Playground in Norwalk that allows children of a wide range of abilities to play together. Named in honor of my youngest cousin the park has been hugely important to countless children since it opened in 2004. It is due to be renovated within the next year and we are currently collecting funds for this project.

Another wonderful option is to donate to the Reading Activity program at the Thomas Hooker School (138 Roger Williams Road Bridgeport CT 06610) where Doris read aloud to students up until her last few years. She touched many lives through this program.

POR OSCAR PATIÑO RIVEROS

Hoy todo pasa por las redes sociales y el deporte no escapa a este fenómeno. Los futbolistas ya no solo juegan dentro del campo de juego también lo hacen fuera tanto en la previa como en el pospartido.

El teléfono celular prácticamente pasó a formar parte del kit de fútbol de los atletas y muchos de ellos se destacan solo en las “redes” y desaparecen al entrar a la cancha.

Crónica habló con el exfutbolista colombiano hoy en día técnico Edison Mafla quien entre otras cosas destacó que la tecnología se convirtió en un problema dentro del deporte rey.

“La tecnología le vuelve loco a los jóvenes no se dejan aconsejar es una lástima. Les va bien en uno o dos partidos y creen que la saben todas” dijo el exatleta nacido en Florida Valle del Cauca el 14 de agosto de 1971.

A lo largo de su carrera jugó en grandes clubes como Deportivo Cali América de Cali Independiente de Santa Fe y Deportes Quindío de su país. Además vistió la casaca de la Universidad de Chile donde fue compañero del paraguayo Richard Báez Alianza Lima de Perú y Aucas de Ecuador. También pasó por el Villarreal de España.

“Tuve la suerte de jugar en grandes clubes y en cada uno de ellos di lo mejor que podía; además aprendí cosas de mis compañeros y siempre traté de escuchar a los mayores en el Cali por ejemplo jugué al lado de Jorge Amado Nunes él y otros de experiencia me arroparon y me hicieron crecer cuando llegué al Cali” afirmó.

LO DIJO

“TUVE LA SUERTE DE JUGAR EN GRANDES CLUBES Y EN CADA UNO DE ELLOS DI LO MEJOR QUE PODÍA; ADEMÁS APRENDÍ COSAS DE MIS COMPAÑEROS Y SIEMPRE TRATÉ DE ESCUCHAR A LOS MAYORES EN EL CALI POR EJEMPLO JUGUÉ AL LADO DE JORGE AMADO NUNES ÉL Y OTROS DE EXPERIENCIA ME ARROPARON” EDISON MAFLA Exjugador colombiano

Se retiró del fútbol profesional en 2004 a causa de una lesión

Mafla dejó el fútbol profesional hace casi 17 años fue en el 2004 jugando en Aucas de Ecuador y lo hizo a raíz de una lesión.

“Todos los jugadores estamos expuestos a lesiones eso lo sabemos desde que arrancamos nuestras carreras pero pese a eso debemos siempre dar lo mejor en cada entrenamiento en cada partido y yo siempre lo hice. Y fueron las lesiones las que me empujaron a dejar el fútbol todavía podía haber jugado por un buen tiempo pero ya no se pudo” acotó.

“Los paraguayos son solidarios y espontáneos” afirmó Edison

Jorge Amado Núnes Richard Báez y Ángel Gustavo Sotelo son tres de los paraguayos que jugaron con Edison Mafla a lo largo de su carrera. Para el cafetero fue una gran experiencia compartir con nuestros compatriotas en este sentido dijo: “Fue una linda experiencia haber jugado con varios paraguayos cuando yo llegué al Cali era muy joven y lo recuerdo muy bien a Jorge Amado Núnes un gran compañero. En Chile tuve la suerte de jugar con Richard Báez los paraguayos en general son solidarios y espontáneos” lanzó.

El gran valor que tiene para él la educación que se trae de la casa

Para el entrenador de 49 años los técnicos tienen la capacidad de influir en la vida de los futbolistas pero lo que marca el rumbo de un jugador es la educación que recibió en su casa.

“Los técnicos le podemos dar una mano al jugador podemos mejorar la técnica podemos aconsejar sobre todo en base a la experiencia que ya tenemos pero la clave está en la educación que cada uno recibió en su casa lo que le inculcaron en sus casas es la base de todo” remarcó Edison Mafla.

En Colombia se cortan los procesos por “presión” he’i

A inicios de diciembre del 2020 Carlos Queiroz dejó de ser el entrenador de la selección de Colombia luego de la derrota contra Ecuador para Mafla en su selección hay mucha presión por eso se cortan los procesos y no llegan los buenos resultados.

“En Colombia se cortan los procesos muy rápido por eso no se llega muy lejos. Los directivos de la Federación tienen mucha presión encima hay que darle confianza al DT y a los jugadores. Además hay que tener en cuenta que las eliminatorias sudamericanas son las más difíciles del mundo” remarcó.",,,,,,,,,

(WHAM) - The Victor based producer and marketer of beer wine and spirits is accused of breaching a deal on the use of the Corona brand name by applying it to a product other than beer

Modelo alleges Constellation does not have the right to use the brand to market non-beer products according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Monday.



The variety of spiked seltzer drinks uses the Corona trademark on its products.

Modelo said the licensing arrangement for Corona only extended to beer and did not include hard seltzer according to Reuters.



Corona Hard Seltzer is the fourth largest hard seltzer brand behind White Claw Truly and Bud Light Seltzer.

Constellation Brands statement provided to 13WHAM:

""While we generally don’t comment in specific detail about matters involving litigation what we can say is that we’re frankly very surprised by this development. We find these claims including the insinuation that Corona Hard Seltzer should not be classified as beer or a version thereof to be completely without merit a blatant attempt to restrain a strong and well-established competitor in a high growth segment of the U.S. beer category and completely misaligned with general industry and legal standards. We have fully and completely complied with the terms of our sublicense agreement including the sublicense agreement’s dispute resolution procedures. We will vigorously defend our rights under our sublicense agreement and applicable law and we look forward to continuing to build momentum for the Corona Hard Seltzer brand for many years to come.""

While there are always the traditional malt alcohol-based options with a refreshing fruity flavor there are also some new twists joining the game like iced tea hard seltzers and lemonade-inspired sips.

Opening your own business is rarely as straightforward as you might hope and finding a foothold in a notoriously insular marketplace can be almost impossible.

Long-time resident Craig White owner of White Smoke has been through every step in that process pivoting smoothly from restaurateur to running his own meat production company out of Saitama Prefecture. Today his extensive lineup of traditional Texas-style barbecue — slow-smoked ribs chicken bacon and sausage — is served at high-end hotels and restaurants across the country and sold in stores such as Costco Japan and Dean & DeLuca.

White acknowledges the tremendous luck he’s had in getting to where he is today but also says “luck is a matter of opportunity meeting preparedness.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9sYXB0b3AvYXN1cy1yb2ctZmxvdy14MTMteGctbW9iaWxlLWVncHUtcGgtcHJpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASUS ROG Flow X13 ROG XG Mobile eGPU launches in PH priced,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.yugatech.com', port=443): Read timed out.

For just the mind-blowingly low price of $30 you can get yourself one of these in-demand blankets which typically retail for well over $100. Unfortunately our favorite warehouse retailer doesn’t always have these trendy blankets in stock (and when they do they fly out the door) so that means it’s time to get creative. So we went on a shopping excursion for Pendleton blanket lookalikes and we’re reporting back with the nearly identical finds that won’t break the bank.

Whether you’re into the sherpa-lined versions traditional Southwestern print or the checkered style we’ve searched high and low through the depths of the internet to find the best Pendleton blanket alternatives. For as low as $22 on Amazon you can get the same exact look as the cult-favorite Pendleton throw blanket—that’s about $100 cheaper. Trust us these picks are so similar we almost couldn’t tell the difference.

The punk rocker and rebel winemaker of Jason Parkes Customs just opened Crown & Thieves in West Kelowna a winery that defies explanation.

Located in a vineyard just off Brown Road the winery rises four storeys and resembles the ruins of a 400-year-old castle.

Yet inside the vibe and decor is Prohibition-era speakeasy and haunted mansion parlour.

Parkes' other properties are also unconventional including The Hatch and Black Swift wineries also in West Kelowna and Truck 59 Cider next door to Crown & Thieves.

But Crown & Thieves has upped the ante.

""It was a dream of Jason's to do this concept"" said tasting room manager Shannon Forgues.

""We just opened and let it get crazy.""

The building is so eye-catching cool off-beat eccentric and unconventional that it caused a sensation as soon as it opened last month with people clamouring to get in for a look and a taste.

Of course it's also oh-so Instagrammable and Crown & Thieves has become a social media darling as a result.

""People are always after what's exciting and new and being exciting and new during COVID when people have little else to do really helped launched us"" said Forgues.

Crown & Thieves was a wine brand for years out of The Hatch.

But Parkes deemed it was time Crown & Thieves had its own bizarro digs to perpetuate the 'made by scoundrels sipped by kings' motto.

The scoundrels are the 'thieves' who steal from tanks and barrels to make wine and the kings are the 'crown' or the customers that drink the vintages.

Crown can also refer to the ruined castle theme and thieves a nod to all the mugshots of 1800s criminals on the walls.

It's all well and good to have a gimmick but the wine has to be tasty and it is.

The winery has a line up that includes a Winemaker's Wench white blend named after Parkes' wife Hickenbothom Chardonnay Scoundrel's Punch and Dimber Damber red blends Crybaby Malbec Roussanne Chenin blanc and Gewurztraminer.

Architect Kimberly Fuller of Lake Monster Studio in Vernon designed the winery and Bronag Contracting built it.

Both firms also worked on Black Swift Winery.

Parkes’ next project is under-construction The Hatching Post microbrewery in West Kelowna which will be similarly quirky with a Wild West facade and theme.

Jason Parkes Customs also makes wine for Indigenous World Winery in West Kelowna Burnt Timber Winery in Kelowna and consults with Lakeside Winery in Osoyoos.

Crown & Thieves has limited opening right now because of COVID for tours and tastings 11 am to 6 pm Thursdays through Mondays.

Post-pandemic the winery will make full use of its basement speakeasy bar main floor tasting room and wine shop and terrace third floor mezzanine and rooftop deck.",,,,,,,,,,,,

February 20 2021

Story By Ali Mansour

While the Overland trend continues to be at the forefront of the off-road hobby there’s another area that’s gaining serous momentum. We’re not talking about one particular part of the hobby or even a specific vehicle make. What we are referencing is the popularity of fullsize 4x4s back on the trail. Fullsize is a generality used to encompass any truck or SUV that’s ½-ton or larger.

Vehicles such as the Ford Super Duty Chevy Suburban Dodge Ram and Ford Bronco (fullsize generations of course) all have become a part of the fullsize trend. For those looking to create a larger base camp and casual off-road explorer the fullsize option has long been a popular choice. The big difference here is that this mix of full-bodied classics and modern tow rigs are now joining the action on more serious trails. Recently we took at look at some of the main reasons why fullsize rigs have made a comeback (read about it here). In this article we’re going to look at five outstanding and very different examples of fullsize rigs that are proven winners on the trail.

Sledge

Taking a Crew Cab Cummins-powered Ram rock crawling might sound a little crazy but for Cooper Rasmussen it's just another adventure behind the wheel of the 2017 Ram 2500 he calls Sledge. While many tow rigs see the occasional dirt road Sledge pushes the envelope of what a tow rig can (and should) do. It’s fit with a twin-turbo 6.7L Cummins diesel engine which has been thoroughly gone through by Dynomite Diesel Products.

Putting down over 600hp to the ground this truck has no problem moving the 40-inch-tall Nitto Trail Grapplers. Of course 4.88 Nitro Gears in the differentials along with a fully built BD Diesel 68RFE transmission helps with that effort. On the bed a Nemesis Industries rack secures the James Baroud Discover XXL roof-top tent. With an assortment of upgrades from companies such as American Expedition Vehicles RCV Performance and PSC Motorsports (to name a few) this truck has the right gear to survive the trail and maintain status as a daily driver. It’s an amazing example of just how far you can push the late-model Ram platform.

Killer K30

When it comes to building hardcore fullsize Chevy and GMC trucks there’s no name more well-known than Offroad Design. Based out of Carbondale Colorado Offroad Design has been turning out some of the toughest off-road products and General Motors vehicles for years. Using events such as King of the Hammers and Ultimate Adventure to hone in its wares ORD has proven time and time again that there are plenty of capable non-Jeep options for those looking to conquer trails in a domestic platform.

Loosely based on a 1985 Chevy K30 ORD owner Stephen Watson showcased that the classic square body Chevy has plenty to offer in the rocks. Using a Cadillac Escalade sourced L92 V8 TH400 and ORD’s Magnum underdrive box mated to a NP205 the powertrain is a great mix of new and old. With a multilink coilover suspension holding the 1-ton axles in place the limitations of the original leaf-sprung suspension are long removed. The combination of off-the-shelf parts wonderfully executed fab work and well-fitting 40-inch Trail Grapplers makes this Bowtie a posterchild for fullsize potential.

EVO Z71

With nearly 300000 miles on the original engine and trail scars from front to rear Mel Wade’s 2000 GMC 1/2-ton has the right parts to let this pickup go the distance. From the Baja 1000 to the JL Experience this solid-axle converted GMC has seen it all. Originally built by Off Road Evolution for Ultimate Adventure the truck has evolved into a chase truck of sorts for the Wade family.

The high-mileage GMC uses a mix of EVO MFG parts 1-ton axles and most recently moved up to 42-inch-tall Nitto Trail Grapplers. The EVO Z71 (or Chase 12 as the Wade’s often call it) is a great example of taking an incredibly common platform and transforming it into a multipurpose rig. With incredible cage work keeping occupants safe a custom cantilever bypass setup out back and a frame chop that took place at the front not the rear of the bed there are plenty of small details to uncover on this truck.

Check out our full video feature on it HERE

Doomsday HMMWV

Part of the draw of the military HMMWV is that they are extremely bare bones. Short for High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle the HMMWV boasts an impressive 16 inches of ground clearance. While something so stripped down may scare many away for Joey Osborne the ’92 HMMWV was the perfect blank canvas to create something beyond your run-of-the-mill wheeling machine. Using Predator Motorsports to install the modern Duramax powerplant and assortment of bolt-on upgrades the vehicle was then moved to Vice Unlimited.

There it would receive a variety of armor body and interior upgrades that would bring this war machine into the future. While most of these rigs were originally paired with 36-inch-tall treads this one got a bump up to 40s. Though they are becoming a bit scarcer HMMWV’s and even H1 Hummers have gained serious popularity and aftermarket support over the past few years.

Thunder Truck

Before moving to the J2000 you see here Harris Wells owned a heavily modified Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon JK. While the JK had taken him everywhere he wanted to go it was something that he felt he had to be more cautious with on the trail. Once he sold the JK he was looking for a rig that could fill the 4x4 void in his life but also double as a useful work truck around the house. That’s where the 1973 classic Jeep pickup comes into the picture.

Dubbed Thunder Truck this build would take its fair share of serious upgrades (new axles coilover suspension custom bumpers and so on). Even with the new parts it would still be a fraction of the investment of the JK. With the help of Godde Welding out of Rosamond California Harris was able to breathe new life into a classic fullsize Jeep. Sure now that the Gladiator is out Jeep trucks on 37’s are commonplace. However it still doesn’t take away from this classic iron on Ridge Grapplers.

Speaking during a webinar series presented by the National Safety Council as part of its SAFER: Safe Actions for Employee Returns initiative BAE Systems’ Safety Health and Environment Manager Alex Eggleston said the COVID-19 pandemic “is forcing folks to embrace more readily technology and innovation.”

NSC says organizations at the forefront of adopting technology during the pandemic “saw a boon” that enabled them “to more quickly shift to new modes of working leveraging tools and platforms for both safety and productivity.”

Technologies include wearable proximity detectors contact-tracing apps touch-free methods for workers to clock in and out and motion-sensing doors at facilities.

Garner-Janna “We started out with ‘What could we do right away to ensure that our employees were safe and had the best level of protection possible?’” Michelle Garner-Janna executive director of corporate health safety and environment at Cummins Inc. told Safety+Health. “Since the early days of the pandemic our solutions have evolved based on new information as well as new needs. Sometimes it takes a crisis like this to really see what you’re capable of doing.”

One of the company’s success stories involves the development and use of collaborative robots or “cobots” which have been used in its operation for some time but now can be expanded as a tool to help reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19.

“Cobots can allow for an individual employee to perform more than one task” Garner-Janna said “while also working collaboratively with the cobot in the workstation and allowing for appropriate social distancing between employees in a safe and efficient manner.”

Bobbie Schaefer risk engineering manager at the IoT innovation lab at The Hartford insurance company said during a SAFER webinar that amid the pandemic many technology providers either have adapted existing devices or created new ones “to help provide some relief and assistance to employers by helping them in implementing these new safety practices.”

As an example she pointed to the evolution of artificial intelligence technologies: Whereas the technology already had the capability to identify the presence of – or the lack of – personal protective equipment being worn Schaefer said some developers have adjusted AI to detect facemask use too.

Maintaining morale and looking ahead

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has reached the one-year mark the various adjustments employers have made can still feel burdensome to workers. Adrian Russell project manager for Mattcon General Contractors Inc. said promoting a message of togetherness among employees has been effective at limiting worker pushback.

“We feel that by individuals taking on a team mentality being mindful of one another respecting one another and doing their best every single day and never taking shortcuts never cheating the system we believe that we’re doing everything we can to protect ourselves as well as those around us” Russell said.

Kathy Freeman director of safety at HEI Civil a general contractor said the company’s campaigns to promote COVID-19 self-awareness help “keep it fresh.” No matter the campaign or activity supervisors strive to reinforce the theme that worker safety and health is essential to the operation. “It’s been a challenge” Freeman said “but they’ve pulled through.”

From morale boosters and workspace adjustments to implementing technology experts say employers need to both maintain their current efforts and look ahead.

“From a planning standpoint safety professionals really are going to need to be sure that they have plans in place that are going to work for the next pandemic because the reality is we will see another pandemic likely in our lifetime” Roy said. “And so we need to be better prepared for it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmRib2R5Z3JlZW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2hvdy10by1oeXBub3RpemUteW91cnNlbGbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Ultimate Guide To Self-Hypnosis: How To Plus Tips & Tricks,"Your goals don't end when your self-hypnosis session is done!

Last week Cummins was unveiled as the NSW captain for the 2021 Marsh Cup which was interpreted as a clue he was being primed for higher honours when Tim Paine calls it quits.

Cummins made his captaincy debut against Victoria at North Sydney Oval on Monday with the Blues securing a comfortable 59-run victory.

Although many believe pace bowlers shouldn’t be given captaincy duties due to their heavy workload in the field the 27-year-old showed no signs of fatigue on Monday.

After smacking a career-best 49 with the bat Cummins snared three wickets in Victoria’s innings to complete a stellar all-round performance.

Speaking before the domestic one-dayer Smith was asked on radio if there was any reason Cummins can’t captain Australia.

“Good question. I think being a fast bowler it would be tough. But that’s not for me to really answer” he told SEN.

When asked if he was impressed with Cummins’ captaincy after NSW’s win over Victoria Smith didn’t exactly jump on the opportunity to applaud his teammate.

“He was good; pretty easy day I think today” Smith said.

“I don’t think there was too much to do. Not a tough day but did good on his first day.”

The panellists on ABC’s Offsiders program were taken aback by Smith’s lukewarm comments agreeing the remarks indicated Smith was eager to reclaim the Australian captaincy.

“Hardly an endorsement”host Kelli Underwood said on Sunday morning. “That’s a man who wants his captaincy back. I don’t think he’s going to get it.”

Smith has not captained Australia since the infamous ball-tampering saga in 2018 when he received a one-year suspension from the sport.

ABC commentator Alister Nicholson elaborated: “Cricketers are so good at playing a straight bat. They know how to deliver the right line to a difficult question typically. For him to deviate so far away from that I think is quite telling.

“I wish Steve Smith didn’t want the captaincy back. I think he’s so much a better player without it and without that burden on his shoulders.

“But still he’s a professional athlete and he’s driven by the want to be the absolute best he can be and he wants to right the wrong of before and be the captain again. But I don’t think he will be.

“And Pat Cummins is the complete package. I think he’d do a great job.”

English cricket commentator Alison Mitchell explained why fast bowlers are typically not considered for leadership positions in cricket.

“You watch Pat Cummins in a Test match or any fast bowler and they go down to fine leg and third man and they are exhausted” Mitchell said.

“To then be at mid on mid off having to think of bowling changes that thing about when to bring yourself on it can sometimes make bowlers reticent to bowl themselves at the right moment.

“I think he’d be a fantastic leader of men but I do think that it’s very difficult for a fast bowler to give of their best in a Test team and deal with everything else that comes with captaincy on field as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hlbi1jYWxscy10aGUtaGVhcnQtc2Vhc29uLTgtY2FzdC1jaGFyYWN0ZXJzLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'When Calls the Heart': Meet the Season 8 Cast and Characters,"'When Calls the Heart' returns on Feb. 21.

Pascale Hutton and Kavan Smith (Rosemary and Lee Coulter)

Rosemary (Pascale Hutton) and Lee Coulter (Kavan Smith) are a fan-favorite couple. The vivacious Rosemary originally had a relationship with Jack Thornton but later found love with Lee Coulter. The couple’s struggle to start a family has been a theme in past seasons and many Hearties hope they achieve their dream of becoming parents this season.

Hutton has appeared in Hallmark movies such My One and Only and The Perfect Bride. Coulter has appeared in numerous TV shows including Stargate: Atlantis and Supernatural.

Jack Wagner (Bill Avery)

Many Hearties hope we’ll see more of the romance between Dr. Carson Shepherd (Paul Greene) and nurse-turned-doctor Faith Carter (Andrea Brooks). Their relationship was on pause for much of season 7 as Faith was away at medical school. (In reality Brooks was on maternity leave.) But she’s back in Hope Valley in season 8 so hopefully things will pick up where they left off.

Greene is a model-turned-actor who has appeared in NCIS CSI and other shows. Carter splits her time between When Calls the Heart and Supergirl where she plays Eve Teschmacher.

Martin Cummins (Henry Gowen)

How do you give back during the holidays? #Hearties #CountdowntoChristmas pic.twitter.com/cDqDamnd8y — Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel) December 26 2020

As Henry Gowen Martin Cummins plays one of Hope Valley’s more complicated characters. He’s a somewhat unscrupulous businessman who ran a faltering oil company until Lucas offered to buy him out at the end of season 7. While he often clashes with other people in town he’s also shown a softer side at several points.

Cummins has appeared in shows such as Riverdale and The Killing and directed the 2000 movie We All Fall Down with Ryan Reynolds.

Aren Buchholz and Eva Bourne (Jesse and Clara Flynn)

CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZWhlYWx0aGNhcmVuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyL2N2cy1oZWFsdGgtYnVpbGRpbmctaG9tZS1oZWFsdGgtaHViLXRvLWJldHRlci1jYXJlLWZvci1zZW5pb3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Health Building 'Home Health Hub' to Better Care for Seniors,"CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) has allotted ample resources toward home- and community-based care over the past year. It has done so for several reasons CVS Health leaders point out.

For one investing in home-based care makes it easier for patients to access necessary services during the public health emergency. But CVS Health’s focus on the home is likely to last long after the pandemic has subsided.

In April CVS Health partnered with UCLA Health to enhance its in-home capabilities related to home infusion services. In January it then partnered with the Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) to offer in-home chemotherapy to cancer patients.

“Our transformation over the last decade has enabled us to become the nation’s leading diversified health services company” Karen Lynch the president and CEO of CVS Health said on the company’s Q4 earnings call on Tuesday. “Our presence in communities across the country allows us to meet consumers where they are and become a bigger part of their everyday health.”

Prior to the COVID-19 crisis CVS had just dipped its proverbial toes in the water of home-focused senior care.

In 2019 for instance it launched an in-home dialysis pilot program. In 2018 it strove to make its MinuteClinics more accessible to seniors.

The company’s in-home dialysis program has now become a major talking point for the company of late.

“We are bringing dialysis services into the home to better manage chronic kidney disease” Lynch said. “This program offers a simpler more patient-centered approach. It delays the onset of end-stage renal disease reduces hospital admissions and supports people with treatment options.”

Broadly the $69 billion merger with the health insurer Aetna in late 2018 signaled a shift in the CVS Health’s strategy. Although COVID-19 was an accelerator for its home-based care initiatives the Aetna merger created a health care giant while firmly integrating a home- and community-based focus into the company’s plans.

Once Aetna was on board CVS locations began adding more health services at their MinuteClinics enabling them to manage patients throughout their care journeys — even with at-home care plans.

On its end Aetna has partnered with popular “family-on-demand” startup Papa which sends “Papa Pals” into seniors’ homes to help with social isolation household needs and technology help among other challenges.

Aetna’s benefits have reflected its home-based care aspirations as well.

“I think in the broadest sense this should all be seen through the lens of helping our members age and thrive in place” Dr. Robert Mirsky Aetna’s CMO at the time told Home Health Care News in 2019 about the health plan’s expanded benefits. “This means providing all of the support whether it’s medical behavioral or social determinants of health so people can live in the least restrictive and most home-like setting possible.”

CVS Health’s ‘Symphony’

Most recently CVS Health partnered with Aloe Care to launch “Symphony” a medical-alert system that is designed to keep seniors safe and connected at home.

Symphony is a collection of in-home and wearable devices that are available in around 650 CVS stores and online. Its differentiator is that it includes a voice-activated smart hub that lets seniors call assigned caregivers or emergency responders hands-free throughout the day.

Sensors placed around the house can monitor motion temperature and air quality then alert caregivers of any abnormalities through an app.

It’s not a new idea but it’s an advancement of an old one. And it will help CVS Health continue to support seniors in their homes Adam Pellegrini the SVP of enterprise virtual care and consumer health at CVS Health told HHCN.

“CVS and other retail pharmacies have actually carried these types of systems for many years” Pellegrini said. “What we did look at was across the three different businesses we have what were we doing in that space for seniors that can go beyond that specific use case of an emergency alert when someone falls?”

Pellegrini ran Fitbit’s health care business and was also the VP of digital health at Walgreens before joining CVS Health in 2019.

Before teaming up with Aloe Care CVS Health conducted an extensive request for proposals (RFP) Pellegrini said.

“It was a methodical process” he said. “But again it was looking into the future of what we want to do not just replacing something that we currently do.”

CVS already sells over 350000 connected devices in its stores every year but the devices are not necessarily interconnected. Its vision is to connect all devices to what Pellegrini calls a “home health hub.”

Creating that sort of connectivity in the home would address social determinants of health and prevent falls one of the top reasons for hospitalizations among seniors.

Overall CVS Health sees Symphony as an extender of its health care plans which includes working with patients in the home more frequently.

Home-based care partnerships

Right now CVS Health is still in the beginning phases of its home-centric approach.

But the company wants to explore all avenues with Symphony and its other home-based care endeavors. That includes working with home health and home care agencies in the future.

“We’re open to all those types of discussions for sure” Pellegrini said. “Right now we’re just really getting user feedback looking at all the different ways that we can work with our partners. The idea here is to keep seniors safe in the home. … I think COVID has accelerated some of our original thinking.”

Aetna has been putting a lot of energy into addressing social determinants of health on its end over the last couple of years.

CVS is now hoping to spearhead some of those logistical challenges in the home with its growing capacity to provide care outside its own walls.

“You can almost imagine how the future of these home health hubs for seniors really integrates with mechanisms that address social determinants of health” Pellegrini said. “With Symphony the caregiver can monitor the loved one from anywhere around the world really. So you can imagine extended care teams also getting keyed into resources as well to really address social determinants of health.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvQ29zdGNvLWJlZ2lucy1vZmZlcmluZy1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy12YWNjaW5lcy1hdC0xNTk2NjczNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco begins offering coronavirus vaccines at Bay Area store,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Costco-begins-offering-coronavirus-vaccines-at-15966737.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvQ29zdGNvLWJlZ2lucy1vZmZlcmluZy1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy12YWNjaW5lcy1hdC0xNTk2NjczNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbGV4LXBlcmV6LXZzLW1hdHQtc2NobmVsbC0yMjQ1Mzc3NDguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Perez vs. Matt Schnell headed to UFC's May 15 lineup,"Recent flyweight title challenger Alex Perez has the first dance partner for his attempt to climb back into contention.

Perez (24-6 MMA 6-2 UFC) will take on Matt Schnell (15-5 MMA 5-3 UFC) this spring at UFC 262. A person with knowledge of the booking confirmed the matchup to MMA Junkie following an initial report from MMA DNA. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the UFC has not yet made a formal announcement.

The UFC’s May 15 card though not publicly announced is likely to be UFC 262. No venue or location has been finalized.

Perez took a three-fight winning streak including stoppages of Jordan Espinosa and Jussier Formiga into a title shot with flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo this past November at UFC 255. A fairly sizable underdog in the fight around +250 Perez was submitted less than two minutes into the fight with a guillotine choke.

Schnell got back in the win column a little more than a month ago when he took a split decision from Tyson Nam on “Fight Island” in Abu Dhabi. That got him back on track after a knockout loss to Alexandre Pantoja in late 2019. Before that setback Schnell had a four-fight winning streak that had him in title contention himself.

With the addition the May 15 UFC lineup now includes:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of February 22,"Market sentiment continues to be centered around the government’s stimulus package which is expected to be finalized late next week after the recent revision. Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

Senior Jacob Dice and junior Spencer Sherwood were given the idea by shop teacher Phil Maxwell.

“He came to us and to see if we wanted to do a special project for charity that would catch the eye of people” Spencer explained.

Maxwell suggested they go to the Toys for Joys website a Washington company that provides plans and blueprints for various types of toys.

“We picked a tractor because we both kind of grew up on farms and enjoy country stuff” Jacob said.

The project chosen included several pages of intricate blueprints to follow.

“There was a lot of trial and error and a lot of small pieces we had to do our own customization for” Jacob noted.

They estimate it took them a total of about 24 hours to complete most on their own time.

“It was a challenge” Spencer admitted.

The boys did about 97 percent of the project on their own according to Maxwell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3FjdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZGVlcmUtY28tcmVwb3J0cy1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLW5ldC1wcm9maXQtb2YtMS0yMjQtYmlsbGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlXzUyOWYyNTgyLTkzYmItNTM1Yi04ZDk5LTI0NjE1YzhhMTExZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deere & Co. reports first quarter net profit of $1.224 billion,"Moline-based Deere & Co. on Friday reported a net income of $1.224 billion or $3.87 per share for the first quarter that ended Jan. 31.

That is more than double the $517 million in net income the company reported at the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Worldwide net sales and revenues increased 19 percent in the first quarter of 2021 to $9.112 billion. Equipment operations net sales were $8.051 billion for the quarter compared with $6.530 billion in 2020.

“John Deere started 2021 on a strongly positive note” Deere CEO John May said in a news release Friday.

“Our results were aided by outstanding performance across our business lineup and improving conditions in the farm and construction sectors” May said. “In addition our smart industrial operating strategy is making a significant impact on the company’s results while it also helps our customers be more profitable and sustainable.”

According to the news release beginning in fiscal year 2021 the company implemented a new strategy operating model and reporting structure. With this change the company’s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments.

The production and precision agriculture segment is responsible for defining developing and delivering global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains small grains cotton and sugar. Main products include large and certain mid-size tractors combines cotton pickers sugarcane harvesters and loaders and soil preparation seeding application and crop care equipment.

The small agriculture and turf segment is responsible for defining developing and delivering market-driven products to support mid-size and small growers and producers globally as well as turf customers. The operations are principally organized to support production systems for dairy and livestock high-value crops and turf and utility operators. Primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors as well as hay and forage equipment riding and commercial lawn equipment golf course equipment and utility vehicles.

There were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result the company has four reportable segments.

Net income for Deere & Co. for fiscal year 2021 is forecast to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion.

“We are proud of our success executing the strategy and creating a more focused organization that can operate with greater speed and agility” May said. “As our recent performance shows these steps are leading to improved efficiencies and helping the company target its resources and investments on areas that have the greatest impact.

“At the same time even as we ramp up factory production and intensify our efforts to serve customers we are mindful of the continuing challenges associated with the global pandemic” May added. “We remain committed above all else to safeguarding the health and well-being of our employees.”

Like a swarm of wasps all with their own distinct motors and color schemes.

Spanning the decades more than 500 snowmobiles lined the ice on Detroit Lake Saturday Feb. 20 for the annual ULTRA Vintage Snowmobile rally part of Polar Fest 2021.

Also after extreme cold weather delayed the Poles 'N Holes ice fishing derby and the Kool Kites on the Lake demonstration both Polar Fest 2021 events finally kicked off along side the snowmobile rally; bringing hundreds to the lake's frozen surface.

""It is an awesome turnout"" said Jeff Alberts trail administrator for ULTRA Snowmobile Club. ""It's the biggest turnout we've had in 18 years.""

Alberts said riders showed up to the rally from Montana Wisconsin South Dakota North Dakota and Michigan.

""A lot of them came in on Friday so you know there are some hotel rooms being used up"" he said. ""It's just a good time and it's actually pretty decent weather ... plenty of snowmobiles and there is enough snow to ride yet so come Monday there might not be.""

Riders entered their snowmobiles to be judged in 21 different categories of customization and class for bragging rights and trophies.

""Due to the great turnout it's been great"" said Tommy Ailie local announcer. ""There's been all kinds of sleds lots of people decent weather little bit on the brisk side but not enough to keep anybody home it looks like.""

Ailie said he's hosted the event for the last five or six years and will keep doing it if the club keeps asking him. He also highlighted some of the more unique snowmobiles at the rally.

""That sled is made out of a riding tractor"" he said. ""We got an old Ford Model-T that's been converted into a snow machine one-of-a-kind sleds out here custom jobs ... they got a little bit of everything.""

Decorating the frozen skyline for the rally the Kool Kites on the Lake flying demonstration featured a dozen larger-than-life kites for visitors to enjoy and even handle.

Barbara and Alex Meyer of Maple Grove Minn. brought their kites up from the Twin Cities and were both delighted there was a brisk wind blowing across the lake.

The Meyers said they have been making and flying kites since the late 1970s after thinking sail boating might be too expensive a hobby to maintain.

Barbara said she has made between 40 to 50 kites since last March due to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced many people to double-down on their hobbies.

Their kite Chinese Dragon is 50 feet long and needs 1800-pound test line but the couple said they ordered it commercially.

""It's pretty much like a giant wind sock"" she said.

Also the Pole 'N Holes ice fishing derby brought hundreds of ice fishermen after being delayed twice since Feb. 6 .

The tournament coincides with the statewide virtual fishing derby hosted via the Fish Donkey app which runs from Feb. 12 to Feb. 28.

Winners will be announced on the Poles 'N Holes Facebook page and website .

Approximately 2425ha of predominantly heavy land is farmed from the company’s Milton Ernest base mostly combinable arable cropping.

The business also separately contract farms 1400ha of arable crops near Leicester.

“Our Bedfordshire machinery fleet included 14 tractors from 120 to 620hp” says assistant arable manager ‘JJ’ Ibbett.

All except six were John Deere but because we tended to add to the fleet rather than trade in we not only had operating systems from two manufacturers but also a range of concepts on tractors of various sizes and ages making operations complex especially for seasonal workers.

“We therefore reduced and updated the fleet standardising where possible for improved reliability and efficiency and to lessen our peak labour requirement.

“With other machinery updated at the same time seven tractors were replaced by four more versatile machines.”

30 years of John Deere

John Deere tractors have been used on this farm for more than 30 years and large high horsepower machinery has been favoured.

Supplied by local John Deere dealer P Tuckwell the new arrivals included a 6155R and the three 6250R models which have been key to the tractor fleet changes.

The choice of the 6250Rs was based on their year-round suitability for almost any task matched with full-time operators and working a large number of hours. Their role includes primary and secondary cultivations ploughing corn carting muck spreading drilling and hedgecutting plus other general work.

“Our previous 6210R was versatile but couldn’t do enough of the key tasks” said Ibbett.

“We also have a 7310R which suits heavier cultivations and drilling but it’s bigger than necessary for other work.

“Reviewing the operating hours across our fleet demonstrated that tractors under 230hp worked the most.

Therefore the 6250R with up to 275hp and enough traction for 80% of our work was the logical option and having three identical models together with duplicated implements meant they would be busy throughout the year.

“Understandably there was some initial reluctance to move from larger tractors but we tried a demonstration 6250R and all liked it especially the CommandPRO joystick.

“It’s easy to set up and use and the creep feature is superb. Although we considered other brands initially these didn’t progress to demonstrations as the John Deere solution seemed ideal and back-up from our dealer is so good.”

Use of Michelin tyres

It was also suggested that fitting the latest 650/85R38 and 600/70R30 Michelin AxioBib 2 tyres with VF technology would further improve performance from these versatile tractors.

Compared to standard tyres the AxioBib 2 VF can operate at 40% less pressure or carry 40 per cent extra load at a similar pressure while also achieving 28% to 35% more traction 7% to 10% increased productivity and a potential 4% yield increase from the enhanced soil protection according to Michelin.

Local John Deere territory manager David Purdy is a tyre and soil protection specialist and he believes the tyre upgrade will provide multiple benefits.

Research indicates that soil damage can be substantially reduced by lowering axle weights to below 6t and getting tyre pressures down to single digits.

“The 6250R with AxioBib 2 VF tyres achieves both of these targets not to mention the potential for fuel savings.”"

It's been eight months since my first comparison of American and Delta and nothing has changed.

Delta is the clear winner here over American once more when it comes to social distancing in the skies. The middle seat blocking policy is a huge factor but the little things like giving passengers sanitary wipes when boarding and making sure passengers are informed about the safety measures being undertaken by the airline truly make the difference.

I still consider American to be one of the least safety-minded airlines when it comes to the pandemic when compared to the rest of the big four US airlines and didn't feel as if the airline was going above and beyond.

Delta wasn't without its mishaps as I did notice a lack of mask enforcement on my first flight and the seat on my second flight wasn't immaculately clean but I always felt safer on Delta than on American.

Some travelers are still skeptical about returning to the skies even with a vaccine and airlines should be focused on providing an experience that's over the top when it comes to safety.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vYmlsbC1tdXJwaHktanIvdGhlLWNlby1vZi1kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtanVzdC1leHBsYWluZWQtYS1yYWRpY2FsLWNoYW5nZS1oZXJlcy13aGF0LWl0LW1lYW5zLWZvci15b3UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The CEO of Delta Air Lines Just Explained a Radical Change.

Thomas Pallini/Insider

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have taken two very different approaches to the pandemic.

Delta has been blocking middle seats since April 2020 while American never embraced the policy.

I took three flights on both airlines in 2021 to see how the two were handling social distancing in the skies.

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were the two largest airlines in the US before the pandemic each generating billions in revenue each year and boasting the largest fleets of any global airline. Both offered similar products with the choice between the two coming down to factors like customer preference price and loyalty.

The divide between them widened during the pandemic however thanks to one key factor: safety. While Delta blocked middle seats through for most of 2020 American filed its planes to capacity as early as the summer.

I flew on both carriers in June 2020 on my first trip back to the skies since the pandemic began and found Delta to be a far sight better than American largely because of the former's above and beyond approach to safety. But as we enter a new year in aviation's recovery I wanted to see just how the two were faring nearly one year since COVID-19 upended aviation.

I took three flights across both airlines on a recent trip flying from New York to Miami on American and then from Houston Texas to Los Angeles via Salt Lake City on Delta. The result was surprising especially as the US continues to see record COVID-19-related deaths and a slow-going vaccine rollout.

Here's which one handled pandemic flying the best in 2021.

Ted Cruz's Feb. 18 flight from Cancun Mexico to Houston was leaked to the media.

What Happened: Cruz has been the subject of criticism after it was discovered he left Texas on Feb. 17 for a trip to Cancun with his daughters while many of his constituents were without power or water due to an unexpectedly harsh winter storm. When news of his Mexican excursion broke Cruz issued a statement saying that he was only accompanying his daughters to their vacation destination and would be back in Texas the next day.

However Edward Russell a reporter with the online travel news site Skift tweeted that an unnamed source within United informed him that Cruz had ""rebooked his flight back to Houston from Cancun for this afternoon at around 6 a.m. today (Thursday). He was originally scheduled to return on Saturday."" Russell acknowledged the leak after another travel industry journalist Thrifty Traveler editor Kyle Potter tweeted a photo showing Cruz's name on the upgrade list for the Feb. 18 afternoon flight from Cancun to Houston.

What Happens Next: United Airlines issued a statement to the online news site Politico saying the leak to Russell was under investigation.

""It's against United's policies to share personal information about our customers and we are investigating this incident"" the statement said adding that no options were ""off the table"" and the leaker could be terminated.

But tracking the leaker could be a daunting task as tens of thousands of United employees have access to customer flight data. And sympathy for the leaker was expressed on Twitter by Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.

""Perspective: whoever the ‘leak' is she/he/they have over 10k @united colleagues & families in TX who are freezing while their US Senator skips town & then tries to lie about it"" Nelson tweeted. ""@tedcruz is not a ‘customer' he's a public servant who has lied too many times. WE'RE ALL THE LEAK.""

CNN —

In January as Covid cases spiked in California refrigerated morgue trucks rolled into Los Angeles ICUs overflowed oxygen supplies depleted and full ambulances waited in lines for hours my wife Andrea and I faced a dilemma. The two of us had spent Christmas in Tucson and planned to drive home to Los Angeles but our 11-year-old son was in Florida with his biological dad. Andrea had a plane ticket to bring Wyatt back. But flying especially out of Los Angeles International Airport seemed too risky. Better to stay at super-clean Airbnbs order contactless food and drive across the country to Miami.

And so on January 18 we embarked on the strangest of American road trips crossing eight states and back 6000 miles in 18 days: a surreal and spectacular journey sure to reveal truths about our battered nation our resilient people and ourselves.

It was quiet and chilly for southern Arizona maybe 35 degrees when the eastern sky in the Patagonia hills just north of the border began to yellow. A cloudless day soon to warm; a good day for traveling east into Texas.

We rolled through dun-colored hills dotted with mesquite and scrub oak dipping into washes past ranches and brick farmhouses. To pass the time we listened to Barack Obama narrate his story in “A Promised Land” his voice a reassurance that we were easing into a more “normal” time caring for each other again.

So close we could call out to a friend in Mexico

In New Mexico we climbed a pass through the jagged-toothed Organ Mountains then plunged into a desert bowl stretching toward Alamogordo and the birthplace of the atomic bomb. Our destination was gentler — the gypsum dunes of White Sands National Park. A trickle of tourists only a few wearing masks rode down the soft sand hills in rented sleds another sign of life as it was and could be.

At dusk we reached El Paso. To our right Cíudad Juárez spread out vast and twinkling beyond the Rio Grande; so close it seemed we could call out the window and talk to a friend in Mexico. For years in the Trump era we’d heard the language of hate: walls and cages “animals” and “rapists.” Now it seems we have a chance to heal the wounds.

We spent our first night in the art-colony town of Marfa. I’d been here 46 years ago when I was 19. I’d stayed at the Hotel Paisano swilling down Texas Pride beer with a couple of local teenagers. Back then my room cost me $6 a night. Now suites run nearly 50 times that.

On the second day we drove south toward Presidio and Big Bend. The Rio Grande wound into view: silent green opaque. Here no border wall blocked our view; the Chihuahuan desert remained united by creosote tamarisk ocotillo prickly pear. We stopped listening for the faint voices carrying across the water from ranches on the Mexican side.

Often the river runs swift and deadly but at this time of year it’s slow and languorous.

We descended a low bank. Our little dog Rascal waded into the water lapping up the Rio Grande. Andrea began to record a video for Wyatt. “See look over there it’s Mexico! Right there!” she said.

We came upon a pickup truck hauling a horse trailer: “WYATT” read the sign on the trailer reminding us of our son the reason for our drive.

The next morning at a ghost town with spotty internet black storm clouds dissipated. From our rock-walled room we watched the presidential inauguration hearing a brilliant young poet Amanda Gorman praise a nation “bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free.”

Afterward we hiked Santa Elena Canyon through a Rio Grande gorge. Sheer limestone cliffs faced us from the Mexican side but we were distracted stepping into the brush every couple of minutes. The trail was packed and we were in a small minority wearing masks. On the day of the transfer of power many fellow Americans were making clear their own understanding of bold fierce and free.

People stare at us in our masks as if we are Martians

On day four rain pounded our roof as we rode out of Marathon toward San Antonio wipers on high. A crack appeared in our windshield; we monitored its growth with a piece of Scotch tape. The spray from the semis was intense. A truck began to fishtail just as I passed it. I squeezed the wheel. We’d slept in a trailer the night before and not well. Our host had urged us to use the bathroom in the trailer park to save on her water bill — a bizarre request during the pandemic. We ignored it.

I fought fatigue downing multiple Red Bulls from the cooler. Even the dog sensed the tension. Quietly Rascal climbed onto Andrea’s lap then slunk down to the floor at her feet staring up at me with worried black eyes as I squinted through the thick mist. I shook my head and slapped my face fighting exhaustion. Finally the clouds in the eastern sky broke apart.

Tense exhausting days like this are unavoidable in a quick trip cross country. We focused on staying healthy not an easy task when so many fellow citizens — in gas stations quick marts even takeout restaurants — refused to wear masks. The further east we drove the greater the disconnect.

Once at a Subway in Arizona a customer in front of me ignored the “mandatory mask” sign. When I asked the employee why they didn’t enforce wearing a mask she just shrugged. At a Texas barbecue joint as I waited for takeout in my “Green Bay Football” sweatshirt a man in a line of maskless bar patrons looked over loudly proclaiming the Packers would lose that coming weekend. (Alas he was correct.) But for the most part we faced little hostility. Sometimes people stared at us as if we were Martians but to our relief no one confronted us or spewed conspiracy theories. “There seemed to be a mutual desire to keep things gentle” Andrea observed — a modestly encouraging sign.

For our part we began donning two masks hoping our caution was sufficient protection.

Searching for NPR but finding only preachers and Christian rock

Two days later we rolled into Austin for a socially distanced weekend with my brother Yam and his family. There is nothing more welcoming than rest with family to break up a long road trip.

We sped down a two-lane blacktop into East Texas on day nine. Farmhouses dotted winter fields reminding Andrea of her native Nebraska. In the late morning under a brooding sky we crossed the last miles of East Texas. Traffic was light and we were skirting the rain. We put on Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Born on the Bayou.”

The dry washes of West Texas were a fading memory. Bridges forded brown-running creeks and streams. “Jesus heals a broken heart” a billboard promised. We passed country graveyards trees standing in swamps rusted tin-roof sheds. Distant clouds dropped rain on the horizon.

A bridge rose over the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Water lapped at the edge of humble shacks on the Louisiana side. We passed miles of Christmas tree plantations a topsoil farm logging trucks American flags Trump signs and Confederate flags. On the low end of the FM dial we searched for NPR but found only preachers and Christian rock.

We were deep into Trump country — poor country too. Astride the two-lane roads stood auto parts shops pawn shops Family Dollar Dollar Tree and Dollar General stores. There was hardly a grocery store in sight. Amid the food deserts a dollar store economy had sprouted catering to the convenience-store clerks the elderly Walmart greeters the jobless and countless others on the margins.

For miles we drove behind a white prison bus filled with men we could barely detect through the darkened barred windows.

The bus turned off and we crossed into Mississippi.

By nightfall on day 11 we reached the Atlantic coast of northern Florida: St. Augustine founded by the Spanish conquistadores in 1565. We walked the wet streets crossing into the old town festooned with white lights which shone in the puddles.

We reached the old town square built in 1573 — nearly 450 years ago and fully two centuries before the American revolution. “Why did we only learn about the pilgrims?” Andrea asked. We thought about whose history is privileged whose is diminished. America is so much more than our children are given to believe.

Finally in glitzy Miami Beach our reunion

As the light faded we waited alongside a public park. Now a car turned the corner and came to a stop. Wyatt jumped out. “Mama!” he cried running to embrace us.

Wyatt hugged his dad goodbye and bounded into our back seat: bright chattering laughing excited. As were we. Tonight a socially distanced dinner with Andrea’s family in town by chance.

On the morning of day 12 we stopped at a Cuban breakfast counter by the sea getting takeout empanadas and croquetas listening to the easy banter of old men. Andrea’s Cuban abuelita spent the last years of her life here two blocks away with other Cuban and Jewish retirees. Andrea remembers asking her Tita why some or her neighbors had numbers on their arms. A generation later come echoes from Wyatt: He asks if we will survive the killer pandemic. He asks why grownups are waving Confederate flags invading the Capitol building spewing the N-word killing police.

Now we drove north along the Florida Turnpike toward the Gulf Coast Wyatt in the back seat a new buoyancy to our journey.

The next day I was up at dawn. I picked up breakfast at a nearby store. A group of bearded maskless young men in camo — deer hunters I learned — traded easy banter with the masked employees. The hunters eyed me skeptically. Ordinarily I might engage them but today I kept my distance. Please don’t get sick I told myself. Hang on we’ll be home soon.

At 9 a.m. we took a low-tide walk into the mucky clam flats. Wyatt and Andrea got stuck and returned to shore. I kept walking thinking myself more capable then plunged face-first into the muck. “I don’t think anybody’s going to be hiring us to be clam diggers” Andrea remarked. We hosed off took showers and pointed west.

To California.

We picked up the pace riding the concrete bands past Chattahoochee and Lake Seminole through Mossy Head and Ponce de Leon across Pensacola Bay along the causeway through Mobile Bay and into Pass Christian on Mississippi’s Gulf Shore. I drove to a seafood restaurant for takeout. Inside it was packed no one but the servers wearing masks. People smiled at me in my N-95 bemused almost pitying as if I were the clueless one. I grabbed the foam takeout boxes and headed back to my family. Five more days.

We crossed the Mississippi in a hard rain spanned bridges over vast estuaries passing New Orleans and Baton Rouge and through the bowels of a fossil fuel economy: gas flares petroleum tank farms tankers loading oil for China and the Far East.

‘Don’t leave any of those California ideas around here’

On day 14 we were driving through pale green hills spotted with mesquite and cherry laurel into cutesy charming Fredericksburg Texas: lined with coffee shops candy sellers Hill Country wineries barbecue joints and plenty of places to get schnitzel. And many big red Trump signs which nearly two weeks after the inauguration remained standing. A battered hand-painted panel truck read cryptically “Trump Promises Kept.”

Outside of town a rancher in a Trump hat — our Airbnb host — pointed to our guest cottage on the plain. I went online to teach my USC class while Andrea went out with Wyatt who was in the white Stetson Andrea had found him in Tombstone for their adventures with the ranch puppies goats and donkeys. When they came back Andrea told me about a conversation she had.

“Where y’all from?” the Trump-hat rancher asked Andrea.

“California but don’t hold it against us” Andrea half-joked.

“That’s OK” he drawled. “Long as you don’t leave any of those California ideas around here.”

On day 15 at a tiny crossroads we ordered warm apple cobbler and bought the local paper. “Rancher indicted for theft of neighbor’s cow” read the headline. Not quite the same news that was making headlines around the country: A new administration impeachment Covid-19 surges.

Getting closer to home

Under a vast blue sky the rivers gave way to narrow creeks then dry washes. Down an arrow-straight road we passed the derricks pumping jacks and man camps of the West Texas oil patch then crossed into New Mexico. Tiny yuccas sprouted at the roadsides reminding us of our beloved Joshua trees of California. Yes getting closer.

As we drove Wyatt lost the signal of his fifth-grade Zoom class. He built a pillow fort for Rascal set his iPad to “Dog TV” and to relax him recited Edgar Allan Poe:

“Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted …tell me—tell me I implore!”

Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

Rascal listened politely. Tucson our last stay before home was two hours away.

On the morning of day 18 everyone was excited. “We’re going to actually be HOME today!” Wyatt exclaimed as we packed our things in our last Airbnb. Soon no more strangers’ beds no more takeout meals no more checking the tires oil coolant filling the tank or Googling the NPR frequency in Miami Mobile Baton Rouge Houston El Paso. And no more damn Red Bull. “I swear I’m never going to have another Red Bull as long as I live” Andrea said.

We got on the road for one last day. From the Saguaro cactus forest of the Tucson Mountains west to Picacho Peak then Phoenix endless Phoenix. We pushed through and the harsh yellow light of the Mohave Desert at midday. We were a hundred miles from California. Andrea put on John Denver. “Country roads take me home to the place I belong …” we sang together.

Now the exit to Joshua Tree and snow on the mountain at Idyllwild. So close.

It felt momentous. At the height of a deadly pandemic we’d traveled 6000 miles across a bruised and beautiful land encountering constant reminders of our political divisions but just as often signs of renewal. For that Andrea and I needed only to glance over our shoulders into the back seat. “One more hour!” Wyatt cried nearly bouncing through his seat belt.

Now finally we took California State Route 2 to our exit.

We rolled down the windows passed the long green expanse of Verdugo Park turned left into our wooded hills. We were alert our faces bright eyes wide. I took it slow. By now Rascal could smell where we were. He jumped on my lap as I drove perched his front paws at the base of the driver’s window mouth open in a smile tail wagging furiously.

“We’re home Rascal” Andrea said.

And so we were.

Then-East Chicago Fire Department Paramedic Randy Anderson opened Safari Beach on 45th Avenue in Munster in the early 1980s and it quickly became a destination for those seeking a more bronze hue.

The tanning salon took off so much he was able to quit his job and work full-time as a business owner.

""It started as a side project and blew up from there"" Anderson said.

His tanning business expanded to also include salons in Merrillville and Chicago. But in 2003 he sold them all to L.A. Tan a chain that quickly spread around the Region.

Anderson opened a new Safari Beach Tan in Valparaiso in 2004 with standup booths he developed.

""It's a quicker way to tan and much cleaner"" he said. ""You don't have to touch anything and it takes six to 10 minutes instead of 20 or 30 lying down. It's easier to keep cleaner.""

The concept proved popular and he expanded to Portage in 2004. Now he's expanding the chain further taking over Beach Tan Express salons his sister ran in Dyer and Crown Point and rebranding them.

Safari Beach Tan opened after extensive renovations at 901 Joliet St. in the same shopping mall as Jewel-Osco in Dyer and at 10763 Broadway across from Strack & Van Til in Crown Point. Anderson is planning another location potentially in Michigan City.

""A lot of tanning salons have gone out of business"" he said. ""The business has changed. When I started it was a lot of high school girls looking to get ready for prom. Now we also have a lot of older customers looking to get vitamin D take care of psoriasis or because they have seasonal affective disorder. Now the dermatologists are our competition.""

Both of the new tanning salons are about 1500 square feet with about 14 tanning booths. They also offer spray tans.

Safari Beach Tan is now gearing up for the traditional busy season in March April and May when people get tan for high school dances or to get ready for beach season in the summer. But the customer base has been getting more diverse.

""The older generation comes in just to feel better"" he said. ""Especially now with seasonal depression some people just come in for a little mini-vacation to get out of the house during COVID and winter. It's a nice 10-minute mini-vacation that makes people feel better.""

For more information visit safaribeachtan.som or call 219-322-3228 for the Dyer location or 662-4100 for Crown Point.

Only in the Region where the Fourth of July is roughly celebrated from the beginning of May to the end of September would a college be turned into a fireworks store.

CNN —

In January as Covid cases spiked in California refrigerated morgue trucks rolled into Los Angeles ICUs overflowed oxygen supplies depleted and full ambulances waited in lines for hours my wife Andrea and I faced a dilemma. The two of us had spent Christmas in Tucson and planned to drive home to Los Angeles but our 11-year-old son was in Florida with his biological dad. Andrea had a plane ticket to bring Wyatt back. But flying especially out of Los Angeles International Airport seemed too risky. Better to stay at super-clean Airbnbs order contactless food and drive across the country to Miami.

And so on January 18 we embarked on the strangest of American road trips crossing eight states and back 6000 miles in 18 days: a surreal and spectacular journey sure to reveal truths about our battered nation our resilient people and ourselves.

The hunters eyed me skeptically. Ordinarily I might engage them but today I kept my distance. Please don’t get sick I told myself. Hang on we’ll be home soon.

At 9 a.m. we took a low-tide walk into the mucky clam flats. Wyatt and Andrea got stuck and returned to shore. I kept walking thinking myself more capable then plunged face-first into the muck. “I don’t think anybody’s going to be hiring us to be clam diggers” Andrea remarked. We hosed off took showers and pointed west.

To California.

We picked up the pace riding the concrete bands past Chattahoochee and Lake Seminole through Mossy Head and Ponce de Leon across Pensacola Bay along the causeway through Mobile Bay and into Pass Christian on Mississippi’s Gulf Shore. I drove to a seafood restaurant for takeout. Inside it was packed no one but the servers wearing masks. People smiled at me in my N-95 bemused almost pitying as if I were the clueless one. I grabbed the foam takeout boxes and headed back to my family. Five more days.

We crossed the Mississippi in a hard rain spanned bridges over vast estuaries passing New Orleans and Baton Rouge and through the bowels of a fossil fuel economy: gas flares petroleum tank farms tankers loading oil for China and the Far East.

‘Don’t leave any of those California ideas around here’

On day 14 we were driving through pale green hills spotted with mesquite and cherry laurel into cutesy charming Fredericksburg Texas: lined with coffee shops candy sellers Hill Country wineries barbecue joints and plenty of places to get schnitzel. And many big red Trump signs which nearly two weeks after the inauguration remained standing. A battered hand-painted panel truck read cryptically “Trump Promises Kept.”

Outside of town a rancher in a Trump hat — our Airbnb host — pointed to our guest cottage on the plain. I went online to teach my USC class while Andrea went out with Wyatt who was in the white Stetson Andrea had found him in Tombstone for their adventures with the ranch puppies goats and donkeys. When they came back Andrea told me about a conversation she had.

“Where y’all from?” the Trump-hat rancher asked Andrea.

“California but don’t hold it against us” Andrea half-joked.

“That’s OK” he drawled. “Long as you don’t leave any of those California ideas around here.”

On day 15 at a tiny crossroads we ordered warm apple cobbler and bought the local paper. “Rancher indicted for theft of neighbor’s cow” read the headline. Not quite the same news that was making headlines around the country: A new administration impeachment Covid-19 surges.

Getting closer to home

Under a vast blue sky the rivers gave way to narrow creeks then dry washes. Down an arrow-straight road we passed the derricks pumping jacks and man camps of the West Texas oil patch then crossed into New Mexico. Tiny yuccas sprouted at the roadsides reminding us of our beloved Joshua trees of California. Yes getting closer.

As we drove Wyatt lost the signal of his fifth-grade Zoom class. He built a pillow fort for Rascal set his iPad to “Dog TV” and to relax him recited Edgar Allan Poe:

“Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted …tell me—tell me I implore!”

Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

Rascal listened politely. Tucson our last stay before home was two hours away.

On the morning of day 18 everyone was excited. “We’re going to actually be HOME today!” Wyatt exclaimed as we packed our things in our last Airbnb. Soon no more strangers’ beds no more takeout meals no more checking the tires oil coolant filling the tank or Googling the NPR frequency in Miami Mobile Baton Rouge Houston El Paso. And no more damn Red Bull. “I swear I’m never going to have another Red Bull as long as I live” Andrea said.

We got on the road for one last day. From the Saguaro cactus forest of the Tucson Mountains west to Picacho Peak then Phoenix endless Phoenix. We pushed through and the harsh yellow light of the Mohave Desert at midday. We were a hundred miles from California. Andrea put on John Denver. “Country roads take me home to the place I belong …” we sang together.

Now the exit to Joshua Tree and snow on the mountain at Idyllwild. So close.

It felt momentous. At the height of a deadly pandemic we’d traveled 6000 miles across a bruised and beautiful land encountering constant reminders of our political divisions but just as often signs of renewal. For that Andrea and I needed only to glance over our shoulders into the back seat. “One more hour!” Wyatt cried nearly bouncing through his seat belt.

Now finally we took California State Route 2 to our exit.

We rolled down the windows passed the long green expanse of Verdugo Park turned left into our wooded hills. We were alert our faces bright eyes wide. I took it slow. By now Rascal could smell where we were. He jumped on my lap as I drove perched his front paws at the base of the driver’s window mouth open in a smile tail wagging furiously.

“We’re home Rascal” Andrea said.

And so we were.

To Brianna Harness they're the great-grandparents who hired a bunch of pretend princesses and threw her a big birthday party when she was a toddler.

""Growing up it was pretty normal ... We had our own struggles our own problems. And with Waylon passing away when I was two three years old I don't have too much of a memory of him -- I just have like a whole bunch of pictures"" says Harness now in her early 20s. She's the daughter of country rapper Struggle Jennings (given name: William Harness) himself the son of Jennifer Eddy who is the daughter of Colter and her first husband Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist Duane Eddy.

For those keeping score at home that means Waylon Jennings is Harness' step-great-grandfather and that she's also related to musician and producer Shooter Jennings the son of Colter and the elder Jennings. In Nashville where everyone has some sort of connection to the industry though it never seemed like anything to brag about.

""As I've gotten older and the more I've gotten into music I feel like they definitely set huge stepping stones and paved the way for me"" Harness reflects. ""A lot of artists don't really have that privilege ... but it also set high standards -- very high standards -- with where I was supposed to go and what I'm supposed to do with my music and how I'm supposed to sound.""

Harness recalls herself as an ""extremely musical"" child -- she sang in the choir was first chair in band and ""just like ran around singing all the time"" -- but her debut album Welcome to My Nightmare only just arrived in 2020. She dreamed of being a forensic scientist then considered a few other career paths; music as her life's work wasn't a given.

""It's such a tough industry you know? There's so many artists out there and it's such a battle to really get your name out there and get your music heard and a very expensive process as well"" Harness explains. ""But now that I'm here I love it. I love it so much. I couldn't see myself really doing anything else.""

Harness' own musical tastes span decades and genres and she admits that she's ""still figuring out"" her full artistic spectrum. ""I kind of plan to be all over the place you know? ... With streaming platforms and the way everything's set up I feel like you're really allowed to just completely be yourself"" she reasons.

On Welcome to My Nightmare which follows an EP of duets with her father the artist is a little bit Amy Winehouse and a little bit Billie Eilish: There's a dark undercurrent to her beautiful aching vocals for example on her cover of Colter's 2006 album cut ""The Canyon.""

Beyond her Colter cover Harness' tracklist contains songs written by her father and grandmother -- additional opportunities to leverage her family's talent. Harness and her dad haven't always had a picture-perfect relationship: During some of Harness' childhood Struggle Jennings was in jail; her mother meanwhile struggled with drugs causing the singer to leave home at 15. Nonetheless she calls her father her ""best friend"" someone who can effortlessly channel her feelings and personality into lyrics.

""He just put himself in my perspective ... and it was just -- it's beautiful"" Harness says. ""We don't really like hold onto any past grudges or anything like that -- we're just here to create with each other ...

""There's probably not very many things that we don't know about each other"" she adds. ""There was so many times where I was like 'Oh I could see this going this way' ... and he was just like 'Oh what about this?' And I'm like 'Wow that's insane I didn't even know I felt like that and now you've given me these lyrics.'""

Although it's not on her album Harness' sessions for Welcome to My Nightmare also included a reimagining of Struggle Jennings' ""Outlaw S--t"" which itself pulls from Waylon Jennings' posthumously released song of the same name an altered version of his 1978 release ""Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out of Hand."" She alters the lyrics ever so slightly to sing the story of his drug crimes sentencing and jail time from her point of view.

Harness recorded ""Outlaw S--t"" and created its accompanying music video as a Father's Day gift. It was a longtime dream of hers to cover the song but nonetheless she cried through the whole process she says and sharing it with her father was just as emotional.

""He watched it and just started crying and oh it was a big thing"" she remembers. ""We've got that on film.""

It's common for generations of family members to connect through music but for Harness it's an extra-special experience since they're the ones making it.

""It's so much fun just sharing your feelings and emotions with your family. And music is just such a beautiful thing"" she says. ""We can all relate to it and all connect with each other through music.""",,,,,,
D,Dominion Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzAyLzIxLzMtY2hlYXAtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1zdG9ja3MtdG8tYnV5LW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Cheap Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now,"From dividends to favorable growth prospects this basket of inexpensive solar and wind stocks has it all.

Renewable energy remains red-hot even after a scorching 2020 where renewables trounced the broader market's gains. From small pure-play wind and solar stocks to large companies looking to diversify their revenue mix now seems to be a great time to look for premium renewable energy stocks. But there's a problem. Many of the industry's leading companies are now trading near record highs -- which can be off-putting for investors looking for a lower entry point.

With that we asked some of our contributors which renewable energy stocks they thought were cheap now. They came up with American Electric Power (AEP 1.19%) Dominion Energy (D 1.38%) and Hubbell (HUBB 1.30%).

Power your portfolio with a utility player

Scott Levine (American Electric Power): While politicians debate the role that green energy has played in the Texas power outages smart investors recognize that the political wrangling doesn't detract from the fact that renewable energy stocks represent significant growth opportunities. The challenge for clean-energy-minded investors though is where to turn. Although solar wind and geothermal stocks all represent viable options from which investors can choose American Electric Power (AEP) provides a less obvious approach. And fortunately for investors they can currently find shares in the bargain bin.

Branding itself as ""the premier regulated energy company"" AEP has a presence in 11 states and provides electricity to about 5.5 million customers making it one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States. Management has articulated a clear commitment to environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) values. For example the company is targeting a 42% reduction in its coal capacity by 2030 and it plans on supplanting this in part with ample green energy additions. Over the next 10 years AEP expects to add 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power to its power portfolio and 4.2 GW of wind power.

Unlike the majority of renewable energy stocks that don't reward shareholders by way of a dividend AEP has demonstrated consistent interest in returning capital to investors. Over the past decade AEP -- currently offering investors an attractive 3.8% dividend yield on its stock -- has steadily raised its distribution and it seems intent on continuing that trend.

Management expects to return $2.96 per share to investors in 2021 -- about 4.2% more than it dished out in 2020. Allaying concerns that the company is jeopardizing its financial well-being to please investors with the dividend management has targeted a payout ratio of 60% to 70% -- a range that seems reasonable considering the company's average payout ratio over the past three years has been 62%.

Currently shares of AEP appear attractively priced from a couple of different angles. For one the stock is trading at 20.3 times earnings representing a discount to its five-year average multiple of 27.3. Similarly the stock is trading at 2.6 times sales. While this is slightly higher than its five-year average ratio of 2.4 the valuation is still reasonable considering the S&P 500 P/S ratio is 2.9.

Transitioning from natural gas to renewables

Daniel Foelber (Dominion Energy): Dominion energy is the latest utility stock to launch an aggressive push into renewable energy. The company is a leading energy provider in Utah Ohio Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina. Although Dominion's portfolio is still mostly fossil fuels it has done a good job of moving away from coal toward natural gas over the past 15 years. Its sale of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and other gas transmission and distribution assets to Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway last year marked the first major step in its push to transition away from gas and toward renewables.

That push accelerated further when the company reported fourth-quarter results. Bigger than the numbers themselves was the company's brand new $32 billion five-year capital spending program 52% of which is devoted toward zero-carbon through offshore wind solar energy storage and nuclear relicensing. Offshore wind in particular is a big catalyst for Dominion's growth led by the company's 2.6 GW megaproject that is expected to go into service in 2024.

Impressively enough Dominion is confident that even with the hefty spending plan it will be able to grow earnings per share by at least 6.5% over the next five years. This forecast should be fairly accurate considering 88% of Dominion's existing portfolio is state-regulated. The company also plans to grow its dividend at 6% over the long term. In an effort to fund its renewable aspirations Dominion cut its quarterly dividend from $0.94 per share to $0.63 in December of last year. Even with the cut Dominion yields an impressive 3.5% -- much higher than the current market average of 1.5%.

Given the company's strong existing portfolio aggressive and profitable renewable investments and the fact that shares are on sale for 20% less than a year ago Dominion looks to be a worthwhile renewable energy stock to buy now.

Renewable energy provides growth for Hubbell

Lee Samaha (Hubbell): The words ""cheap"" and ""renewable energy stock"" don't often fit together these days. Therefore if you are looking for a value option you will have to think outside the box or rather outside the sweep of a wind power turbine.

In this context what about buying a highly cash generative value stock with some exposure to renewable energy related spending? That's where electrical and electronic products company Hubbell comes into play. If you are going to have investment in renewable energy farms you are going to need investment in the transmission and distribution (T&D) network as well.

Hubbell's exposure comes through its utility solutions segment responsible for 57% of adjusted operating profit in 2020 with electrical solutions making up the rest. Commenting on the fourth-quarter performance on the earnings release CEO Gerben Bakker said ""In the fourth quarter utility facing markets remained resilient with grid modernization and renewable energy trends driving ongoing strength in demand for T&D components and mid single digit growth in Power Systems.""

Looking ahead management expects its utility T&D components end market to grow 2% to 4% and utility communications and controls to grow 4% to 6%. Coupled with a recovery in the electrical solutions end market management expects Hubbell's sales to grow 6% to 8% with organic sales up 3% to 5%. Management's guidance implies around $495 million in free cash flow (FCF) putting Hubbell on a forward price-to-FCF multiple of 18.5 times.

That's a good value particularly if growth in spending on utility T&D will support mid-single-digit revenue growth over the medium term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2Rpc3BhdGNoL25hbWUvbWlsdG9uLXdvb2RsaWVmLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTU0MzQ4MjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milton Woodlief Obituary (2021) - Bon Air VA - Richmond Times-Dispatch,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/timesdispatch/name/milton-woodlief-obituary?id=5434828 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2Rpc3BhdGNoL25hbWUvbWlsdG9uLXdvb2RsaWVmLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTU0MzQ4MjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

JOLIET IL — A 27-year-old Joliet man was arrested in Kankakee County this weekend in connection with the January armed robbery of the Domino's Pizza on Joliet's Collins Street.

During the crime the gunman fired one shot in the direction of the Domino's employees. No one was hit Joliet police say. On Saturday Joliet police announced the capture of Jaelyn Gant who is charged in Will County with two counts of armed robbery being an armed habitual criminal and two counts of unlawful possession of a weapon by a convicted felon.

The Joliet robbery happened shortly before 2 p.m. on Jan. 14. A man entered the Domino's demanding money and displaying a gun. While fleeing the robber fired one gunshot at the Domino's employees Joliet police said.

In the days ahead Joliet police determined that Gant was the culprit and the Will County State's Attorney's Office authorized charges on Feb. 5 police said. A Will County judge recently issued a warrant for Gant's arrest and set bail at $1 million.

On Friday Joliet police learned the Bradley Police Department arrested Gant and he remains in the Kankakee County Jail awaiting his return to Will County. A current mugshot of Gant was not immediately available Saturday.

In 2014 Joliet Patch ran a story on Gant headlined""Joliet Man Charged With Crest Hill Shooting.""

The Noid wears a red bunny-eared bodysuit with an ""N"" on its chest and he's a physical manifestation of all of the barriers to delivering a pizza quickly. This little weirdo was all over in the '80s and '90s from commercials to video games to Michael Jackson's anthology film Moonwalker.

Domino's Pizza Success Story

The Noid was part of Domino's rise to fame but there's more to the story with this Domino's Pizza mascot. In 1960 the Monaghan brothers bought a struggling pizza shop DomiNick's for nine hundred dollars. After a year with no success James left the pizza business and Tom Monaghan was left with the failing shop. A few years later DomiNick's became one of the busiest pizza shops in the country!

Tom Monaghan attributed his success to ""keeping things simple."" In 1965 the thriving pizza shop changed its name to Dominos the pizza chain we all know and love. By 1983 the shop had opened 1000 pizza stores! To continue distinguishing themselves as the best pizza shop around Domino's instated a policy of delivering pizzas in thirty minutes or less.

Avoid the Noid

https://www.instagram.com/p/B-xy5_flrhA/

To spread the word about Domino's new fleet-footed pizza deliveries they created a new marketing campaign which is when ""Noid"" arrived on the scene. Noid was created in 1986 by Domino's Pizza's advertising agency Group 243. Group 243 hired Will Vinton Studios to sketch the Noid and make the commercials. Noid represented the struggles of delivering a pizza in 30 minutes. He always tried his best to overcome his many obstacles.

Commercials involving Noid employed the slogan ""Avoid the Noid."" The advertising campaign even created a computer game called Avoid the Noid in which characters did their best to deliver a pizza in 30 minutes in an apartment building full of Noids. Some of the Noids had water balloons or missiles to help them thwart the pizza delivery. A year later a different video game Yo! Noid was released for the NES.

An Unexpected Repercussion

Domino's was thrilled with the popularity and success of the Noid advertising campaign until one day in 1989. On January 30 22-year-old mentally ill Kenneth Lamar Noid entered a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Chamblee Georgia holding a .357 Magnum. Noid thought the ad campaign was a personal attack on him so he held two employees hostage in the Domino's for over five hours. He told the Domino's employees that owner Tom Monaghan had stolen his name and then he forced them to call Domino's headquarters and demand $100000 and a white limousine for his getaway.

He also requested a copy of The Widow's Son offering to exchange one hostage for it but he then reneged on the offer. Noid became hungry after a few hours and demanded that the Domino's hostages make him two special pizzas. As he ate them the hostages were able to escape. Soon after Noid surrendered to the police. The police reported that Noid had been ""having an ongoing feud in his mind with the owner of Domino's Pizza about the 'Noid' commercials."" He believed that the campaign ad was designed to mock him telling people to avoid him.

Noid was charged with aggravated assault extortion kidnapping and possession of a firearm during a crime. However he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was then sent to a mental institution. Domino's thought the storm had passed and continued to use the Noid for ridiculous commercials to advertise their speedy service. Unfortunately in 1995 Kenneth Lamar Noid committed suicide in his apartment still under the impression that Domino's Pizza was targeting him. Domino's Pizza immediately stopped using Noid in their ad campaign.

The Return of the Noid

The Noid has been brought back bit by bit in the last decade but he hasn't risen to his previous prominence. In 2009 Domino's Pizza created 1000 T-shirts which featured the Noid. Along with this the mascot's 25th birthday was celebrated with the video game The Noid's Super Pizza Shootout a tribute to Avoid the Noid.

The Noid continues to make subtle appearances showing up as a pinball machine character in 2016 and making an appearance in some Domino's commercials in 2016 and 2017. Although the Noid helped Domino's Pizza to become what it is today it's hard to forget his checkered past.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3dlZWstYXNpYS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMjI0ODAvbGFvcy1sZWFkZXJzLWZlYXItZG9taW5vLWVmZmVjdC10aGFpbGFuZHMtcHJvLWRlbW9jcmFjeS1tb3ZlbWVudNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3dlZWstYXNpYS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMjI0ODAvbGFvcy1sZWFkZXJzLWZlYXItZG9taW5vLWVmZmVjdC10aGFpbGFuZHMtcHJvLWRlbW9jcmFjeS1tb3ZlbWVudA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laos leaders fear ‘domino effect’ of Thailand protests amid election,"Young and middle-aged candidates will feature prominently during the election “as the government encourages the younger generation to take more roles in state posts” the Laotian Times reported adding that only 43 members of the current legislature would be standing for re-election.

According to the Vientiane Times more than 7200 polling stations are being set up across Laos and voting cards and ballot boxes have been produced and prepared for the election which is held once in five years.

According to Laos’ National Election Committee among the 224 candidates listed for the general election 164 will be selected as national assembly members by 4.3 million voters across the country.

Laos will hold its general election on Sunday to select members of the national assembly and provincial parliaments and while no surprises are expected in the one-party communist state analysts said authorities in the Southeast Asian country are increasingly concerned about the spillover effects of the protests in neighbouring Thailand on its own younger citizens.

Almost half of the candidates are aged 46 to 55 another 33 are under the age of 46 76 are aged 56 to 60 and 12 are older than 60 the newspaper said.

Local media reports said campaigning had “intensified” though these appeared to consist largely of candidates meeting voters to explain the importance of the election while encouraging them to vote and pledging that they would serve voters’ interests.

‘SHAM’ ELECTION?

Keith Barney a senior lecturer with the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University said candidates were closely vetted and winners approved by the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party (LPRP).

During the 2016 elections the International Federation of Human Rights described the polls as “a sham” because the LPRP is the only political party permitted in the country.

The LPRP which has ruled the country since 1975 obtained 144 of 149 total seats in 2016 with the remaining going to independent candidates.

The government that will be ‘elected’ by the National Assembly has already been determined by the party. So the entire process is a sham Martin Stuart-Fox emeritus history professor

Agreeing Martin Stuart-Fox emeritus history professor from the University of Queensland said elections were “predetermined” and choreographed by the LPRP “from start to finish”.

“The overwhelming majority of candidates are party members there are no other parties and the few independents are vetted by the party. The government that will be ‘elected’ by the National Assembly has already been determined by the party” he said. “So the entire process is a sham.”

Soulatha Sayalath an independent researcher based in Japan said the elections were held to give the impression that the LPRP was more “responsive to democracy than the Party wants to be governed by it”.

“The significance of the elections is that they allow the Party to educate the people that the country is heading towards people’s democratic regime” he said.

He added that the 11th Party Congress held last month was politically more important as it elected elite cadres to Party Central Committee which in turn elects Politburo members “who have real power to decide which direction the country is heading”.

“In other words the February elections are tools for building a sense among the people that the Party is responsive to visual democracy” Sayalath added.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER

However Barney said there was a regular degree of turnover of parliamentarians some of whom responded to social economic and environmental issues.

“So a limited amount of competition among party-approved candidates is permitted” Barney said adding that the main item to watch would be the announcement of the government particularly the president and prime minister.

Since 2001 the party’s secretary general usually becomes president so Thongloun Sisoulith looks set to follow this path Barney said.

Current vice-president and No 2 in the party Phankham Viphavanh is widely tipped to become the next prime minister although deputy prime minister Sonexay Siphandone could be another possibility Barney said.

“But it is possible that Laos could split the role of secretary general and president” said Barney pointing to the example of how it had done so in the 1990s.

In post-war Lao history the party’s secretary general has also served as either the state president or the prime minister. “So there is a degree of flexibility on these issues depending on the circumstances” Barney said.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions electoral events are expected to be scaled down as compared to past elections while authorities are likely to step up security at polling stations counting centres and election committee offices said private security services company GardaWorld last week.

It also added that “while unlikely” activists opposing the central government could stage rallies near these venues while clashes between security forces and protesters or between rival supporters were possible.

“Mass arrests may occur if officials consider any gathering participant to violate Covid-19 rules” GardaWorld said.

SPILLOVER EFFECT FROM THAILAND

Pavin Chachavalpongpun a professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University said Laotian authorities were increasingly concerned that protests in neighbouring Thailand and Myanmar would have a spillover effect on Laos.

Last October demonstrations in Thailand led to rare expressions of solidarity with protesters in Bangkok among Laotian netizens who launched a hashtag campaign “if Lao politics was good” on Twitter.

Young Laotians took the rare move of pointing out the shortcomings in their country ranging from the lack of democracy and free speech to the growing income gap high rates of illiteracy and devastation of Laos’ natural resources.

Some even asked for Laos’ inclusion in the #MilkTeaAlliance  a movement pushing for democratic change in Thailand Taiwan Hong Kong and in recent weeks Myanmar where citizens have protested over the military’s takeover of power from the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.

However signs of dissent do not appear to be widespread in the landlocked country due to close surveillance by Vientiane which does not tolerate opposition and has often inflicted hefty prison terms on dissenters. Rights campaigners say government critics have disappeared such as activist Od Sayavong who reportedly fled to Thailand.

Pavin said there was a sort of cross-border solidarity going on especially between Thai and Myanmar protesters and there was little doubt that “Lao authorities may fear that what has happened in Thailand (and Myanmar) could instigate unrest in their own countries”.

“People talked about the ‘domino theory’ during the Cold War. But this theory has returned with the domino of democracy which could inspire protesters in these countries to give themselves support and set up a kind of alliance” said Pavin.

A source from Laos who did not want to be named said that if the political unrest or instability in Myanmar dragged on the Laotian government might be forced to express positions or support within the Asean framework. “Otherwise it will have to bear some sort of economic consequences. Laos has relative high economic linkages in terms of trade and foreign direct investment” the source said.

In 2019 the Lao government said domestic and foreign investment that year would increase to over US$2.7 billion equivalent to 14 per cent of its GDP.

ECONOMIC AND PANDEMIC CHALLENGES

Sithanonxay Suvannaphakdy lead economic affairs researcher at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute said Laos’ election would have a limited impact on its socio-economic development as elected representatives had been unable to respond to the needs of the people “due in part to their limited power and limitation of state budget”.

“The key challenge for the administration now is the decline of global investments due to the pandemic” Suvannaphakdy said.

Given party secretary general Sisoulith’s advocacy for regulatory and procedural reforms to facilitate trade and investment over the past five years Suvannaphakdy said a more conducive business environment that fosters the growth of domestic enterprises and attracts more foreign investors is likely to be put in place over the next few years.

Suvannaphakdy added that even though the Covid-19 pandemic was well controlled in Laos a sustained revival of economic activities requires a successful containment of the outbreak both within and outside the country.

Since Laos announced its first two coronavirus infections in March last year the country with a 7.1 million population has recorded a total of 45 cases and no deaths.

“The persistent outbreak of Covid-19 in its key trading partners such as Thailand and in the rest of the world coupled with the emergence of the fast-spreading variant could reduce the regional and global demand for goods and services from Laos and hence could weaken its economic recovery in 2021” Suvannaphakdy said.

In its five-year socio-economic plan unveiled last month Vientiane said it hoped to grow at 4 per cent annually until 2025 mainly through maintaining growth infrastructural improvements and encouraging domestic and foreign investors to carry out large-scale projects.

The country is eyeing an annual average per capita income of US$2887 in 2025 up from its current US$2500. In contrast Thailand’s current per capita income stands at US$6450.

One of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia  the majority of Laos’ population depends on agriculture mostly growing rice. The World Bank said that the Covid-19 pandemic had plunged the economy into its first recession since the Asian financial crisis in 1998 with an estimated 0.6 per cent contraction in 2020.

But growth is expected to rebound to 4.9 per cent this year the Bank said assuming that Covid-19 is brought under control the government’s fiscal support measures are implemented effectively and that there are no new interruptions to global economy recovery.

However analysts said that given how Covid-19 has affected important sectors such as tourism the 4 per cent seems unrealistic for now.

They added that Vientiane was falling into a debt trap as a result of Chinese infrastructure investments connected to the Belt and Road Initiative  including the building of the Laos-China railway and hydropower dams on the mainstream and tributaries of the Mekong River.

There are also concerns that Laos will be drawn further into China’s orbit given that the Southeast Asian country has a wealth of natural resources that Beijing hopes to extract from to fuel its economic growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2xwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdmlkZW8tc2hvd3MtY2Fycy1jcmFzaGVkLWRvbWlub3MtNTAyODYwNNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2xwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdmlkZW8tc2hvd3MtY2Fycy1jcmFzaGVkLWRvbWlub3MtNTAyODYwNC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video shows car crashed into Dominos Pizza on Gloucester Road in Bristol,"The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel

DOW,Dow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW1pZGppcGlvbmVlci5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2FydHMtYW5kLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvaW5kaWdlbm91cy1hcnRpc3QtYnJpYW4tZG93LWZpbmRzLXN1Y2Nlc3MtcGFpbnRpbmctZm9yLXRoZS1wZW9wbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indigenous artist Brian Dow finds success 'painting for the people',"BEMIDJI -- When Brian Dow was starting out as an artist he tried to sell his paintings in the Walmart parking lot to make ends meet. Passersby laughed at him.

“There are hundreds of times that I wanted to give up” Dow said. “I told myself ‘I’m going to prove to these people that I’m going to make it’ because they laughed at me. I thought while you go to work 8 to 4:30 (and) you don’t like your job I’m doing what I like to do.”

Their laughter didn’t dissuade him it instead fueled him to press on. Now a mere seven years later some of his paintings have sold for five-figure prices and earlier this month one of his designs was sported by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. in the Congressional House Chamber in Washington D.C.

Dow originally from Ponemah in Red Lake came from humble beginnings and has earned a respected and well-known name for himself as a visual artist.

Picking up a paintbrush

Dow never pictured himself where he is now. A few years ago he was working as a custodian and housekeeper at the Palace Casino Hotel in Cass Lake living paycheck to paycheck. One day he just knew he had to make a change.

“I told myself ‘Okay we’ve gotta do something different what is it going to be?’” Dow said.

He began writing a manuscript but soon realized how long writing a book takes and turned to sketching using white charcoal pencil on black graphite paper. Soon after he began to paint.

“I was afraid to pick up the paintbrush” Dow said. “It was hard but when I made my first painting I said ‘Wow look at that look what I did.’”

Then he started sharing his paintings with the world.

Dow remembers the exact day his career started: Jan. 14 2014. That was the day he officially decided he was going to be an artist.

It was also when he first sold two of his paintings within a week to women in Colorado and California for nearly $500 apiece and realized that art might be a realistic career path for him.

“That’s where I realized that there’s money to be made in art” he remarked.

And where Dow began as a custodian now one of his paintings hangs in the casino’s lobby.

He didn’t have formal training or a background in art like many he was interested in drawing and art growing up but didn’t take it further until he reached adulthood. Dow took a year of classes at Leech Lake Tribal College where art instructor Dewey Goodwin served as a mentor for him.

Evolving style

Though he has only been working as an artist for a few years Dow’s style has significantly evolved during that time.

So has his confidence.

“As a beginning artist I didn’t sign my work. I didn’t think anyone would want my name on their wall” Dow said. That has quickly changed.

Dow describes his work as “(painting) my culture on canvas from old chiefs to the present day with stories.” Motifs of Turtle Island traditional dancers and Ojibwe florals are omnipresent throughout Dow’s work.

He started with many silhouettes of Native American imagery. He then moved to more colorful designs and lately has been experimenting with Ojibwe florals.

Dow said the floral designs represent the Ojibwe culture and “allow other tribal members from different tribes to recognize that you are Indigenous people from the woodlands area” when on pow wow circuits.

The designs are Dow’s interpretation of old Ojibwe floral patterns continuing a tradition of keeping a legacy alive for years to come.

“Before I started painting these old Ojibwe floral designs I had asked an elder beader whom I met at my first vending show if it was okay for me to paint these designs from long ago” Dow said. “He told me to paint what I feel. ‘Don't bother what people will say about who you are and what you paint. You are here to paint for the people.’""

Dow said he crafted his floral designs respectfully doing lots of research in recreating them.

“To many it is medicine. If I can make something that many people love that's medicine for them. I am just here to provide that for them if they want to hang a painting in their home or office or even wearing my artwork” he said. “I've finally created something that thousands of people love throughout Turtle Island and I appreciate that.”

The meaning behind much of his work is rooted in Ojibwe values. One of his most prestigious hanging paintings resides in the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis. This painting depicts the Anishinaabe creation story.

Wearable art

In recent months more people have seen Dow’s work than ever before. He began collaborating with Kevin Johnson of myBemidji and printing some of his designs on face masks.

Dow is proudest of one of his latest series of paintings -- a set of three Ojibwe floral designs on black backgrounds -- which he made during Indigenous Peoples’ Week. These are featured heavily on masks and shirts.

“I made them into hoodies and shirts and masks and they all sold out very quickly. Thankfully the people loved these designs” he said. “My first hoodie order sold out within 36 hours.”

His first shipment of masks sold out in less than a day.

Dow currently does all of his painting in his Bemidji apartment. Looking around the wall of his apartment at some of his prints and originals he said “this is just a fraction of what I have made during my seven years of being an artist. There’s a lot of work out there that I never photographed.”

Dow said Johnson of myBemidji contacted him in December wanting to work with an Indigenous artist.

“We worked together as a collaboration so my work will be sold in his new shop” he said. “It’s a good partnership there.”

Dow said he was also thankful for the collaboration with Jason Schoning of Happy 420 Merch in downtown Bemidji who has worked with him on the rollout of his hoodies.

In the time before COVID-19 Dow sold his work at pow wows fairs art shows and more. Now since COVID his work has exploded on social media.

“That’s where I get all my sales from is social media” he said. He described it as a “chain reaction” as when one person sees his design on a hoodie and tells someone else about it he reaches a further audience than he could’ve imagined.

On display for thousands

You don’t have to look far to see Dow’s work.

It hangs in medical complexes tribal colleges tribal council buildings elementary and high schools Bemidji State University drug and rehabilitation facilities casinos a local juvenile center on clothing and most notably the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis.

Dow has also painted billboards in Red Lake and at the Red Lake Nation borders and has completed murals at the Minnesota Indian Women’s Resource Center in Minneapolis and Thief River Falls Seven Clans Casino Indoor Waterpark.

“I can say that thousands and thousands of people have some of my work” Dow said noting that he has sold paintings to people in more than 40 states.

Along with the thousands of people who own a piece of his artwork and clothing even more have seen it in the past few weeks all around the world.

Recently one of Dow’s masks was gifted to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar during a visit she made to the area in late January. She wore the mask which was printed with Dow’s tobacco leaf design to speak in front of Congress. Dow was unaware of this until he started getting tagged in photos on Facebook and saw a photo of Omar wearing it while on the House floor.

Now more photos of Omar have been publicized wearing the mask in the Star Tribune and even The Guardian  which is based in London.

Dow was initially surprised and a bit conflicted as he doesn’t consider himself a political person and wasn’t quite sure how to feel about it. Now he is thankful for the light it is shedding on his work.

“When I saw this on the Congress floor I was happy I didn’t lose my humbleness about it” he said. “My artwork is not politically based my artwork is for everyone.”

Dow says he tries to stay humble generally not seeking publicity for his work as he feels he is doing what the Creator intended him to do.

He also ribbed that Omar was wearing her mask upside down but that it still looked nice.

What’s next?

When he began making art years ago Dow hoped it would serve as a way to support his family and give him purpose. He has found success in both and now has ambitions to open his own small business and online store.

In the more distant future Dow hopes to finish that book he started and pass on his knowledge to others. He said his 10-year goal is to be a better public speaker to “have a strong voice and let people hear it.”

His advice to other artists is “just don’t give up.”

Dow also hopes to hire some assistants in the future to help more with the printing and distribution of his work so he can get back to what he loves to do most: painting.

Meanwhile investors piled into economically sensitive names to bet on a comeback.

The broad equity benchmark lost 0.8% to 3876.50 in volatile trading falling for a fifth straight session amid the weakness in tech and consumer discretionary. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.5% to 13533.05 as Tesla shares slid 8.6%. Big Tech stocks came under pressure with Apple Amazon and Microsoft all dropping at least 2%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed a 200-point loss to close 27.37 points higher or 0.1% at 31521.69. A handful of economic comeback plays boosted the blue-chip benchmark. Disney jumped 4.4% while industrial giant Caterpillar and chemicals company Dow Inc. both climbed more than 3.5%. American Express and Chevron gained 3.2% and 2.7% respectively.

Some equity investors grew concerned about rapidly rising Treasury yields in recent weeks as they could especially hurt high-growth companies reliant on easy borrowing while diminishing the relative appeal of stocks. These same tech stocks also thrived during the pandemic so some investors may be taking profits and rotating into names that will do well in a recovery.

The 10-year Treasury yield rose again on Monday to around 1.35% after jumping 14 basis points last week to its highest level since February 2020. So far this month the benchmark rate has moved up 27 basis points. The 30-year yield touched a one-year high of 2.2% Monday. A basis point is 0.01%.

""This move in yields should be something that investors keep a close eye on"" Matt Maley chief market strategist at Miller Tabak said in a note. ""Just because long-term rates are ultra-low on an historical basis we do not believe that they will have to rise as far as most pundits think they do...before they impact the stock market.""

All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. His comments on rates and inflation could determine the market direction for the week.

On Monday European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in a speech that the central bank is ""closely monitoring the evolution of long-term nominal bond yields."" European sovereign bonds yields moved lower in response to her remarks.

Many on Wall Street still believe that the jump in bond yields reflects a sign of growing confidence in the economic recovery and stocks should be able to absorb higher rates amid strong earnings.

""We do not see the recent increase in yields as a threat to the bull market"" Keith Lerner chief market strategist at Truist said in a note. ""Given that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery monetary and fiscal policy remains supportive the sharp rebound in earnings and favorable relative valuations we maintain our overweight to equities.""

Monday's losses pared the Nasdaq's February gains to 3.5%. The S&P 500 is up 4.4% this month while the Dow has gained 5.1%.The small-cap Russell 2000 has outperformed with a 8.6% rally so far.

Airline stocks rebounded after Deutsche Bank upgraded several names in the industry to a buy rating. American Airlines jumped more than 9% on Monday.

On the pandemic front the White House said that it expects to ship out millions of delayed coronavirus vaccine doses this week after a sweeping winter storm disrupted logistics. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that a New York resident has tested positive for the Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa.

He began writing a manuscript but soon realized how long writing a book takes and turned to sketching using white charcoal pencil on black graphite paper. Soon after he began to paint.

“I was afraid to pick up the paintbrush” Dow said. “It was hard but when I made my first painting I said ‘Wow look at that; look what I did.’”

Then he started sharing his paintings with the world.

Dow remembers the exact day his career started: Jan. 14 2014. That was the day he officially decided he was going to be an artist.

It was also when he first sold two of his paintings within a week to women in Colorado and California for nearly $500 apiece and realized that art might be a realistic career path for him.

“That’s where I realized that there’s money to be made in art” he remarked.

One of his paintings hangs in the lobby of the casino where Dow once worked as a custodian.

He didn’t have formal training or a background in art. Though he was interested in drawing and art growing up he didn’t pursue it until he reached adulthood. Dow took a year of classes at Leech Lake Tribal College.

Evolving style

Though he has only been working as an artist for a few years Dow’s style has significantly evolved during that time.

So has his confidence.

“As a beginning artist I didn’t sign my work. I didn’t think anyone would want my name on their wall” Dow said.

Dow describes his work as “(painting) my culture on canvas from old chiefs to the present day with stories.” Motifs of Turtle Island traditional dancers and Ojibwe florals are omnipresent throughout Dow’s work.

He started with many silhouettes of Native American imagery. He then moved to more colorful designs and lately has been experimenting with Ojibwe florals.

Dow said the floral designs represent the Ojibwe culture and “allow other tribal members from different tribes to recognize that you are Indigenous people from the woodlands area” when on powwow circuits.

The designs are Dow’s interpretation of old Ojibwe floral patterns continuing a tradition of keeping a legacy alive for years to come.

“Before I started painting these old Ojibwe floral designs I had asked an elder beader whom I met at my first vending show if it was OK for me to paint these designs from long ago” Dow said. “He told me to paint what I feel. ‘Don't bother what people will say about who you are and what you paint. You are here to paint for the people.'""

Dow said he crafted his floral designs respectfully doing lots of research.

“To many it is medicine. If I can make something that many people love that's medicine for them. I am just here to provide that for them if they want to hang a painting in their home or office or even wearing my artwork” he said. “I've finally created something that thousands of people love throughout Turtle Island and I appreciate that.”

The meaning behind much of his work is rooted in Ojibwe values. One of his most prestigious hanging paintings resides in the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis. This painting depicts the Anishinaabe creation story.

Wearable art

Dow is proudest of one of his latest series of paintings — a set of three Ojibwe floral designs on black backgrounds — which he made during Indigenous Peoples’ Week. These are featured heavily on masks and shirts.

“I made them into hoodies and shirts and masks and they all sold out very quickly. Thankfully the people loved these designs” he said. “My first hoodie order sold out within 36 hours.”

His first shipment of masks sold out in less than a day.

Prior to the pandemic Dow sold his work at powwows fairs art shows and more. Now his work has exploded on social media.

“That’s where I get all my sales from is social media” he said.

On display for thousands

You don’t have to look far to see Dow’s work.

It hangs in medical complexes tribal colleges tribal council buildings elementary and high schools Bemidji State University drug and rehabilitation facilities casinos a local juvenile center on clothing and most notably the McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis.

Dow has also painted billboards in Red Lake and at the Red Lake Nation borders and has completed murals at the Minnesota Indian Women’s Resource Center in Minneapolis and Thief River Falls Seven Clans Casino Indoor Waterpark.

“I can say that thousands and thousands of people have some of my work” Dow said noting that he has sold paintings to people in more than 40 states.

Recently one of Dow’s masks was gifted to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar during a visit she made to the area in January. She wore the mask which was printed with Dow’s tobacco leaf design to speak in front of Congress. Dow was unaware of this until he started getting tagged in photos on Facebook.

Dow was initially surprised and a bit conflicted as he doesn’t consider himself a political person and wasn’t quite sure how to feel about it. Now he is thankful for the light it is shedding on his work.

“When I saw this on the Congress floor I was happy. I didn’t lose my humbleness about it” he said. “My artwork is not politically based — my artwork is for everyone.”

Dow says he tries to stay humble generally not seeking publicity for his work as he feels he is doing what the Creator intended him to do.

He also joked that Omar was wearing her mask upside down but that it still looked nice.

What’s next?

When he began making art years ago Dow hoped it would serve as a way to support his family and give him purpose. He has found success in both and now has ambitions to open his own small business and online store.

In the more distant future Dow hopes to finish that book he started and pass on his knowledge to others. He said his 10-year goal is to be a better public speaker to “have a strong voice and let people hear it.”

His advice to other artists? “Just don’t give up.”

Six Flags Entertainment Corporation says it is planning to open all 26 of its amusement parks and water parks for the 2021 season including five that were not able to operate last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The company said it worked with epidemiologists to develop a reopening plan that “meets or exceeds federal state and local guidelines for sanitization hygiene and social distancing protocols.”

Six Flags will limit the number of people in its parks and guests will have to make reservations before their visits. Masks will be required for all workers and guests and they will also have to pass temperature checks according to its website.

The company is also taking steps to encourage social distancing on rides in lines and seating areas and other areas around its parks.

Six Flags (SIX) is hiring thousands of workers to operate its rides restaurants and other attractions at its parks in the United States Mexico and Canada according to a news release.

“Our guests and team members are ready for the return of fun and signature Six Flags thrills in 2021” Bonnie Weber senior vice president of Park Operations said in the release. “Last year we set the standard for operating our parks safely and entertained millions of guests in adherence to government and CDC health guidelines at 21 of our 26 parks. We offered a local and outdoor entertainment venue spanning dozens to hundreds of acres where families and friends could safely spend time together.”

Weber said the company is working with state and local officials to set firm reopening dates for its parks in California Illinois Massachusetts Mexico City and Canada.

Six Flags Over Texas in Dallas-Fort Worth and Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio had already opened on weekends in February but had to close on Saturday and Sunday because of the devastating winter storm.

Many of the parks are set to open in the next few weeks though some of the water parks and parks in northern cities will open later in the Spring.

Only 4.6 million people visited the parks in the first nine months of 2020 – an 83% decrease from the 26.7 million who attended over the same period in 2019.

The company will release it’s fourth quarter and full year financial reports for 2020 on February 24.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbGVhdmUtaXQtdG8tYmVhdmVyLXJlYWwtbGlmZS1icm90aGVycy1pbnNwaXJlZC13YWxseS1iZWF2ZXIuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Leave It to Beaver': Real-Life Brothers Inspired Wally and Beaver Cleaver,"The co-creator of 'Leave It to Beaver' got the inspiration for Wally (Tony Dow) and Beaver Cleaver (Jerry Mathers) from his own sons.

Leave It to Beaver was all about the fictional Cleaver family. But real kids inspired the iconic TV show’s characters and storylines.

How Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers got cast on ‘Leave It to Beaver’

Leave It to Beaver centered around June (Barbara Billingsley) and Ward Cleaver (Hugh Beaumont) and their two sons Wally (Tony Dow) and Beaver (Jerry Mathers).

How did Dow and Mathers land the roles that would make their acting careers? Mathers showed up at his audition wearing his cub scout uniform. He had a meeting right after his Leave It to Beaver audition and he was anxious to get to it. The young actor told the casting agents so and they found it endearing.

As for Dow he ended up being cast as Wally after starring in a failed pilot. From 1957 to 1963 Dow and Mathers played TV brothers. It wasn’t until they were a little older they would forge a bond that became a lifelong friendship.

Kids of ‘Leave It to Beaver’ co-creator inspired Wally and Beaver

Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher created Leave It to Beaver. They wrote about things they knew which as fathers meant writing about kids. It was two of Connelly’s children according to the Los Angeles Times who inspired Wally and Beaver.

Connelly’s 14-year-old son Jay inspired Wally Beaver’s older brother. And his 8-year-old son Ricky served as the inspiration for Beaver. Ricky’s speaking habits were even reflected in Wally’s. And Beaver’s name? It came from a shipmate of Connelly’s in the merchant marines.

Wally and Beaver weren’t the only characters who were inspired by real people. Their friends namely the mischievous Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond) and Larry Mondello (Robert “Rusty” Stevens) were based on Ricky and Jay’s real-life friends.

Brian Levant who co-wrote Still the Beaver and executive produced The New Leave It to Beaver told the LA Times in 2003 Connelly used to jot down what kids would say and use it on the show.

“Joe used to be one of those guys who’d walk around with a pad of paper in his pocket and whenever a kid would say something funny he’d write it down” Levant said.

According to him on one occasion Ricky got up from the dinner table and told his dad he wouldn’t be providing him with any more material for Leave It to Beaver.

Is ‘Leave It to Beaver’ on Netflix?

Want to watch Leave It to Beaver on Netflix? The streaming giant doesn’t have the iconic sitcom. Instead episodes can be rented on Amazon Prime Video or Itunes for $1.99 each.

Those with NBC’s streaming service Peacock are in luck because they have every episode of Leave It to Beaver. All six seasons are streaming on Peacock at the time of publication. Watch Haskell telling June “You look lovely today Mrs. Cleaver” and see every chuckle-inducing scenario involving Wally and Beaver."

By Hans Qu · Published on February 21st 2021

This month Disney announced it will be closing Blue Sky Studios the 20th Century Fox animation division acquired during the 2019 takeover. The news drew immediate anger from the animation community especially because the studio had only ten months of production left for its next picture a feature-length adaptation of the fantasy webcomic Nimona. Further complicating the issue is the ever-looming presence of Disney’s rapidly encroaching monopoly over the entertainment and especially animation industries.

But today I’d like to celebrate the successes of Blue Sky Studios which for all its faults remained a force of animation to the end with outstanding art direction and a strong grasp on visual storytelling. The studio’s artists created work that was distinct and had great respect and love for the history of Western animation in particular. Let’s look back at the filmmaking of this once-great titan of animation.

Ice Age

By far Blue Sky Studios’ most financially successful endeavor Ice Age was released in 2002 in the early days of CG animation. With a “journey” structure and a buddy-cop bent the plot follows a trio of talking primitive mammals taking a human baby back to his early-human tribe. Revisited in 2021 this movie holds up shockingly well. The art direction especially the backgrounds and character design have an angular almost expressionist quality to them that helps disguise the limitations of 2002 CGI rendering technology.

Despite these limitations the characters still move fluidly and expressively in the film which is directed by studio co-founder Chris Wedge and co-directed by Carlos Saldanha. The character animation is superb especially considering the differences in the characters’ body types. Manny the wooly mammoth walks with a heavy deliberate gait that makes him feel like the biggest character in every scene. Diego the smilodon is lithe and light-footed. Sid the sloth is clumsy and bumbling.

And yet nowhere is a character more well-expressed than in Scrat the silent mascot of Blue Sky whose slapstick antics run underneath the rest of the film. Scrat is like a Warner Bros. character brought to the modern age. He has a single simple goal: get his acorn and store it for the winter. His pursuit of this goal leads him into situations of animated physical comedy that can be easily understood by anyone. Simple want simple character and simple comedy built on visuals with no need for dialogue.

This love for classic Western cartoons is present throughout all of the Ice Age films and indeed all of Blue Sky’s films even as the series begins to wear on and the writing begins to deteriorate. The key to the first film is motive: all three of the protagonists have different reasons for embarking on their journey together leading to a strong tension that builds up as they inch closer to their goal.

Subsequent installments of the Ice Age franchise — the first two of them directed by Saldanha alone — lack this conflict of interest leading to a rapidly expanding ensemble that never feels as genuine as the original trio. Nevertheless the series maintains its love for classic Western animation and slapstick comedy throughout its five films and multiple Scrat-themed shorts.

Robots (2005)

The second film from the studio — again directed by Wedge and co-directed by Saldanha — maintains the core strengths of the first: a distinct art style and expressive characters. The world of Robots has a 1950s technology aesthetic and the film is a visual delight as a result. Sequences of gadgets and machinery move with the same efficient precision that makes industrial documentary footage and Iron Man suit-up sequences so satisfying to watch.

The robot characters live in a robotic world that is filled to the brim with fun and strange visual comedy and the team at Blue Sky Studios mines it for everything it’s worth. But despite the comedic bent it’s a movie with a lot of heart and a good bit to say about consumerism classism and self-image in the modern age.

The movie’s primary weakness is its overreliance on Robin Williams as comic relief. Robots is funny enough on its own merits but the need to force in Williams’ character to make the most of the casting budget really drains dramatic tension especially in later scenes. Furthermore the morality tale does kind of fall flat when one recalls the Happy Meal tie-in and toys that this movie sold as part of its promotional campaign.

Despite that Robots doesn’t feel old. The art style makes the visuals hold up and the story’s relevance doesn’t seem to have aged a day. Like Ice Age there’s a solid understanding of how to set up and pay off physical comedy that draws from the history of cartoons like the Looney Tunes and MGM shorts. And of course the animation fundamentals are robust and expressive. Robots is a forgotten masterpiece.

Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who! (2008)

Blue Sky Studios’ second-best rated movie is an expanded Dr. Seuss adaption that like Illumination’s The Lorax four years later was tasked with taking a kindergarten reading level book of at most seventy-two pages and turning it into a full-length feature film. And yet Horton Hears A Who! really does work. The studio’s demonstrated excellence at physicality blends remarkably well with the Seussian aesthetic.

Robots art director Steve Martino was one of the directors of this picture (with former Pixar animator Jimmy Hayward) and he put the lessons he learned from that film into animating the bizarre architecture and strange machines that define the art of Dr. Seuss.

The author’s widow Audrey Geisel served as a supervising producer and allowed access to an archive of original drawings material from the 1953 musical feature and even memos to legendary animator Chuck Jones for the 1966 How The Grinch Stole Christmas TV special. Horton Hears A Who! really does look like a Dr. Seuss book brought to life right down to the font choices. Even some of the jokes are written to rhyme or be otherwise vaguely Seussical. The movie also features a few short but distinct moments where the animation style changes showcasing the filmmakers’ love for the medium.

Rio (2011)

Rio opens with a musical number with the energy of a Disney renaissance film. It is visually stunning and sets up a spectacular adventure that did pretty well critically and at the box office. But just one year prior Disney released Toy Story 3 and Tangled to an outstanding reception. And DreamWorks set their own new visual standard with How To Train Your Dragon. The turn of the decade saw animation as a whole trending toward what the technology could do to be more realistic and with that came a decreased interest in the style of exaggerated expression and animated acting that characterized Blue Sky Studios’ strongest work.

Competition aside Rio also suffers from its real-world setting. Blue Sky’s prior films distance themselves from reality and the suspension of disbelief that allows the audience to believe a mammoth and a saber-toothed cat can team up to bring a baby across hundreds of miles of frozen tundra is the same level of suspension of disbelief required to accept that some of the antics they get into wouldn’t kill them. By integrating real-world settings and concerns the slapstick becomes absurd.

Rio is further hampered by its reliance on celebrity stunt casting. This is something to which Blue Sky films were subject before but as the method is strained the flaws that were always there become more pronounced. And the 2014 sequel fails to fix any of these issues. Still both Rio films were helmed by Saldanha the first one being his first original IP in the director’s chair and his love for his hometown of Rio de Janeiro oozes from these movies in the visuals culture and atmosphere.

If So Jacksonville Could Offer A Glimpse Into The Future,"When Pete Wilking founded A1A Solar in Jacksonville in 2010 the rooftop solar industry was still in its infancy. Just three years later the company was “very financially viable.”

Then Jacksonville’s city-owned utility company changed its rooftop solar policy in 2018 reducing the amount it reimburses solar customers for excess power. That change doubled the amount of time it takes for solar owners to recoup their investment. Demand soured and Wilking was forced to lay off 25 people about half of his full time staff.

JEA says it changed the policy to keep regular customers from having to subsidize solar customers.

That’s an argument that has gained political traction around Florida recently although solar businesses and advocates say the small number of solar owners don’t have the impact utilities claim they do.

“When they’re making disingenuous statements I think we need to be sure to call that out” said Alissa Schafer a communications and research specialist for the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI) a national watchdog organization.

Schafer and others are worried that Florida’s powerful investor-owned utilities are pushing regulators to scale back the state’s rooftop solar policy as JEA did or get rid of it all together. If successful the rooftop solar industry across the Sunshine State could start to look a lot like it does in Jacksonville.

JEA’s downtown Jacksonville headquarters.

Net Metering

The Florida Legislature unanimously enacted a policy called net metering in 2008 requiring utility companies to reimburse or offset solar customers for excess energy generated. The state’s investor-owned utilities were required to offer one-for-one net metering meaning they had to reimburse solar owners at the same rate they charge other retail customers. City-owned utilities like JEA followed suit.

The policy helped solar grow in Florida by 10000% according to Solar United Neighbors (SUN) a national solar advocacy nonprofit although total numbers remained low.

Solar Energy Industries Association

When JEA lowered its net metering reimbursement rate from 10.3 cents per kilowatt hour to 3.25 cents existing solar owners were grandfathered in. But for new customers instead of the seven to nine years to recoup their investment on a solar system with a 35-year life the time increased to about 20 years said Wilking.

“That’s going to slow solar adoption” he said. “It’s going to slow clean energy and we’re going to still be more reliant on fossil fuels.”

TerraWise Homes a Jacksonville-based homebuilder also felt the effects of JEA’s solar policy change.

Initially nearly every home the company built had rooftop solar panels. Thanks to the available 26% federal tax credit a TerraWise home with solar was less expensive than one without.

“[S]ay adding the solar to your house is going to raise your mortgage by $65. But then you’re going to save $75 a month on your electricity bill. So your payback was virtually immediate” Director of Operations Jacob Shacter explained. “Mathematically it just made sense.”

But not after JEA changed its net metering policy.

“We went from basically 100% solar to none overnight” Shacter said.

JEA as a city-owned utility whose oversight comes from its board and City Council didn’t need outside approval for the net metering change. But the state’s investor-owned utilities are regulated by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) which sets the policy on net metering.

The PSC reaffirmed the state’s net metering rule in 2019 calling it an “effective” way to promote solar.

Not long after a freshman legislator asked the commission to review the policy again.

“Low and middle-income families are paying more on their electricity bills than they should so their wealthy neighbors can have solar panels on their rooftops” Rep. Lawrence McClure (R-Dover) wrote to the group citing a familiar argument.

In response the PSC held a workshop in September 2020 to discuss net metering in which the utilities argued that customers without rooftop solar were subsidizing those who had it.

The Cost Shift Argument

The state’s four major investor-owned utilities claim they’ve paid $39 million in “subsidies” for rooftop solar customers.

“For the average net metered customer the subsidy they enjoy is about $75 to $80 per month” said Terry Deason representing Florida Power and Light (FPL) Gulf Power Company and Tampa Electric Company (TECO).

He said the utilities project another $700 million in subsidies between 2020 and 2025 assuming rooftop solar adoption continues to grow significantly. While not advocating for a change in net metering at the meeting he did say “at some point it needs to be addressed.”

But EPI’s Schafer said those numbers don’t add up.

“The percentage of people that have solar on their business or on their home is so incredibly low it’s ridiculous to imply that this is causing a cost shift” she said.

Rooftop solar adoption statewide today is only at .5% or around 60000 customers. In Jacksonville the percentage is similar with 2106 residential and 104 commercial customers.

FPL Gulf Power TECO and Duke Energy have paid a total of $1193160 to net metering customers since 2008 according to documents the utilities submitted to the PSC last year. JEA has paid $250982.

A 2017 report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California found the effect of net metering reimbursements on retail prices to be “negligible for the foreseeable future.” New research from Michigan Tech University published this month suggests that homeowners with rooftop solar are actually subsidizing their neighbors who don’t have rooftop solar.

Solar United Neighbors was also impacted by JEA’s net metering change. They had to scrap plans for a rooftop solar cooperative in Jacksonville. A solar cooperative (or co-op) is a group of homeowners who come together to qualify for a bulk discount.

Alissa Schafer research and communications specialist at the Energy and Policy Institute.

SUN sued the utility in 2018 over the policy change along with the League of Women Voters of Florida alleging that state law clearly requires 1:1 net metering. JEA maintained the reimbursement is not specified.

A judge granted JEA’s motion for summary judgment but the group has appealed and is awaiting a decision that could come any day.

An attorney with Earthjustice the law firm representing SUN said there’s more than one way to change the net metering rule.

“If the legislature repealed the net metering requirement you would see many utilities push for a policy similar to JEA’s and as a result I think you would see solar installations by customers really plummet as you’re seeing in Jacksonville” said staff attorney Bradley Marshal.

No legislation has been filed as of yet for the March session although the deadline isn’t until February 26 2021. Even if nothing comes out of the legislative session a policy change could be sought through the PSC.

Follow The Money

Advocates also have been following campaign funding closely. EPI’s Schafer worries the flow of money might hint at what’s to come.

During the fall 2020 election cycle in Florida investor-owned utilities donated more than $9.2 million to candidates and their political committees on both sides of the aisle according to the EPI.

That’s far more than they’ve paid out to net metering customers since the rule was adopted in 2008 Schafer said.

“Florida utilities like Florida Power & Light have spent tens of millions of dollars to craft and preserve a political environment that delivers exactly what the power companies and their investors want from our city commissions all the way to our legislature and Public Service Commission” said Schafer.

And advocates like Schafer are watching more than just dollars; they’re also looking at political appointments.

Former legislator Michael La Rosa applied to be a member of the PSC in June and asThe Miami Heraldreports just days later he transferred $50000 from the political committee he controls Floridians for Opportunity to the fund used to elect Republicans to the state Senate — the body that would eventually confirm La Rosa’s appointment to the PSC. He was sworn in as the PSC’s newest member last month.

For most of its 130-year history the PSC was a three-person elected body. In 1978 it was expanded to a five-member appointed commission. Integrity Florida a nonprofit research institute and government watchdog has labeled the PCS a “captured” regulatory agency meaning state politicians have “considerable influence” on it.

Another notable recent change was at the Office of Public Counsel (OPC) which provides legal representation for residents in utility related matters. AsThe Tampa Bay Timesreported J.R. Kelly who was the head of that office for 14 years was effectively forced out last year when Sen. President Wilton Simpson — a top recipient of utility contributions with his political committee Jobs For Florida accepting $220000 — successfully pushed legislation to impose a 12-year term limit on the position.

In the past the OPC has viewed rooftop solar as an “important part” of Florida’s future energy mix. Kelly himself fell “somewhere in the middle” of current net-metering arguments meaning he supports reimbursement but not necessarily at the 1:1 ratio solar advocates want.

The position of Kelly’s successor Richard Gentry is not yet clear although he spent the last year lobbying for the utility-backed nonprofit Floridians for Government Accountability.

Florida’s Solar Future

Utility scale solar is expanding rapidly in Florida and across the country. JEA has installed 8 solar farms over the past decade and has plans to build five more. Once all of those are online they will produce enough renewable energy to power about 62000 Jacksonville homes or about 15% of JEA’s customers.

JEA declined to be interviewed for this article citing the ongoing litigation but said in an email they believe utility-scale solar is more cost efficient than rooftop.

But even with that rapid expansion scientists and environmental activists say it’s not nearly enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. So does JEA — which is under new management and a new board after a botched attempt to privatize — plan to reinstate 1:1 reimbursement for net metering customers?

“There are no plans to change the policy as it currently stands because it equitably spreads the associated costs among JEA’s customers (solar and non-solar) dependent upon the electric grid” said Media Relations Coordinator Simone Garvey-Ewan.

JEA JEA’s energy mix 2018 – 2020.

A1A Solar’s Pete Wilking says that Florida’s rapid growth plus the increase in electric vehicles means there will be plenty of demand and it only makes sense to use existing space like rooftops for solar expansion. But he’s concerned about his industry’s ability to compete in the political realm.

“Little guys like us we don’t have big coffers to give massive campaign donations to lawmakers. We just don’t have the resources” Wilking said. “The biggest problem right now is that utility companies don’t know how to morph their business model to nicely accommodate rooftop solar. That’s where the rub is right now.”

Robert Silber retiring from ECCCM in May,"After 11 years at the helm of Eastern Catawba Cooperative Christian Ministry the Rev. Robert Silber is retiring. It’s time to pass the torch he said.

“This has been the best missional ministry I've ever worked” Silber said. “Recently I recognized I've done what I needed to do what I came to do and it's time for me to turn it over to the younger generation.”

Silber’s involvement with the crisis assistance ministry spans more than two decades. It was a difficult choice to retire but at 67 he knew it was time he said.

Silber first volunteered with ECCCM when he moved to Catawba County in 2000. He was placed as a pastor for a Catawba County Methodist church that had a youth group already volunteering with ECCCM. He decided to join them.

“Instantly fell in love with it” Silber said. “I continued to serve for almost 10 years as a volunteer.”

Silber got heavily involved with the organization — helping with capital campaigns serving on the board and helping it thrive.

In 2009 Silber was moved to pastor a church in Cabarrus County. He didn’t stay long because a year later ECCCM reached out. They were in need of a new executive director so Silber spoke with his bishop tasked with placing him at churches.

“At that time my bishop's words were ‘I can't think of a better place for a United Methodist pastor to be in the world’” Silber said.

Silber found his place at ECCCM. The organization’s mission and the work he was doing to help people drove him. It was the mission of ECCCM that kept Silber in the role.

“I stayed for the organization. My wife and I don't have children no family here nothing keeping us here but the mission of the ministry"" he said.

Silber said his proudest accomplishment has been implementing a crisis counseling program to help people who need a hand up out of a bad situation.

“I recognized people were coming to us for assistance but then they would come back again and again and again. I realized we weren't being a solution to the problem” Silber said. “I started writing a crisis assistance coaching program. … Now if someone lost their job ... and now can’t pay rent and come to ECCCM we’ll get you into the crisis assistance coaching program. Lost your job? Let’s find you a new job. Maybe a low income working poor person needs help — let us help you stretch your dollars find other resources. Our goal is to get you back on your feet where you don't have to come back to us.”

Over the years since starting the program Silber has watched hundreds of people get back on their feet.

“In your worst of days you have someone to lean on you're not alone” Silber said. “(The program) is near and dear to my heart. It’s been really really helpful to the community it's helpful to neighbors our clients the residents in Catawba County.”

Silber also worked to improve ECCCM by connecting it with local governmental and nonprofit partners and moving its records and systems to be entirely digital he said.

Silber is proud of his work but sensed it was time to let someone else improve the organization now he said.

“I’m getting tired my mind is getting tired” he said. “I love what I do but I’m tired.”

He had originally planned to retire in 2020 but when the COVID-19 pandemic presented the worst crisis the county and nation had seen in years he felt he couldn’t leave his post.

Now with the crisis on its tail end and his replacement trained this is his time. At the end of May Silber will retire and Kristal Manning ECCCM’s current assistant director will take over June 1. Manning was selected by the organization’s board of directors to be the next executive director.

Silber said in his decades of service with ECCCM one specific memory will stay with him for years to come. It was a simple moment — he walked into a case manager’s office to hand them some documents and absent-mindedly greeted the client sitting in the office.

“I looked at the client and just said ‘Hi how ya doing?’” Siber said. “And it was like God slapped me. She (the client) had an infant on her knee. A tear rolled down her face. I said ‘If you were doing well you wouldn't be here.’”

The client said she didn’t have food to feed her baby. The moment was a tangible example of the need ECCCM served in Catawba County.

“I told her ‘When you leave here today you’ll have food for your baby and food for your house’” Silber said. “For me food is not an issue I’ve never experienced that. But this was very tangible — here is a person in need. That is one of the examples that will never leave me. She was desperate … and that is just horrible.”

In his retirement Silber plans to relax for a year but knows ultimately he’ll find himself in another position helping others he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYmFsbGR1cmhhbS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMS9kdWtlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtd2VhcG9uLXJldHVybmVkLWVwaWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patented Duke basketball weapon has returned in epic fashion,They didn’t score after this 👊🔒 pic.twitter.com/piaV7F9M8h

The memo the newspaper reports indicates that the multibillion-dollar company worried in 2011 about the potential cost of offsetting its emissions of chloroprene a “likely human carcinogen” and preceded DuPont’s decision in 2015 to sell the LaPlace facility to Japanese chemical company Denka. According to the newspaper and the memo that was made public last week DuPont codenamed the sale of the plant “Project Elm.”

“They do their research; they do their due diligence so they’ve known for some time what they’ve been doing” Lydia Gerard a St. John resident who’s the lead plaintiff in a suit against DuPont and Denka said in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s like ‘Let’s get rid of this before we have to spend money on it.’”

Gerard who lost her husband to cancer in 2018 said in a Thursday phone interview that over the years DuPont never notified residents of the emissions.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency the plant continues to release chemical pollutants into the air at excessively high quantities.

Residents who live near the plant in St. John the Baptist Parish — the heart of America’s “Cancer Alley” — believe the toxic pollution which has been emitted from the plant for nearly a half century is to blame for their illnesses and are suing both DuPont and Denka.

Robert Taylor president of Concerned Citizens of St. John and another plaintiff in the lawsuit against the companies said by phone Tuesday: “They refused to adhere to the EPA recommended levels.”

The Illuminator reviewed air monitoring records from as recently as January 2020 that show the plant has regularly emitted chloroprene vapors at more than 50 times the level deemed safe by the EPA. The EPA has been monitoring and collecting air samples from the site since 2016 when it fined DuPont $37500 for previous Clean Air Act violations from when it owned the LaPlace facility.

The DuPont memo written by the company’s then president of polymers Diane Gulyas was sent to the chief executive with the title “Approval to Conduct an Auction and Negotiate the Sale of Neoprene” as revealed by the Guardian.

Chloroprene is the key chemical in the manufacture of neoprene synthetic rubber. The EPA reclassified chloroprene as a likely carcinogen in 2010. That reclassification was reflected in the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) map released by the EPA in 2015 which “showed an elevated risk for cancer in the area around the Denka plant in LaPlace” according to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

DuPont’s memo cited the reclassification of chloroprene as the primary reason to sell the plant and cautioned that new compliance regulations could be put in place in 2012 or 2013 stating: “Measures required to achieve compliance may entail capital expenditures.”

However Louisiana authorities never compelled DuPont to regulate its emissions at the plant. It was only after the sale to Denka that with increasing public scrutiny regulators began enforcing environmental laws at the plant. In 2016 the EPA wrapped up a two-year investigation of the plant’s Clean Air Act violations and thereafter Denka entered into a 2017 voluntary agreement with the Louisiana DEQ to reduce stack emissions by 85% according to the DEQ’s website.

Residents were not satisfied with DEQ’s settlement with Denka. An 85% emissions reduction means the plant is still polluting the air with chloroprene at levels well-above (in some cases 10 times higher) than the amount deemed non-hazardous by federal regulators.

“They want citizens to think they’re taking legitimate action but they’re not” Taylor said of Denka and LDEQ.

DuPont has claimed in court records that it is not liable for the pollution.

“While we do not comment on pending litigation we will vigorously defend our record of safety health and environmental stewardship” DuPont spokesman Daniel Turner wrote in an email to the Illuminator.

For its part Denka the new owner has said it was unaware of the EPA’s air pollutants report that highlighted cancer risks in LaPlace when it purchased the plant from DuPont.

The Guardian has led a sustained reporting project on pollution in St. John Parish.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1Z2J5ZHVtcC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLWlzLWhvdy1mcmFuY2Utd2lsbC1jb3BlLXdpdGgtdGhlLWxvc3Mtb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1wcmVtaWVyLW51bWJlci1uaW5lL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnJ1Z2J5ZHVtcC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLWlzLWhvdy1mcmFuY2Utd2lsbC1jb3BlLXdpdGgtdGhlLWxvc3Mtb2YtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1wcmVtaWVyLW51bWJlci1uaW5lLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is how France will cope with the loss of the world's premier number nine | RugbyDump,"The news that France’s Antoine Dupont was among five players to have tested positive for COVID-19 this week comes as a huge disappointment to fans of the game as the influential scrum-half will miss next weekend’s Six Nations match against Scotland in Paris.

ADVERTISEMENT

Along with team-mates Mohamed Haouas Gabin Villière Arthur Vincent and Julien Marchand Dupont received his positive test result on Friday morning as 19 other players tested negative. Earlier in the week head coach Fabien Galthié and forwards coach William Servat also tested positive for the virus.

The FFR conducted more tests on Saturday with hooker Julien Marchand and centre Arthur Vincent also returning positive test results with a revised 31-man squad announced on Sunday morning by Galthié.

Voici la liste des 31 joueurs convoqués dans le groupe #XVdeFrance à partir de ce soir à Marcoussis afin de préparer le match contre l’Écosse ! Suite à des tests complémentaires réalisés hier Julien Marchand et Arthur Vincent ont été testés positifs à la Covid-19.#NeFaisonsXV — France Rugby (@FranceRugby) February 21 2021



These cases reportedly stemmed from a France Sevens player who caught the virus and became a close contact while training with the squad. The player hasn’t been named and no further information has been revealed by the French Rugby Federation (FFR).

It is the first time this Six Nations that a positive case has been found and while it was perhaps inevitable losing arguably the best player in the world right now in Antoine Dupont is sad to see.

Dupont’s most likely replacement for the third round match against the Scots should he not make the squad is Toulon’s Baptiste Serin.

ADVERTISEMENT

Serin alongside Clermont’s Sébastien Bézy was part of Galthié’s 31-man squad to prepare for the Scotland match and would appear to be the next best option at scrum-half to Dupont. But what impact will Dupont’s absence have on the French team and can Serin steer the ship in a similar way in Paris?

Dupont’s all-round performance is second-to-none and this will no doubt be missed. But Serin is an efficient player albeit with a slightly looser more indpendent game. Serin is more likely to take a quick tap penalty than Dupont and is a proficient goal kicker as well while Dupont has more control over structure box kicking and bringing forwards onto the ball.

The continuity of Dupont may also have an impact on the rest of the squad although one would imagine that with full match preparation with Serin at the helm this won’t be an issue. On top of that barring injury or Covid Serin is likely to turn out alongside Mathieu Jalibert who he played with at Bordeaux-Bègles.

France are a confidence side at the moment and if the last 12 months have shown us anything it’s that their strength in depth is equally as impressive. A largely second-string side nearly beat England in the final of the Autumn Nations Cup leaving few in any doubt that France has returned to the top table and has the depth of squad which suggests even losing someone as important as Dupont is unlikely to affect their flow.

ADVERTISEMENT

Serin is also playing for a Toulon side which is flourishing in the Top 14 again playing a similar sort of game to the national team. Led masterfully by club captain Charles Ollivon if France suddenly crumble and lose direction through the loss of Dupont it would be most unusual.

The same can be said about Villière’s absence with Teddy Thomas again the most likely to step in alongside Damien Penaud. France has already had to deal with depleted resources in their squad this campaign and showed that they were more than capable of stepping up to the task. Racing 92’s stand-out winger Donovan Taofifénua has also been called up to the wider squad and could join the bench next weekend.

Virimi Vakatawa meanwhile was meant to be the player to watch out for this season but an injury on the eve of the tournament meant that Arthur Vincent was called in as first choice outside centre alongside Gaël Fickou but he too has been forced out of the Scotland match. That means that Jonathan Danty Pierre-Louis Barrassi and Yoram Moefana – all of whom have been capped by France – are now left to man the central mid-field alongside Fickou.

Finally with the loss of Haouas you might be forgiven for thinking that France are now sweating for options in the front row. But this is another area where the squad is blessed with resource. Uini Atonio was a second half replacement in the victory over Ireland and provides ample might in the pack.

The situation is far from ideal for Galthié’s men but if they are to win the Six Nations for the first time since 2010 France will have to come up trumps in adversity. This is by far the greatest test they have faced in Galthié’s tenure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9ydWdieS11bmlvbi8yMDIxLzAyLzE5L2FudG9pbmUtZHVwb250LXRlc3RzLXBvc2l0aXZlLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWZyYW5jZS1mYWNlLWRpc3J1cHRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Number of positive coronavirus cases in French squad rises to nine ahead of Six Nations clash with Scotland,"France will face Scotland without a third of the starting team that took on Ireland after it was revealed that two more of their players have tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday.

Centre Arthur Vincent and hooker Julien Marchand have joined scrum-half Antoine Dupont wing Gabin Villière and prop Mohamed Haouas in being ruled out of their country’s third Six Nations outing of 2021.

All of them featured in France’s 15-13 win in Dublin and the camp is dealing with four further cases of coronavirus among the management. Head coach Fabien Galthié and assistant William Servat are known to have tested positive.

Vincent Marchand Dupont Villière and Haouas were all absent from a 31-man squad that will prepare to host Scotland as France bid to keep alive their hopes of a first Grand Slam since 2010.

Uncapped scrum-half Maxime Lucu hooker Teddy Baubigny and centres Jonathan Danty and Yoram Moefana have been included.

Danty and Moefana combined in midfield for the Autumn Nations Cup final against England last year. They could reprise that centre partnership if the versatile Gael Fickou Shaun Edwards’ defensive captain is shifted to the wing to cover for Villière. The presence of both Damian Penaud and Teddy Thomas means that is not a certainty.

Baubigny of Racing 92 may be behind Pierre Bourgarit a replacement against Ireland and Peato Mauvaka. At tighthead prop France still have Dorian Aldegheri and Uini Atonio available and 22-year-old Demba Bamba is in contention for a first Test appearance since last November’s trip to Murrayfield.

The task of replacing Dupont the reigning Six Nations player of the Championship would seem likely to fall to 40-cap Baptiste Serin.

Before the players returned to France’s Marcoussis training centre after a Six Nations bye week they underwent tests on Friday.

Dupont the Six Nations player of the year in 2020 who has played a big role in France’s two opening victories in this year’s tournament was tested in the morning along with the other Toulouse internationals and his result announced in the afternoon.

The French Rugby Federation (FFR) announced on Saturday that Haouas of Montpellier and Toulon’s Villiere returned positive tests later Friday.

The FFR said two other potential squad members lock Swan Rebbadj and prop Jean-Baptiste Gros both of Toulon had been in contact with known positive coronavirus cases at their club.

The FFR announced later on Saturday that Karim Ghezal one of two forward coaches. had tested positive. The other forwards coach William Servat tested positive earlier in the week.

Galthie tested positive on Tuesday while Servat and a third unnamed coach did so on Wednesday.

A new list of 31 players summoned to Marcoussis to prepare for the match against Scotland on 28 February will be announced on Sunday. The three positive players could be on it.

In France the quarantine period will increase to 10 days from Monday but was still seven days on Friday which means Dupont could return to training next Friday and Haouas and Villiere on Saturday ahead of the game against Scotland in Paris on Sunday.

France opened the Six Nations with victories in Rome on February 6 in the first round when Dupont was named player of the round and in Dublin in the second round on February.

Dupont Haouas and Villiere started both games. Gros came off the bench in Rome.

After negotiations with the clubs and the government France assembled a squad of 31 in a bubble in Nice at the end of January but along with other nations decided to allow their players a break in the Six Nations bye week.

A long-delayed trial involving Haouas over 2014 robberies of tobacconists was postponed at the end of January because the player was in the France squad."

If you're smitten with the actor and musician you're probably curious about Ross Lynch's dating history. Without some sleuthing Lynch's flirty pics with co-stars could be a bit confusing. Luckily I did the digging so you don't have to.

First let me give it to you straight: If you're an OG Austin & Ally fan who shipped Lynch with Laura Marano they never actually dated. They have however remained friends who post cute throwbacks of each other on Instagram.

Likewise you may have stanned Lynch during the Teen Beach Movie era and shipped him with Morgan Larson. (Exhibit A: this cheek-kissing picture.) Or maybe you shipped Lynch with Maia Mitchell who he called ""a good kisser"" after the two threw an unscripted kiss into Teen Beach 2. While there has been plenty of speculation over the years Lynch has never confirmed a relationship with neither Larson nor Mitchell. Although he has added fuel to the fire by saying he found himself in a love triangle on the set of Teen Beach Movie and never confirming who with. Woof.

Robert Simpson who became a household name right across Canada got his start right here on Main Street in Newmarket. His story is one of the most requested during my heritage presentations. Let us take a trip back to 1855 and the arrival in Newmarket of a young Simpson.

Robert Simpson was born Sept. 17 1834 in Speymouth Scotland the son of Peter Simpson and Jane Christie Parmouth. His father was a general store owner.

Simpson was educated at a Scottish grammar school until the age of 16 when he began to apprentice with an Elgin storekeeper.

Simpson as a young man of 21 arrived in Canada from Inverness Scotland in 1855 and decided to make Newmarket his home apparently because he had a cousin living here.

Cousin James Simpson followed Robert to Newmarket shortly after.

Simpson was already experienced in the grocery trade and he decided to take work as a clerk in the general store of D. Sutherland and Sons. When the store was sold to the Whimsters two years later he apparently felt confident enough to strike off on his own and launch a business.

Simpson opened Simpson & Trent with a friend selling groceries boots shoes and dry goods. To cope with excessive competition at a time of economic depression the partners offered the lowest possible prices around and following a North American trend at the time announced they would do business only in cash.

However indications are that their purchases of local farm produce were done on a credit basis.

This partnership was dissolved in March 1862 with Simpson deciding to operate the store on his own. It is clear from the local newspaper that Simpson was having money problems as he was putting notices in the paper begging his clients to settle their bills.

After only a few months Simpson entered another partnership on May 14 1862 with Moses W. Bogart with Bogart’s involvement being underwritten by his father John. The new business was called Simpson & Bogart which gradually developed a strong local wholesale business with small stores in several adjacent communities.

Simpson would build a reputable business here in Newmarket lasting for almost 10 years when disaster would strike. On Dec. 6 1862 the first of several fires that he would endure in his career struck damaging or destroying his premises.

Luckily the $1000 loss on this occasion was covered by insurance and business resumed almost immediately. A second fire on Feb. 19 1864 however inflicted far greater damage and necessitated a temporary relocation.

This fire triggered the withdrawal of Bogart from the partnership on March 9 although it is said that his departure was largely due to earlier business problems.

Using funds received from the insurance payment Simpson liquidated the bulk of his debts with longtime supplier Thompson Claxton and Company of Montreal and independently re-established himself in Newmarket.

On Oct. 29 1870 a raging fire destroyed both the store and all the stock. Undeterred he reopened in time for the Christmas trade. The losses had been severe however and Simpson was forced to declare bankruptcy in early 1871.

It was likely this disaster that prompted him to relocate to Toronto where opportunities were far more plentiful.

So how did Simpson meet Bogart and the Charles Botsford family both of whom were to play a large part in his Newmarket life?

On the site of what was to become the Sport and Cycle Shop mid-block on the west side between Botsford and Timothy streets was the Botsford house where both Charles Botsford a former merchant and daughter Mary Ann lived.

John Botsford’s woodworking shop was practically next door to his home. Mary Ann Botsford became Robert’s wife on March 29 1859. Miss Botsford was considered the leading soprano in the church choir circuit.

Simpson was to locate his shop at the corner of Timothy and Main streets at 228 Main where Soupa is now located.

It helped that Simpson was connected to many of the leading families in Newmarket. Anna Simpson a cousin married James Sutherland a prominent merchant in town and one of our leading politicians.

Interestingly Mrs. Sutherland lived to celebrate her 104th birthday one of the oldest on record here in town.

Simpson would also play an active part in the everyday life of the community. I found several references to his having been part of several local boards and committees. He was a supporter of the establishment of the Citizens’ Band and during a serious outbreak of cholera in 1866 a board of health would be organized and Simpson sat on the committee.

I assume he would know all the first families of Newmarket the Botsfords Bogarts etc. putting him in good stead for business.

He continued operations in Newmarket until the summer of 1872 when he sold his stock-in-trade to his cousin James and moved with his family to Toronto.

Some time in the winter of 1872–73 he opened a small dry goods store named R. Simpson Dry Goods with a staff of three clerks at 184 Yonge St. just north of Queen Street an area of the city beginning to attract the custom of those who normally shopped on King Street.

Simpson understood that he needed to distinguish himself from the stiff competition as there were 13 other dry goods businesses situated within a few blocks of each other including of course the T. Eaton Company.

During the 1860s there was a revolution in the urban retail industry and it is reported that Simpson was able to claim an annual sales volume in 1866 of $60000.

In April 1867 he moved into what he considered “the largest and finest shop north of Toronto.”

Using imaginative advertisements handbills and flyers distributed throughout the countryside he not only kept up with his competition but improved his credit standing.

There was a move by retailers of the time to obtain merchandise directly from their suppliers and manufacturers in Great Britain. This may have been responsible for his visit back to Scotland in the winter of 1868–69 his first since his arrival in Canada. Despite Simpson’s obvious success his health during his latter years in Newmarket appears to have given him cause for concern and may have been related to a drinking problem.

A fire on Oct. 29 1870 destroyed his stock valued at around $40000 most of it on consignment and much of it not covered by insurance. He was criticized in the press for irresponsibility and for carrying a stock vastly out of proportion to his annual volume of sales. During the bankruptcy proceedings it was alleged that Simpson showed “a most culpable carelessness in the conduct of his business” and he was criticized for his heavy dependence on the credit system. His accounting methods were also said to be slack.

Simpson’s business in Toronto seems to have been conducted in partnership with his brother-in-law Charles Botsford at least until July 1879.

In the winter of 1879-80 Simpson in partnership with his cousin James Simpson and James Robertson established a wholesale dry goods business on Colborne Street. At about the same time Timothy Eaton also established a wholesale business in Toronto both merchants following the new trend to move from the retail to the wholesale business.

It is now clear that they both entered the wholesale industry at the wrong time as there were diminishing returns.

Simpson’s wholesale venture met with only limited success and by 1885 it was operated as both a retail and a wholesale outlet. Robertson withdrew from the partnership in 1886 and the death of James Simpson in November 1889 brought the enterprise to a swift end.

Simpson was then able to devote his full attention to his original retail store which in 1881 had moved into larger premises at 174-76 Yonge adjacent to the Eaton’s store.

In the summer of 1883 Eaton needing larger premises moved farther north to 190 Yonge but indicative of the competition between these two men he kept his old store locked up and vacant for more than six months to ensure that Simpson could not move in and take advantage of the Eaton connection.

Simpson seems about the only store owner mentioned by Eaton in letters to his brother suggesting that Eaton regarded him with perhaps more seriousness than some of his smaller competitors.

Though competition was rampant among all dry goods merchants in the 1870s and 1880s and though the two founders differed dramatically in personality (Eaton being a strict Methodist teetotaller Simpson reportedly a heavy drinker) there seems to have been no indication of the intense rivalry that would later exist between their stores. Interestingly both Thomas Eaton and his son John Craig attended Robert Simpson’s funeral and the flags of the Eaton’s store flew at half-mast that day.

Simpson’s store which by 1885 offered a growing variety of merchandise and employed nearly 60 clerks was by the early 1890s operating as a full-fledged department store retailing everything from dry goods to groceries patent medicines to furniture.

Its success was largely a product of aggressive selling techniques and the adoption of a cash one-price-only system at a time of increased demand for consumer goods.

On March 3 1895 less than three months after its opening the new Simpsons store burned to the ground falling victim to the third major fire in Toronto in less than two months. Undaunted and defiant Simpson re-opened for business as soon as possible rebuilding his store.

Exactly six days after the fire Simpsons was once again welcoming customers however in rented premises. The store would move back into a new and improved building at the Queen and Yonge location in just over 10 months.

The architecture firm Burke & Horwood resolved to make this second building the best of its kind. To lessen the risk of fire the new building was built on a steel frame the first in Canada.

The rolled steel girders were fire-proofed with concrete and the columns spaced at greater intervals. This structure still stands today the original core of a much larger building that now occupies the entire city block.

The staff by this time comprised more than 500 employees serving in 35 departments with a restaurant and a well-organized mail order department. In May the store was formed into a joint-stock company the Robert Simpson Company Limited with Robert as president.

Sadly Simpson did not live to see his company thrive for long after that 1895 fire as he would die on Dec. 14 1897. His sudden death with no son to inherit the business placed a heavy burden on his wife and daughter Margaret.

The business was sold in March 1898 for $135000 to a syndicate of three Toronto businessmen Harris Henry Fudger Joseph Wesley Flavelle and Alfred Ernest Ames. In 1978 the Hudson’s Bay Company purchased it and the Simpson name disappeared from the landscape.

There is an Ontario government plaque marking his birthplace in Inverness Scotland a plaque on the building in Toronto and one embedded in the sidewalk in front of his first store on Main Street here in Newmarket.

Members of Norfolk County Council’s transforming cities committee heard the plans for the station ahead of putting them out to public consultation.

Martin Wilby chairman of the committee praised the plans saying it would be doing something to improve one of the busiest areas in the city.

The committee members also welcomed the proposals with councillor Brian Watkins saying: ""I hope the proposals turn out to be an important step in improving overall connectivity between the railway station and the bus station.

""Access between those hubs has to become much easier much quicker and much better coordinated.""

The plan would see several existing pedestrian island on the Foundry Bridge junction removed and a widened signalised crossing installed Riverside Road leg of the junction.

On Thorpe Road which carries more than 300 buses a day the stretch between Riverside Road and Lower Clarence Road will be made into a bus lane to improve journey times into the city centre.

Improvements to provide footway continuity are mooted for side roads off Riverside Road to benefit pedestrians while Chalk Hill Road and St Matthews Road could become one way to stop rat-running.

The scheme also provides the opportunity to link with the existing cycle lane at the eastern end of Prince of Wales Road and which continues along Rose Lane providing a segregated cycle route into the city centre.

The plans have already seen support from First Buses who said the plans will “vastly reduce the journey time between the rail station and the city centre and destinations beyond”.

First said they anticipate peak journey times from the Thorpe Road stop to the city centre will be 3-4 minutes down from 10-12 minutes at peak times.

The introduction of the bus lane along Thorpe Road will result in general traffic heading into the City from the east along Thorpe Road being re-routed with plans to improve coordination between the traffic signals.

The scheme has been put forward as part of the Department for Transport's Transforming Cities Fund which has seen £32m awarded to the city for its roads network.

The plans were approved for going out to public consultation which is expected to start in March."
EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ktYm91Z2h0LWEtOTAwMDAwMG1haC1wb3dlci1iYW5rLWZyb20tZWJheS1hbmQtaS1nb3Qtd2hhdC1pLWRlc2VydmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I bought a 9000000mAh power bank from eBay and I got what I deserved,"OK the other day someone suggested that I head over to eBay and for a laugh look for the largest advertised power bank I could find.

Within minutes I'd found one that claimed to be a whopping 9000000mAh; amazing since it's small and a chunky power bank like the Zendure SuperTank Pro is only 26800mAh.

Oddly the capacities topped out at 9 million mAh and I couldn't find a 10 million mAh power bank. I'm not sure whether that would just be too ridiculous or 9000000 looks bigger than 10000000.

Anyway I had to buy one. I expected it to be bad. And £14 (about $20) and a few days later I got what I deserved.

I got what I deserved!

'9 million mAh' power bank

Before I show you the power bank I want to share how the eBay listing goes to lengths to explain why the power bank doesn't have a capacity rating printed on it.

The explanation as to why no capacity is printed on the power bank

Hmmm.

OK the power bank. It's the typical cheapo power bank with a solar panel and some rubber around the edges to make it look rugged. Beyond this there's nothing about the power bank that's designed to prevent water or dirt ingress.

It has a single microUSB port for charging along with two USB-A output ports. It has a 9-LED flashlight on the back and some cheap rubber flaps cover the ports.

On stripping it apart I found the typical circuit board for these kinds of power banks (the board has a 2015 date screen-printed on the board). The battery didn't have any markings but it is the size I'd expect for a 10000mAh cell (and discharge tests showed that it was indeed a 10000mAh cell to within 10 percent).

The power bank promised a maximum output of 2.1A at 5V but when I put it under a 2A load the voltage dropped to 4V and the power bank quit within a few seconds.

It doesn't like being pushed to the rated capacity

So what I ended up with was a power bank with less than 1/900th of the rated capacity that wasn't capable of delivering the maximum rated output. The LED flashlight was OK but the on/off switch was poor and became unreliable after a few presses.

Oh and the power bank also came with a compass on a keyring; unfortunately the compass points to the metal ring in the keyring so even that's junk.

It's almost like this power bank's entire life's purpose was to take $20 out of my bank account.

Even the compass is junk :(

Now as is the case with products like this that are sold in the UK I liaise with UK trading standards officers to get products like this removed from sale.

Bottom line: don't waste your money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpodW5ld3NsZXR0ZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMS8wMi9yZWNyZWF0aW5nLW1lYW5pbmctYS1ndWlkZS10by1lYmF5LWFuZC1wYW5kZW1pYy13aW5kb3ctc2hvcHBpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recreating meaning: a guide to eBay and pandemic window shopping,"There came a point during quarantine where I found myself on eBay for at least four hours every night. I scrolled through pages and pages of search terms like “Penny Lane Almost Famous jacket brown” “1960s lace nightgown full-length pink floral” and “patterned wicker basket big picnic.” There was something comforting about navigating the website’s interface which at first seems designed to make finding and purchasing listings impossible that provided me a feeling of comfort and ease.

The joy in eBay scrolling is not necessarily just the bargains available on the website. However the discounts are not to be discredited — I am almost certain the main demographic of eBay sellers are grandmas who just do not know how much a Y2K baby tee can go for these days.

Unlike Depop and other similar reselling platforms eBay is not curated by any real sort of algorithm. There is no feed when you log onto the website. What you search for is what you get so you have to really start figuring out search terms to find what you want. It feels great for once to be online and not feel as if every part of the website is trying to spoon-feed you content that will keep you coming back for more. The eBay site is perfect for curing those days where you simply no longer wish to be perceived by the algorithm.

Here are some of my favorite search terms: “novelty lampshade” “vintage lot love letters” “vintage Edwardian” “‘90s does ‘70s” “novelty vintage lighter” “art deco mirror” “junk drawer collectibles” “distressed vintage top” “rare vintage rug” “vintage tourist shirt” and “vero cuoio boots.”

While I do enjoy purchasing from eBay (two of my favorite finds are a Hysteric Glamour striped top and a ‘70s mini dress that makes me look like I’m straight out of the Little Women movie) for me it mainly fills the void of window shopping that the pandemic has taken away. I miss spending hours in a store going through racks of clothing and feeling the fabric between my fingers as I hunt for even one item. I miss trying on things I had no intention of buying and while eBay cannot replicate this for me it’s as close as I can get.

I love seeing what random stuff is listed on the website. Thousand-dollar Chanel dresses Jean Paul Gaultier tops the ugliest lampshades anyone has ever seen ornate Regency-style mirrors giant postcard collections from places I will never visit collectible vintage fountain pens that cost more than a pair of shoes: ultimately all things that once meant something to someone else.

It is getting harder and harder for me to come to terms with all of the lost time we’ve had in the pandemic but I find that spending time looking at items that have been loved and will still be loved gives me a rare and earnest feeling of joy or at the very least comfort. I like to know that trinkets I love could one day end up in the college home of a 22-year-old decades from now. I like to know that on the rare occasion I do end up purchasing something after a long night of scrolling I am continuing the life of something that was maybe special to someone once — it allows me to feel closer to strangers than I have been able to feel in almost a year. Thank god for eBay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yMS9mcm9tLXRoZS1kb2Nrcy10by10aGUtZWJheS13aWxsLW9ubGluZS1tYXJrZXRwbGFjZXMtc2F2ZS10aGUtZmlzaGluZy1pbmR1c3RyedIBfmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yMS9mcm9tLXRoZS1kb2Nrcy10by10aGUtZWJheS13aWxsLW9ubGluZS1tYXJrZXRwbGFjZXMtc2F2ZS10aGUtZmlzaGluZy1pbmR1c3RyeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From the docks to the eBay – will online marketplaces save the fishing industry?,"On a bracing January morning in Hastings the British fishing industry feels becalmed. Just weeks after Brexit exporters are ensnared in red tape newspapers are full of doom about fish rotting in warehouses and lorries are being held in two-day queues. Here on the south coast Covid restrictions have closed most of the shacks that normally dole out oysters dressed crab potted shrimp and other local delights. None of the 20 or so boats that make up the Hastings inshore fleet have gone out either for a more old-fashioned reason: the weather. It’s rare they are able to fish on more than 150 days of the year and today is not one of them. There’s a persistent icy drizzle and a grey sea tumbles chaotically onto the beach.

Despite the unpromising conditions Ben King is trying to see the upside. For the past three years the start-up he co-founded with Aiden Berry Pesky Fish has been working to connect fishermen directly with wholesalers retailers restaurants and home chefs cutting out traditional middlemen. Using Pesky’s online marketplace a kind of piscine eBay customers can buy fish from Britain’s inshore fleet as soon as it’s landed and get it delivered anywhere in the country the next day. Some are offered with a “buy it now” price algorithmically generated; the rest is sold by auction. The promise is alluring: better value for the customer the freshest fish going and a higher price for the fishermen. Pesky Fish sells more than two tonnes of fish per day from Britain’s day boats and artisanal fish farmers.

“People will paint a dour narrative of the industry but in a longer-term view the past couple of months have been amazing” King says. “We’ve had the opportunity to speak to fishermen and buyers and ask them what they would want their market experience to be in an ideal world. We’re at an inflection point. The industry is not going to regress.”

Pesky has come a long way. “I originally wanted to do the seafood version of Flatiron” says King alluding to the group of low-cost high-quality steak restaurants. “It would be financially accessible and also provide a traceability narrative so you could tell where your fish had come from. It was predicated on my naivety. Slowly I realised that we couldn’t do it in seafood because there wasn’t real traceability in the supply chain. The quality was all over the shop.” He kept asking himself questions. “Why is the fish we eat 2-3 weeks old? Why has it had to pass through four or five pairs of hands to get to my plate? Why is 80% of it imported? It didn’t make sense and it became an itch that never went away.”

After delivering its first fish in November 2017 a turbot for Shaun Rankin at Ormer Mayfair in London Pesky grew quickly raising money through venture capital and spending time with Techstars a company that helps start-ups by offering connections and expertise in exchange for equity. Its reputation among chefs spread by word of mouth and an attractive Instagram presence full of gleaming sides of salmon and grizzled men holding bass. One early adopter was Jeremy Chan the chef-owner of Ikoyi the Michelin-starred restaurant in London’s Piccadilly.

“It was a different product altogether” says Chan. “The fish was basically still alive. It started to change our way of working with fish. We became more spontaneous and adaptable and let them dictate what fish we would put on our menu based on availability. I’d get a call saying: ‘I’ve got a 6kg turbot do you want it?’ It would be in the restaurant the next evening.” Part of the challenge he adds is letting customers know about the quality of what we have on our doorstep: “Britain is a Neanderthal food culture” he says “but a bountiful island for seafood and wildlife.”

After starting with individual boats Pesky has expanded to work with whole ports Hastings being the most recent addition. At first Berry and King focused on restaurants and wholesalers but when Covid-19 struck they set up a direct home delivery service taking advantage of the surge in interest that saw independent food shops’ sales rise more than 63% in the months after lockdown. On the main marketplace fish is sold in minimum 10kg crates but the home delivery market allows customers to buy individual fish off the day boats as well as high-end farmed products such as mussels from the River Teign or Wester Ross salmon smoked with heather honey by Iain Boyd in Ullapool. King says only around half their business is in London and they’re having as much success outside big cities where fishmongers have closed and supermarkets might have shut their fish counters.

“We were looking for a fish supplier for ages then we read about Pesky in the Observer [in last year’s OFM50 our annual guide to new people places and trends]” says Stefano Cuomo who runs the Macknade artisan food halls in Kent. “We like our produce to have that direct relationship with the community so customers could engage with the produce and understand it. You can do that online but really it happens over the counter. We don’t stock tuna or cod we stock sole and mackerel and cuttlefish and we can tell customers exactly where it has come from and how to cook it.”

The sunlit uplands where British consumers start buying eating and appreciating their own seafood is simpler in theory than in practice. Pesky is cheaper than most fishmongers but more expensive than supermarkets. Forty years of integration into the EU means our fish is locked into a labyrinth of regulations trade agreements and processing systems that will take years to reverse.

One gripe from people in the industry is that British fish is more prized on the continent or even further afield in east Asia or the US than it is here. Dover sole crab and lobster are exported to restaurants in Europe while our cheaper fish is sent to Germany turned into fish fingers and reimported. Partly it’s tradition. French restaurants will happily sell four small Dover soles as a dish while the British customer expects one large fillet. It’s also about tastes. If an agent doesn’t think he can sell a fish to merchants he won’t buy it off the fishermen. By cutting out intermediary layers Pesky is helping revive unfashionable options. “Take pouting” says King. “It used to be a bycatch but now places like Smoking Goat are using it where they might have used cod. It’s cheaper for the customer and the overall catch is more valuable.”

Changing customer habits will take time. For now everyone must contend with Brexit and Covid. “It’s a double sucker-punch” says Paul Joy who has been fishing these waters for more than 42 years and now runs the Hastings Fishermen’s Protection Society from a small office overlooking the beach. A few days before we meet fishermen protested in Parliament Square against the Brexit agreement which they feel has betrayed them. Fishing rights were one of the sticking points in the months leading up to the December deadline. Joy and Mark Ball like most of the industry were strongly in favour of Brexit which they hoped might address long-held grievances. Both men started fishing before the UK joined the EU and remember an era before quotas and overfishing and Belgian super-trawlers running up alongside their little boats. “I started when I left school” says Ball “and by the time I was 20 I had my own boat. You could make a living. You couldn’t do that today.”

Joy agrees. “Before we joined the EU my family had been fishing here sustainably for 1000 years” he says. With the Brexit deal fishermen have ended up with the worst of all worlds. “It’s as bad as it’s ever been. At least with a no deal we’d have had our 12-mile rights. At the moment we’ve lost everything.”

Hastings signed up to Pesky after a venture to run their own wholesaling failed. The Pesky pitch offering daybook fishermen better prices for their fish and better value to the consumer was persuasive. They say there have been times when a fisherman would get 20p for a kilogram of lemon sole. Pesky sells them for £4.99 a fish. At some high-end fish shops a single 500g fish can sell for £14 excluding delivery. “Lots of companies have come and gone especially the ones that relied on export” Joy says. “That’s why we were excited to see Pesky come in. They’re looking more at local markets and local consumers. We’ve got to get away from exporting everything we catch.”

“We’ve always been non-political” King says. “We have to create the best opportunities we can regardless of the situation. We want to make the distribution of value fairer and push as much value back to the boats who put in such a ridiculous amount of effort.”

Towards the end of last year there was an awful reminder of just how much is at stake for these men and handful of women. In the early hours of November 21 the Joanna C a 45-foot Brixham scalloper and one of Pesky’s suppliers sank off the East Sussex coast. The crewmen Robert Morley and Adam Harper drowned; the skipper Dave Bickerstaff was rescued after clinging to a buoy having escaped from underneath the capsized boat and stayed next to Robert in the water for several hours. Morley’s mother Jackie Woolford said: “My Robert wasn’t alone when he died. His skipper stayed with him all the time.”

“It was a stark reminder that British consumers don’t have any exposure to the risks that come with fishing” King says. “Nothing can be said or done to make up the loss to those families. But I felt it brought people closer together. It’s why we want to keep promoting the industry and exposing people to the challenges that come with it. If we can make a good thing come of it that’s the best thing we can do for the fishermen we lost.”

The dream of making fishing more efficient has been around for decades. From Marseille to Kerala there have been experiments and studies in reforming the industry. Although Pesky is the leading British start-up in its field fishing and aquaculture are attracting attention from entrepreneurs around the world. Sea to Table and Dock to Dish are comparable businesses in the US while Blue Lobster is doing something similar in Denmark. For the most part however start-ups have focused on streamlining the middle sections of the market rather than the whole ocean-to-plate journey.

We don't want make incremental benefits of 10% here or there but ask ourselves how to make it 10 times better Ben King Pesky Fish

Fishing has so far proved resistant to change and is still conducted more or less as it was 100 years ago. Fishermen land their catch where it is collected by a merchant who sells it on to a wholesaler and then on to individual retailers before it gets to the customer. By the time you’re squeezing a lemon over your bass it could have been through six or seven hands each of whom has taken a cut. There is often a complex web of personal loyalties. A chef has often worked with his supplier for years and the supplier in turn knows to hold back the best fish for the long-term client. Pesky’s supply is necessarily limited by what the boats can catch. It’s great if you’re open-minded about which fish you want like Chan but less so if you know you need 200 halibut for Friday night.

In a world where everyone has a smartphone the justification for a byzantine system of middlemen with layers of bureaucracy between ocean and dinner table looks increasingly thin. While Paul Joy and Mark Ball hope Pesky can provide better prices for their catch as well as an effective domestic marketing operation there is no magic bullet. Pesky is subject to the market like everyone else. It hasn’t dented their ambition.

“The tagline although I hate that word is ‘feed the world sustainably with seafood’” says King. Fish proving difficult to sell to Europe could be exported further afield. Chalk Stream Trout a Pesky supplier championed by Jamie Oliver and Yotam Ottolenghi has noticed a rise in sales to the US. If the Pesky system works in the UK it might also work elsewhere. Its next venture might be to reform tuna markets in Sri Lanka for example rather than taking on another British port.

It was 1984 when Hermès debuted The Birkin Bag a handcrafted leather carryall featuring two sturdy top handles and a lock and key closure to ensure all of the bag's contents remained inside the bag. At the time the bag named for British actress and singer Jane Birkin retailed for approximately $2000 to $3000.

The Birkin Bag would one day become the most sought after bag in the world a status symbol creating legions of fans and spurring a years-long waiting list of eager buyers from around the globe willing to pay five to six figures for a single bag.

I've been interested in fashion since I was a child.

I spent many summers accompanying my grandmother to local garage sales. Born in 1920 and having survived the Great Depression my grandmother was understandably frugal and recognized the value in good quality objects.

We would sift through items in search of jewelry and pottery that she would later resell for a higher price at her own garage sale. She was an incredible salesperson and while I didn't realize it at the time these experiences taught me the joy and exhilaration of the hunt which would later define my interest in collectible objects that retain or gain value.

When I turned 17 I spent the summer living in New York City studying fashion illustration and draping at Parsons School of Design. Upon graduating high school I went on to The Art Institute of Chicago where I earned a BFA while working in sales at Chicago's newly opened Ralph Lauren store.

Diploma in hand I returned to New York in 1999 taking on a series of fashion editorial-related jobs at Conde Nast rotating between Mademoiselle Self and Allure before moving on back to retail.

I fell in love with the social component of fashion while working in retail.

While I became accustomed to being surrounded by luxury products what really fueled my interest in fashion was engaging with customers and helping them find what they wanted. In 2001 I decided I wanted to return home to Chicago and so I requested a job transfer to the location where I'd initially worked.

The following year I took a sales position at Hermès.

Back then there were only eight of us in the Chicago store and we were each assigned an area of specialty. Mine was leather goods and scarves — not because I possessed any special knowledge in those areas but simply because that was the section that needed to be filled at the time.

As part of my training I was invited to travel to Paris where I had the opportunity to meet with the craftsman tour the distribution facilities and pay a visit to the Hermès Museum a venue exclusively reserved for staff and select guests. My new work aligned perfectly with my art history background and for me every transaction was like selling a piece of art.

Over the years I assisted thousands of customers and sold countless Birkin Bags.

In fact one of my longtime customers who was a collector referred to me as ""The Birkin Fairy"" or ""Fairy"" for short because my position allowed me to grant Hermès wishes.

It's almost impossible to be able to walk into a store and buy a Birkin off the shelf. You can put in a request for one but no one knows how long you'll be waiting. They've even placed a limit on how many Birkins a client may purchase each year. All of these factors have caused a thriving resale market.

Even after working at Hermès for 10 years I had to get special permission from the powers that be to buy one for myself as a gift when my daughter was born in 2011. A few years later I managed to acquire a second less expensive one for $3000 as part of an employee sale of handbags that do not pass the company's quality standards and are therefore only offered to employees.

By 2013 I was a married mother of two and wanted to spend more time at home with my family.

In search of more flexibility I began interviewing at other companies but when a longstanding client asked if I could help her sell 20 pieces of her Hermès collection I decided to go out on my own in a different direction.

In 2014 I set up shop from a tiny desk in my bedroom. I invested $2000 to buy a domain name build a website and secure a few basic supplies before officially launching The Birkin Fairy a secondary luxury marketplace selling pre-owned Hermès products.

The first bag I sold was an orange Birkin that at the time was nine years old. My client originally paid $6600 for it in 2005 and it sold for $8700 in 2014.

To date I've sold nearly $2 million of Hermes products online through my website and Ebay. I sell all items on consignment brokering transactions on behalf of my clients for a commission ranging anywhere from 18 to 30%.

All my business is via word of mouth — I've never spent a dollar on customer acquisition.

I'm truly a one-woman operation from photographing products to acquiring and selling merchandise to shipping to social media where I have over 81000 organic Instagram followers.

Before COVID-19 I traveled across the country to meet with sellers helping them do everything from evaluate their inventory and determine what they'd like to sell to help them authenticate organize and care for their items. One of my clients in Los Angeles wound up having $505000 worth of Hermès handbags sitting in her closet and after reevaluating the contents we ended up selling $50000 worth of handbags and acquiring six new pieces for $98000.

My site has featured everything from a well-worn Birkin that sold for $8000 to the $150000 So Black feather Kelly Bag that I have up for sale right now which is only one of two bags ever made.

While I have worked with some celebrities most of my clients are just regular folks with amazing closets.

The resale market for Birkin Bags has always been robust.

This is because there is so much more inventory online and it's readily available — for a price. The pandemic has driven more interested buyers online and helped grow my business due to inventory shortages production delays and store closures.

One study from 2017 revealed that over 35 years the value of Birkin bags rose 500% with an annual increase of 14%. When you buy a Ferrari and drive it off the lot it immediately loses value.

The eight-part drama which earlier this week became iPlayer's most watched show has sparked a huge interest in 1970's style clothing - with some items gaining an 158 per cent increase in searches on eBay UK.

The show tells the story of serial killer Charles Sobhraj who drugged and killed at least a dozen people on the Hippie Trail in Asia in the 1970s with the help of his besotted lover and accomplice Marie-Andrée Leclerc.

Viewers were particularly captivated with Jenna Coleman's Leclerc whose wardrobe by Rachel Walsh featured the bright colours clashing prints and flared cuts of the 70s.

Halterneck tops became the most popular item of the series with searches soaring 158 per cent closely followed by print dresses at 86 per cent.

Flared trousers also proved popular with a rise of 31 per cent; while jumpsuits printed blouses kaftans cat-eye sunglasses large sunglasses and headscarves all gained an increase in searches.

Fashion Stylist to the stars Karen Williams who runs karenwilliamstylist told Femail that Coleman's character has been so popular as her style 'sparked a sense of freedom and expression' so separate from the restrictions Brits are currently living under.

'I don’t think we realise how much we have to thank Jenna Coleman’s 1970’s style for in the BBC’s hit TV show The Serpent' she said.

'Let’s just remind ourselves that the 1970’s era was commonly associated with rebellion and freedom. Can you see where I’m going with this?

'Undeniably what the character Andre LeClerc wears from her flamboyant tailored flared suits to her fabulous bohemian kaftans and the clashing printed headscarfs is a 1970s fashion masterclass on how rock this look and do it well.

'But the timing is everything. She has given us more than just ideas on how to style ourselves this summer but I’ll get to that in a moment LeClec has sparked a sense of freedom and expression away from the restrictions of working from home and all the online culture a lot us are bound to.

'She has given us excitement and hope even if it’s just rebelling through fashion you can almost taste it in the air a renaissance is near.'

And it's not just fashion that the show has inspired with 1970s-style homeware proving more popular than ever on the site.

Searches for rattan are up by 86 per cent while coloured glass macrame wicker chairs and shag rugs all gained traction on the site.

Sharing the essential items to invest in to achieve an authentic 70s look Karen emphasised that simply alluding to the era could be enough when it comes to statement looks such as bell sleeves and kaftans.

'Pair a high waisted flared jeans or high waisted tailored flared trousers with a printed shirt un-buttoned to the chest or a fitted logo t-shirt or tight deep ‘v’ neck jumper' advised Karen.

'A printed scarf folded flat and tied around the top of the head over the hair and tied underneath - if you don’t have one of those - your partners patterned work tie will do (he’s probably not wearing that at the moment)

'Oversized sunglasses - preferably coloured glass but not essential - I think smaller oval shaped glasses work just as well and don’t for the cat eye shape too.

'Bell sleeves Super fitted blazers and kaftans are all going part of it but remember you don’t have to go crazy - just a nod to the style sensation will be fine!'

Katie Eastwood Stylist Ambassador at Stitch Fix UK revealed that 'countless customers' who have been inspired by styling on the show have come to her for help in finding similar items to replicate the looks and seeking tips on how to style the pieces.

'One of the easiest looks to recreate from the show is the slick tailoring' said Katie 'Try pairing a brightly coloured suit for example a teal two-piece from Mango with a floral blouse from Scotch & Soda or Petite Mendigote.

'Be sure to lift the collar above the jacket lapel for a real 70s statement and the job’s done. The key here is colour and prints – the brighter the better and the more 70s you’ll look and feel – it also makes for an attention-grabbing work outfit for Zoom!

'If you’re not ready to be quite so daring stick to the statement trouser only and opt for a simple white blouse not forgetting to throw on a pair of oversized sunglasses statement earrings or a striking headscarf to add an additional nod to the 70s – a great tip as we head into spring.'

Who was Marie-Andrée Leclerc? In the Spring of 1975 Sobhraj met Marie-Andrée Leclerc a medical secretary travelling India and he acted as her guide of the country. Sobhraj had been financing his lifestyle by posing as either a salesman or drug dealer to impress tourists who he then drugged robbed and often murdered. Three months later Leclerc flew to Bangkok to meet him after months of him seducing her with love letters - turning blind eye to his philandering with local women. Besotted Leclerc became intwined in Sobhraj's vicious crime spree and would help him drug tourists to steal their passports and money Marie-Andrée Leclerc was accused of complicity in the murders namely those of Jean-Luc Salomon and Avoni Jacob. In 1980 she was convicted of the murder of Avoni Jacob though she has always denied involvement in the killings and was later released on the condition she remained in India. She returned to Canada to die of cancer in 1984. Advertisement

'Speaking of trousers another key item I look to include in my customer’s Fix if they’re looking to don a retro look is a pair of flared indigo jeans – possibly the most iconic denim style and one that will instantly transport you back to the 1970s.'

Sobhraj known as The Serpent drugged and killed at least a dozen Westerners on the Hippie Trail in Asia in the 1970s.

The criminal financed his lifestyle by posing as either a salesman or drug dealer to impress tourists who he then drugged robbed and often murdered.

By 1975 the killer was joined by Ajay Chowdhury a young indian man who would help him scam tourists by helping them out of situations he had caused for example providing shelter to victims he had poisoned.

While he claimed that murders were often accidental drug overdoses it was later alleged by investigators that his motive for murder was silencing victims who threatened to expose him.

In 1976 Sobhraj attempted to drug a group of 60 French students on holiday in New Delhi in an attempt to rob them of passports and cash by giving them sleeping pills disguised as antibiotics.

But this time it backfired when the poison began working a lot faster than he expected. When the first few students began falling where they stood the others became alarmed and called the police. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

But before his sentence was due to end in 1986 he threw a party for the guards and drugged them with sleeping pills to escape only to be arrested in Goa following a nationwide manhunt by police in India.

He knew that there was a warrant for his arrest in Thailand where he could face the death penalty and banked on being locked up in India for another decade.

His plan worked and when he was released in 1997 with no country to extradite him to the Indian authorities allowed him to return to Paris where he lived in luxury promoting his infamy.

A sighting of Sobhraj in Kathmandu in 2003 led to his arrest for the murders of two Canadians there in 1975.

A Nepali court sentenced the notorious criminal to life imprisonment in connection with the killing of an American backpacker in 1975."

Even though Electronic Arts typically doesn't reveal its box art for each year's edition of Madden until later in the summer it looks like the cover athlete for this the 2021 version of the game has leaked a bit early. Given the player in question's dominance in the NFL over the past few years it stands to reason the art we're seeing is also very much legitimate.

Based on a new leak that has stemmed from GameStop Derrick Henry the running back from the Tennessee Titans is set to appear on the cover of Madden NFL 22. Henry has far and away been the best running back in the league over the past couple of season and in 2020 ended up rushing for over 2000 yards. To put into perspective why this is a big deal it's a feat that has only been accomplished eight times in NFL history.

The leak in particular that sees Henry attached to Madden NFL 22 doesn't seem to show the standard cover art however. Instead it sees Henry with a crown drawn over his head next to the name ""King Henry"" which is one of his nicknames. If this art is used for Madden NFL 22 it seems more likely to be for a variant edition of the game rather than the standard box art.

It's also worth noting that the leak also doesn't mention a specific release date for Madden NFL 22. The date in the image that has come about still says ""TBD"" for now. That being said nearly every installment in the series tends to come out in August of each year so we can likely plan for this window once again.

While it's worth stressing that this leak could prove to not be legitimate GameStop has actually leaked art for sports games like this pretty often in the past. In fact just last month the cover for MLB The Show 21 was revealed a bit early thanks to a GameStop leak as well. With that in mind there's an extremely good chance that Henry will be the one gracing the cover of Madden this year.

Madden NFL 22 still hasn't been formally announced just yet but it will almost surely be releasing on PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series X and PC when it arrives later this year.

So what do you think about Derrick Henry potentially appearing on Madden this year? Be sure to let me know what you think either down in the comments or over on Twitter at @MooreMan12.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzLzIwMjEvMi8yMS8yMjI5MTc2MS9jdXJzZS1vZi1tb25rZXktaXNsYW5kLW1vdmllLWx1Y2FzZmlsbS1zcGllbGJlcmctY2FuY2VsZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Lucasfilm canceled Spielberg’s Curse of Monkey Island movie,"Over the almost 50 years that Lucasfilm has been a company some notable projects have fallen by the wayside — from games such as Star Wars 1313 Project Ragtag and Star Wars: First Assault to films including George Lucas’ original sequel trilogy. In this graveyard of scrapped and forgotten projects you’ll find the story of The Curse of Monkey Island an undeveloped animated film named after the third game in the popular video game series. Not only was this an attempt to bring the Monkey Island games to the screen but it signaled one of Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic’s first attempts to enter the world of digital features (a feat ILM wouldn’t manage until a decade later with Rango). In addition there were some high-profile names in the world of film attached with Steven Spielberg even linked to the project as a producer.

Lucasfilm has not shared many details publicly about the film since its cancellation in 2001 when the company shut down ILM’s digital story department the division working on the project. But that hasn’t stopped people from speculating over the decades on what happened to it — one persistent rumor being that the project eventually morphed into the first Pirates of the Caribbean film 2003’s The Curse of the Black Pearl.

Lucasfilm didn’t publicly confirm the Monkey Island film’s existence until 2011. That was when the Monkey Island Special Edition Collection came out containing storyboards of the film that the project lead for these games Craig Derrick had located and cleared for release.

In the years since many questions about the film have lingered. Who was involved? How far did it get to completion? Why was it canceled? Recently we were put in contact with the director of this long-forgotten project David Carson who had previously never commented publicly on his connection to the film. Carson had been a visual artist at ILM for many decades working on films such Star Wars: Return of the Jedi The Goonies and Jurassic Park before becoming part of the digital story department tasked with developing concepts and treatments for computer-animated features in the late ’90s. Together with former members of ILM he gave us new insight into the making of the Monkey Island film.

Frankenstein and the Wolfman

When Carson talks about Monkey Island he begins with the tale of another canceled ILM project: Frankenstein and the Wolfman.

Pixar originated as a group within Lucasfilm’s computer graphics division; it was spun out of the company as a separate corporation in early 1986. Carson who was working as a visual effects art director at the time says that Lucasfilm felt it had achieved all it could with the computer graphics division and wanted to focus on its own film projects as well as its famous visual effects company ILM. ILM typically worked with real materials such as plastics rubber and foam core to produce effects for movies but as the ’80s gave way to the ’90s the company began experimenting more and more with computers pioneering industry-leading digital effects for films such as The Abyss Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park. Despite the success of these films Carson says that ILM executives harbored fears about how digital effects would impact the visual effects industry.

“Doug Norby the president of Lucasfilm feared what might happen if computers were increasingly used to create visual effects” Carson tells us. “Computers were constantly becoming more powerful but cheaper. He feared a future where small groups of people with modest amounts of money could use computers to create effects similar to what ILM was currently providing but at far less cost. And he feared that the studios would gladly hire them.”

Then in 1995 Toy Story happened. When Pixar’s film about sentient toys became a critical and commercial hit many of Lucasfilm’s competitors rushed to develop similar computer-animated projects to capitalize on the new innovation in digital effects. Not keen on missing out ILM’s then-president Jim Morris established a team of eight people to develop ideas for CG-animated feature films. The plan was that ILM would develop concepts for animated films and then offer their services to other studios to help develop these projects further. According to Carson this was a potential way for ILM as a company to diversify and future-proof itself against the potential erosion of the visual effects business.

The first result of this was Frankenstein and the Wolfman a collaboration between Universal and ILM that hoped to revive Universal’s horror properties of the 1930s. There were two directors: Carson was attached to co-direct the project for ILM with Universal Pictures chairman Casey Silver selecting Tremors writer Brent Maddock to be Universal’s representative. Over the next few years the team produced multiple scripts as well as animatics and artwork from those who would later be involved with Monkey Island’s film adaptation. But the story was canceled before it ever made it to the screen with the main problem being Universal’s approval.

During development on the project there had been a shake-up at Universal with Silver resigning after the failure of Babe: Pig in the City at the box office. The new heads of production at the studio then conducted a review of the project the outcome being that Universal removed Maddock from it believing his script with Tremors collaborator S.S. Wilson to be “too dark.”

Universal allowed ILM to pick Maddock’s replacement and the company chose the project’s animation supervisor at ILM Tom Bertino. Carson and Bertino continued working on Frankenstein and the Wolfman with The Mummy director and screenwriter Stephen Sommers coming onboard to develop a treatment prior to starting production on The Mummy Returns. Sommers was soon distracted working on that sequel however and there was a period of silence with Carson requesting to leave during this time turning the project over to co-director Bertino.

“I was just getting no feedback from Universal” Carson says. “We would have shots in progress. We would have models of the creatures in progress and there was nobody to show them to nobody to approve them and a sense of ‘Is this all going to be disapproved later?’ I just felt like the film needed somebody who was actually in charge and who had the power to make decisions. And I didn’t feel like I had that power.”

“I met with Stephen Sommers a couple of times” says story artist Tony Stacchi who worked on Frankenstein and the Wolfman and Monkey Island at ILM. “He had a very different vision. So he came in and he gave his thoughts. But none of his thoughts really jived with what Dave wanted to do. He was a really nice guy but he was very into modernizing the myth and not being [beholden] at all to the old Universal thing. [...] So [Universal] were trying to find somebody to sort of take the ball and go forward with it and own it and I don’t think he was interested until after he finished [The Mummy Returns].”

Carson’s departure turned out to be the silver bullet for Frankenstein and the Wolfman which was canceled only a couple of months later. But ILM was not done with feature animation just yet.

Guybrush Threepwood mighty pirate

Shortly after leaving the Frankenstein project in 1999 Carson was on a weekend break with his 15-year-old son Neal for the Fourth of July out in the mountains near Clear Lake in Northern California when the conversation turned to the two’s shared love of LucasArts adventure games. One of the perks of working at ILM at the time was that Carson was able to get copies of the latest LucasArts games at a heavy discount so he would often play LucasArts point-and-click games with his kids when they were growing up.

During this conversation Carson asked his son whether he thought Monkey Island might make a good feature film and his son enthusiastically said it would. Then little more than a week later Carson was in Morris’ office at ILM talking about his idea for a film about grog ghouls and the adventures of a wannabe pirate named Guybrush Threepwood. Morris was unfamiliar with the games but he suggested taking the idea to Amblin Entertainment Steven Spielberg’s production company.

The original treatment that Carson wrote for the film was a rough adaptation of the first game 1990’s The Secret of Monkey Island with some changes here and there to the plot. One of the drafts for instance starts with a new scene with Guybrush described as “at most twenty years old” bumping into a local pirate at a seaside market. After a brief conversation in which Guybrush expresses his hopes of becoming a mighty pirate the pirate character tells Guybrush about Melée Island and informs him of a supply boat that he could hitch a lift on. The opening credits are then written as follows:

From high above we watch as the boat heads out into deeper waters and stronger waves. The Monkey Island theme music starts and the head-credits roll. In a series of cuts the small boat makes its way to Melee Island and in the final shot we see the supply boat pulling away from a sandy beach at dusk. On shore Guybrush happily waves to the uncaring crewmen. He turns and begins to make his way up a steep winding trail into the cliffs above. Night has fully fallen when we cut back to a wide establishing shot of Melee Island and the theme music ends.

The next scene segues into the opening of the first game with Guybrush standing on the cliffs overlooking Melée Island where he meets an old lookout who directs him to the SCUMM Bar.

Other changes from the game in this version of the script include whittling down the three trials Guybrush must complete in order to become a pirate to just one. In addition the scrapes with the local pirates on Melée Island are condensed into a single fight with the villain LeChuck’s undead skeleton crew. And Murray the Talking Skull makes an appearance despite not being introduced in the games until the opening of the third entry in the series. Murray figures into the final act of this script where he works together with the island castaway Herman Toothrot and a band of wild monkeys to rescue Guybrush from being thrown into a river of lava from LeChuck’s ship.

After Carson wrote this initial treatment Patty Blau who was becoming head of digital features at ILM at the time paired Carson with a couple of young writers named Corey Rosen and Scott Leberecht. Rosen was a CG artist at ILM and Leberecht was an art director but they were also both filmmakers in their spare time producing films for festivals as well as animated comedy shorts such as The Spirit of Spawn. These two wrote another treatment for the film in order to pitch it to Spielberg and served as screenwriters on the project.

Rosen and Leberecht’s treatment deviated even further from the game. It followed Guybrush searching for the treasure of Monkey Island in order to pay his union fees and become a mighty pirate. As he leaves the SCUMM Bar he bumps into Elaine Marley at the docks on Melee Island and the two begin to talk. Marley is setting off to find her younger brother Kitt who was shipwrecked on Monkey Island and Guybrush needs a ship to take him to the treasure. Elaine is reluctant at first but then some henchmen appear on orders from LeChuck who has been tracking Elaine to make her his undead bride. The two escape and the rest of the film follows Guybrush and Elaine exploring Monkey Island and evading LeChuck and his crew: They find Kitt among a tribe of monkeys Elaine is kidnapped and Guybrush defeats LeChuck dousing the pirate in molten lava. This was the script that ILM pitched to Spielberg.

“[We] flew down to Amblin with Patty Blau and we met with Steven” says Carson. “The first thing he said to me was ‘I told George years ago that he should make Monkey Island into a film’ so I knew I had a pretty easy pitch ahead of me. After [that] Steven suggested that Patty meet with two of the Amblin producers to see if we could work something out.”

“The meeting ended the way you want those meetings to end” Rosen says. “It was like shaking hands like Let’s make the movie. I remember very clearly Dave Carson as we were getting back in the car goes ‘You can trace the decline of your entire career from this moment. It’s never going to get better than Steven Spielberg shaking your hand.’”

Asked who he had in mind for the voice of the characters Carson says “We were far from voice casting on Monkey but I would have definitely considered those who voiced the characters in the games.” That would’ve been Dominic Armato and Earl Boen who voiced Guybrush and LeChuck respectively in 1997’s The Curse of Monkey Island the first Monkey Island game with voice acting.

Charting a new course

The plot changed significantly as the project progressed with Carson and the two writers working with the rest of ILM’s story department to develop the treatment further. This story group included Steve Purcell the creator of adventure game series Sam & Max who was a background artist and collaborator on the first two Monkey Island games as well as storyboard artists such as Delia Gosman Garett Sheldrew and Tony Stacchi. Around this time other LucasArts employees also started to hear news of a Monkey Island film.

“The first I heard of it was when I saw some people I hadn’t seen before in Sean Clark and Mike Stemmle’s office” says Bill Tiller background artist on the game The Curse of Monkey Island. “They were working on Escape from Monkey Island at the time. I guess management figured they should consult though I’m not sure why they didn’t bring Larry Ahern [co-project lead and art director on the game The Curse of Monkey Island] and I in too.” In fact ILM’s story department only held one meeting with LucasArts.

“Sadly I have only vague whispery memories of rumors of a Monkey Island movie over at ILM” says Escape from Monkey Island co-director Mike Stemmle. “I’d be hard-pressed to even recall when I heard such rumors. I do remember seeing some Steve Purcell concept art at one point or another but that’s about it.”

“In retrospect there should have been a lot more interaction. They know this world. They love this world. They were deeply steeped in Monkey Island and we were Hollywood types.”

“In retrospect there should have been a lot more interaction” Rosen says of the relationship between his team and the game developers at LucasArts. “They know this world. They love this world. They were deeply steeped in Monkey Island and we were Hollywood types. We were dicks. We were taking their idea and making a movie of it and we weren’t including them. That’s stupid. That’s not how anything should be done. When you are using source material and you have access to those people that’s dumb that we didn’t do that.”

The one major connection they did have however was Purcell and he proved important. Purcell worked closely with Tony Stacchi throughout development of Monkey Island giving him unique insight into the games.

“I think Steve Purcell was a little frustrated with me because I was like ‘I don’t play video games at all but I love pirates’” says Stacchi. “I like Defoe and Robert Louis Stevenson so I was really into the pirate thing. [...] But I thought everything that I learned and read and the little I played of the game I thought was super clever taking from all that stuff.”

Under this story group the film changed to an original story about the villain LeChuck trying to unite all pirates living and dead under a single terrifying flag. In this version of the story Guybrush is portrayed as a Chum-Bait fisherman living with his pet monkey sidekick Sam. Much like in the earlier scripts it’s his dream to become a mighty pirate so when LeChuck shows up at the local SCUMM Bar recruiting pirates for his ship Guybrush volunteers to join and accidentally becomes embroiled in a plot involving dancing monkeys blood rituals and pirate armadas.

“The story started to take on a different quality” says Rosen. “It became more of a crew more of a gang of pirates that Guybrush recruits [...] so it became less of a solo adventure. Our original script was basically Guybrush and Elaine on a journey and LeChuck [was the bad guy]. It was really simplified; it was like Romancing the Stone. [The new story] was about a young idiot Guybrush Threepwood [who] wants to be a pirate but he doesn’t really know what that is. So our chin-scratching analysis of that for the story was ‘What does it mean to be a pirate?’ Guybrush thinks of piracy as this fun adventure [but then] he crosses over with LeChuck who is actually a demon ... pirate.”

“That’s the part that really resonated with me — to have such a blinkered character who really wants something” says Stacchi. “That’s what I got out of it. And you read the Defoe book on pirates and that stuff is sort of in there. There are all these interesting stories about these guys who were straight-up thugs who turned into pirates but then there’s all these noblemen who became pirates [too]. And that was Guybrush in a fun cartoony nutshell.”

The Pirates of the Caribbean ‘connection’

Two of the most pervasive myths about the Monkey Island film are that Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were writers on the project and that they later recycled many of the elements from the unfinished film for their Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The truth however is much less straightforward.

While the story department was putting the finishing touches on this third draft of the story one of the producers at ILM Kim Bromley started a series of lunchtime interviews where she hosted various professionals from across the film industry. ILM employees were invited to attend and ask questions and the guests would often receive a tour of the offices afterward. According to Carson and Rosen the screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott who later worked on Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and its sequels were among those who visited the studio during this period with Amblin helping to arrange the visit hoping that the two would want to work on a new script for the project.

“They toured ILM and came over to the story group’s offices” says Carson. “We talked with them about films they had developed and we showed them the artwork we were working on for Monkey Island. What we didn’t know was at that time Ted and Terry were developing a script for Disney based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. They weren’t the first writers to tackle this assignment. Disney had several times in the past assigned writers to develop a script based on their ride but no one had achieved a script that the studio put into production.”

Tony Stacchi adds “We pitched them Monkey Island which had artwork for every sequence and there was artwork for all the beats. [...] All I remember from their response was like ‘Look you love pirate movies we love pirate movies nobody in Hollywood is going to make a pirate movie.’ [...] Later [when they announced Pirates of the Caribbean] I remember talking to Jim Morris about it and saying ‘Hey those guys are making a pirate movie and they told us that nobody would make a pirate movie.’ And Jim went ‘Yep and we have all the special effects so it’s a win-win.” ILM went on to win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest in 2006.

Some online have misinterpreted this pitch meeting as proof that the Pirates of the Caribbean writers were involved with the Monkey Island project or that they later transformed it into Pirates of the Caribbean. But this simply isn’t true. The screenwriting duo however has been bombarded with questions about the connection ever since with fans highlighting a resemblance between the films and the games. The pair have always denied any similarities as pure coincidence. For instance in August 2006 Ted Elliott responded to a question on the duo’s screenwriting website Wordplay about whether they had played the Monkey Island games with a forum post titled “Nope”:

But wasn’t the Monkey Island game itself inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean ride? I recall that after the first movie came out someone said we ripped off the “prisoners calling dog with keys” from the game.

Terry Rossio waded in not long afterward addressing other comparisons people were making between Monkey Island’s Voodoo Lady and Tia Dalma a character introduced in the second Pirates of the Caribbean film:

Wow people are strange. I read through some of those posts made by people who are familiar with the game (I’ve not played it but then I’ve not played ANY video game ... I couldn’t get past the first challenge of MYST). Anyway in several posts listed people said stuff like “Wow look at the voodoo lady man that is so similar taken directly from the game.” It seems as though (from what I can glean) that the only similarity between the two characters is that each is a Voodoo Lady. Actually I did always feel less than brilliant on that character — like how Stephen King felt about Abigail in the STAND writing a kind of standard black mystic character from the south a gypsy queen swamp lady voodoo queen etc). The character always felt a bit ‘stock’ (though we worked to make her as unique as we could). Anyway — who would have thought that the choice to create a Voodoo Lady in a pirate film would lead a number of people to think we had to steal that idea from somwhere? I was going to write a horror film with a witch character but now I’m not so sure ...

Despite these protestations the rumor has refused to die with fans and even some former members of LucasArts bringing it up when referring to the canceled Monkey Island film. Asked what he thinks about this Carson makes it clear he doesn’t believe that the visit the writers paid to the studio had any great influence on Pirates of the Caribbean and its future success as a film franchise. Instead he stresses how much he admires the writers and what they accomplished with the character of Jack Sparrow before talking about the joy of getting to meet them and how important their advice was for learning the basics of screenwriting and story structure.

“Their website in those days — we were learning anything we could about story structure” says Carson. “At least I remember reading it all the time. I liked what they had to say and it was great meeting them.” He goes on to echo Elliott’s sentiment: “I also don’t think it really matters. The games were inspired by the rides so if a movie based on the ride is inspired by the games it all seems like good fun to me.”

Tony Stacchi agrees: “The fundamental thing is that the inspiration for all these things is some people were really into the old pirate movies but everybody was inspired by this odd ride at Disneyland that mixed living dead pirates with real pirates and skeletons and it was just this strange little thing. We all just were taking from the same place and honestly any writer who starts working on a pirate movie [...] all these themes of signing your name over signing your soul over that kind of stuff is in the literature so you’re going to end up there.”

Monkey business

LucasArts released the storyboards for this later version of the film in 2011 as part of the Monkey Island Special Edition Collection a retail package containing the modern remakes of the first two Monkey Island games. These storyboards primarily show the art of Tony Stacchi and Steve Purcell with some additional pieces from Garett Sheldrew Delia Gosman and David Carson. But arriving at this story layout had been difficult for the team.

“[Developing the story this far] did not go as smoothly as I would have hoped” says Carson. “Story development is often contentious and it was rare that we all saw things the same way. But we eventually managed to hash out a story that was a good start. The main character [Guybrush Threepwood] was one of the biggest challenges. While his character made a great avatar for the player of the game it was harder to get a lock on who he was as the hero of the film [because he’s not typically heroic and much of his background is left unexplored].”

Beyond the problems of adaptation there were also more troubling concerns. This included a second meeting with Spielberg. Jim Morris Patty Blau Rosen and Tom Bertino (who was going to act as animation supervisor) were all present at this meeting.

“The first meeting was just this little table but now Steven wanted to make the project the table … [imagine] this cartoonishly long conference room where Steven is sitting at one end Tom Bertino is sitting at the other” Rosen recalls. “The funny thing about Hollywood meetings and creative projects when you come up with ideas is you’re like ‘Oh I have this great idea’ and then the committee assembles. All of a sudden this story that everyone was shaking hands on becomes ‘What if we change the main character to a monkey?’”

“We gathered in Steven’s office and the first thing he said was that we shouldn’t have the main characters be human” Carson says. “Instead he suggested we should make the movie be about the monkeys on Monkey Island. Everyone just nodded but my heart stopped. What the heck? We had worked for several weeks on a story that was based on the charm and humor of the games and Steven wanted to throw all that out and make some new story about monkeys? I was completely confused.

“I like to think it wasn’t the project [itself] that didn’t go through” says Stacchi. “I think it was just figuring out ‘Who is going to pay for this?’”

“The next week I met with Jim at ILM and told him I didn’t know where to go with the project” Carson continues. “I didn’t have a script where the monkeys were the main characters and I didn’t really believe that Steven would be interested in financing such a movie. Certainly people who came to see the film because of their love for the games would be disappointed. And it was clear Steven wasn’t ready to finance a film based on our current story.”

Morris told Carson to keep improving and developing the existing treatment realizing that the director was reluctant to make Spielberg’s suggested changes but the project quickly lost steam. The story department continued working on it developing artwork and Rosen finished a screenplay but it never entered production. Instead ILM put the project aside while waiting for the next financial steps to make the film a reality with the team conceptualizing other ideas in the meantime.

“The [Monkey Island] story was in a good place [...] so we just had an open season on pitching ideas” says Rosen. “I had a heist movie that I pitched and developed into a beautiful pitch deck. We had a Tintin project. We just had a really great sort of bench of things.”

“We fell into a routine” Carson says. “We would develop potential story ideas [for different animated feature films] and pitch them to each other once a week. The best ones would be fleshed out with more detail and some art and once a month those would get pitched to the ‘story advisory group.’ We had a number of stories that I think showed promise. I developed a story based on the Arabian Nights. There was a story that involved a number of rats that escape from a lab and meet up with rats living in the streets of New York. There was an idea for a story based on The Five Chinese Brothers. I even pitched A Princess of Mars as an idea. Any of these could arguably be developed into an entertaining film but there was never an idea that the entire advisory group agreed was a surefire hit.”

“I like to think it wasn’t the project [itself] that didn’t go through” says Stacchi. “I think it was just figuring out ‘Who is going to pay for this?’ I think George Lucas and Jim Morris were very willing to do a very decent rate for anybody who wanted to finance the movie just to get in the game of making digital features but it was just too much of a risk.”

In 2001 the story department was dismantled and digital feature development continued under a new department called LFL Animation (Lucasfilm Ltd. Animation). Some continued to work under this new department though many others departed to pursue other opportunities. Among them was Carson who left Lucasfilm and ILM for the chance to work as an art director on a number of James Bond games for Electronic Arts. LFL Animation continued developing feature projects until 2005 but the Curse of Monkey Island film slowly passed into legend among fans of the game.

Six years later ILM finally released its first digital feature Rango in 2011 in collaboration with a number of other studios. Ironically Pirates of the Caribbean series director Gore Verbinski helmed the film.

With time behind them many who were attached to the Monkey Island project as well as individuals who worked on the games at LucasArts say they are disappointed that the film never reached the screen bringing the series to a new audience. But they say it wasn’t for a lack of effort.

Correction: At the end of this story we originally suggested that digital feature development stopped at LucasFilm in 2001.

* * *

Exercise looked a lot different in the 1920s especially where women were concerned. If you didn’t have an exercise bicycle — which you used in your regular clothes — you probably did bodyweight exercises. Building strength using barbells and dumbbells was going strong according to Women’s Health Magazine. Boxing was a “means of keeping that schoolgirl figure” too.

On April 25 1920 The World-Herald reported that about 800 women and girls were participating in a physical fitness program hosted by the YWCA in demonstration of its slogan “Health is the habit of life.”

“After the entrance march will come a dumbbell exercise by the matrons’ class followed by a relay race of junior pupils” the article said. The participants ranged from age 3 to 65.

Here’s a look at other medical and health happenings back in the day.

1920

Oct. 8: McKenney Dentists places an ad in The World-Herald boasting that “perfect teeth make physical fitness.” “To win in anything the body and brain must be nourished in a proper manner — to do this the mouth must function rightly and this cannot be done with bad teeth.” The office is at 14th and Farnam Streets.

1921

Edward Mellanby discovers that lack of vitamin D in the diet causes rickets.

Earle Dickson invents the Band-Aid at a table in his home. It’s out of necessity because after several weeks of kitchen accidents his bride Josephine clearly needs a way to easily cover her cuts and burns. Earle prepared some ready-made bandages by placing squares of cotton gauze at intervals along an adhesive strip and covering them with crinoline. Josephine simply had to cut a length of the strip and wrap it over her wound. Earle told his boss at Johnson & Johnson about his invention and a trademark product was soon in mass production.

1922

Jan. 11: Insulin is first used to treat diabetes. Before 1921 it was exceptional for people with Type 1 diabetes to live more than a year or two. One of the 20th century’s greatest medical discoveries remains the only effective treatment for people with the disease today. A 14-year-old boy who lay dying at a hospital in Toronto was given the first injection of insulin. The boy suffered a severe allergic reaction. Twelve days later a second improved dose completely eliminated the glycosuria sign of the disease. Sir Frederick G. Banting Charles H. Best and JJR Macleod who made the discovery went from bed to bed injecting an entire ward with their lifesaving breakthrough.

1923

A vaccine is developed for diphtheria a bacterial infection that’s “the kiss of death” in children. Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute in Paris discovers that when the diphtheria toxin is exposed to formaldehyde and heated it becomes nontoxic yet can stimulate active immunity like a vaccine. By October 1925 the new toxoid is ready for clinical trials in Ontario. It’s the mid-1930s before Americans are comfortable with its use in sparing children of the respiratory infection.

Feb. 7: Dean Irving S. Cutter of the Nebraska Medical College tells an annual gathering of nurses that Omaha should spend more on public health. “I am chagrined to read statistics showing that Omaha spends less per capita for public health than any other city of her rank in this country.”

1924

May 4: Dr. Ernest T. Manning director of health supervision of the Omaha Public Schools says the public is eager for authentic information on the care of the body. “It only remains for the medical profession to discard some of the antiquated ideas which have persisted due to our mystical reverence for an obsolete code of ethics.” He says parents and teachers are eager for help in understanding health problems.

1925

May 5: The World-Herald publishes an editorial opposing a dietitian’s proposal for a “fat tax.” It’s Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters who suggests taxing people over a certain weight standard to help force a reduction in “the great American waist line.” The editorial criticizes “those disgustingly slender persons who profess to believe man’s chief mission on earth is diet and exercise.”

1926

First vaccine is developed for whooping cough.

1927

First vaccine is developed for tuberculosis.

First vaccine is developed for tetanus.

1928

Sir Alexander Fleming discovers penicillin. It’s the first drug of its type to attack a wide range of bacteria and changes the face of medicine. Its use during World War II changes the fight against bacterial infections in wounded Allied soldiers lowering death rates from 18% to 1%. Penicillin is so valuable that there are fears of the drug falling into Nazi hands. According to the Washington Post during the Blitz bombings that shattered England Oxford scientists rubbed their coats with the mold knowing that spores would live for a long time on fabric. That way if they were captured or had to travel in a hurry they could extract and regrow it.

Things like slavery. Or putting out ads that we don't like. Uh there's a pretty wide spectrum when we're talking about bad stuff companies do. Here's a look at just a little of all that awful stuff ...

1. Philip Morris

Smoking kills which is bad. In particular it can be bad for the economy which is why the Czech Republic seemed ready to crack down on smoking in 1999. So Phillip Morris commissioned a study that basically said ""Actually people smoking saves the government money."" Because so many people die before they become a burden.

2. Walmart

Realizing that employees drive home at the end of each day Walmart tried to get them to deliver goods in addition to their other jobs. With their own cars own gas and own insurance. For $2 per delivery. Workers were not keen to sign on.

3. Universal Pictures

Why is Hollywood the moviemaking capital? Because at the start of the 20th century Thomas Edison owned patents on moviemaking and Universal didn't want to pay him. So they went as far west as they could to escape the long arm of the law.

4. Amazon

Warehouses are famously backbreaking. But you may be especially disgusted to learn how Amazon has tried convincing workers that they're not working: by making labor into a video game. Electronic panels in the warehouse aisles run programs called MissionRacer and CastleCrafter registering employee tasks and pitting them against each other multiplayer-style.

5. Chiquita

In addition to their more well-known history of creating an actual coup and civil war in Guatemala Chiquita has funded several terrorist groups. It took the US fining them $25 million to convince them to stop.

7. Atlas Logistics

When someone pooped on the warehouse floor -- not a great situation to have to deal with to be fair -- Atlas Logistics made employees submit DNA samples so they could track down the culprit. This is illegal and two workers who sued won $2.2 million.

8. Breitbart

One representative story to sum up Breitbart's commitment to the truth: In 2014 they reported that attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch had represented the Clintons over the Whitewater scandal. They were mixing her up with a different woman with the same name. So they issued a correction ... but left the original false statement as the article's headline.

9. UPMC

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center heard that many employees were complaining about low wages which meant they couldn't afford food for Thanksgiving. So they offered a solution: an employee food bank. Food would be donated by other employees.

10. Minnetonka

In the 1970s the company Minnetonka wanted to patent liquid soap. This was impossible because they hadn't invented it. So Minnetonka did the next best thing and bought up all 100 million plastic pumps available for soap dispensers. No other companies could make them and Minnetonka had a monopoly.

11. Ashley Furniture

Something seemed strange about this furniture chain. With 1000 injuries among just 4500 people in three years this was enough that the government fined them a couple million. Apparently the factory had a problem with ensuring chopping machines were off before letting fingers come nearby.

12. Range 702

In 2014 a Nevada gun range let a nine-year-old girl handle an Uzi submachine gun. Unable to brace against the gun's recoil she fatally shot the instructor. This gun range was not Range 702 which we're calling out today. Range 702 was the neighboring gun range who responded to the shooting by saying they still welcome children: ""It's an adrenaline rush for sure.""

15. A-1 Pictures

In case you needed another reason to avoid anime animators are paid by the frame which can force them into working ludicrous hours. One worker made headlines after putting in 600 hours in a month. That data comes from the hospital that treated him shortly before he killed himself.

16. HubSpot

When email marketing company HubSpot fired people it sent everyone else an email saying the laid-off employee would be ""using his superpowers in his next big adventure"" and threw a ""graduation"" party. They finally dispensed with this admitting the practice was ""disrespectful and misleading.""

17. Verizon

Along with buying the domain Verizon.com Verizon bought VerizonSucks.com just in case someone wanted to create a site about how much they suck. So someone who hated Verizon instead went and registered VerizonReallySucks.com. Verizon sued saying (falsely) that this was a trademark violation.

18. Goodwill

Goodwill pays some workers 41 cents per hour. It is legal to pay disabled workers this amount under a standard called the ""subminimum wage."" Proponents of the subminimum wage say that without it companies would not hire disabled workers at all.

19. American Express

In the '60s Anthony De Angelis claimed to control Italy's entire vegetable oil industry. As proof he said American Express vouched for him -- and they did because he paid them to. He used their backing to swindle investors out of $200 million claiming his warehouses were filled with valuable salad oil. They actually held seawater.

21. Amy's Baking Company

This place is mostly famous because Gordon Ramsay walked out of it calling the owners too rude even for him. It forbade employees from talking to each other saying doing so ""may result in possible harm."" It also confiscated all tips.

22. Listerine

Listerine was designed as a surgical antiseptic which has limited market reach. So the company invented the disease halitosis -- which is not in fact a disease though the word existed to describe bad breath -- and told people Listerine cures it. The ruse worked.

23. Washington Football Team

Back when the team was trying to dodge criticism for its ""Redskins"" name owner Dan Snyder decided to invite Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly to sit beside him for a game. This might have fooled some people. But not the Navajo who had in fact already voted Shelly out ... for previously associating with Snyder.

24. Beech-Nut Packing

This bacon seller back in the 1930s wanted people buying more bacon so they asked an ad company to sell it as a breakfast food. Using some misleading questions they got thousands of doctors to agree that eggs and bacon made for a healthy breakfast.

25. SunTrust

Layoffs are always bad sure. But SunTrust bank went a step further and after laying off employees asked them to be available to work for two more years for no pay. This was illegal and they had to drop the plan when the story went public.

26. DuPont

DuPont knew perfluorooctanoic acid was poisonous. They were warned then they confirmed it first with animal tests then with human ones. They still pumped hundreds of tons of the stuff into rivers and rubbed the stuff in their workers' faces resulting in thousands of lawsuits.

Sales were low for Chivas Regal until they decided to rebrand themselves as a premium whiskey. How? By suddenly jacking up the price without actually changing the beverage at all.

29. Yahoo

Yahoo and many other tech companies pay to freeze employees' eggs long-term so you can delay having children till your infertile years. Sounds generous right? They actually do that because they calculated it costs the company less than providing daycare.

30. Takata

In 2016 the US ordered Takata to recall their airbags from 64 million cars. Airbags that could sometimes explode debris into people's faces. Takata went on using the same basic type of bag though leading to new explosions and new recalls in the years that followed.

31. The Pan-American Coffee Bureau

This coffee consortium tricked Americans into thinking coffee is the default beverage by inventing the coffee break. Coffee breaks never made any sense -- at work you're usually welcome to drink coffee even if you're not on break -- but they made them a thing.

32. The Defeat Diabetes Foundation

We could do a whole list just of charities who spend surprisingly little from donations on their cause. Let's highlight the Defeat Diabetes Foundation which the FTC noted spends approximately zero percent of its proceeds on actually fighting diabetes.

33. Eli Lilly

To boost Prozac sales in 2002 Eli Lilly obtained a confidential list of patients suffering from depression and sent them all a free month's supply. Without doctors vetting the process the drugs found their way to people like a 16-year-old who actually didn't suffer from depression and someone who responded to the Prozac with a violent psychotic reaction.

The government could easily prepare your tax return themselves since they know how much you owe. But they make you do it thanks to lobbying from tax preparers like Turbo Tax. As part of the lobbying deal Turbo Tax has to file taxes for some people for free but they bury that feature where you probably won't find it.

39. State Farm

In the '80s State Farm kept a list of 240 lawyers with orders that anytime a claim came in from one of them the agency had to deny it and investigate further no matter how straightforward it seemed. They ended up paying a $30 million settlement when someone pointed out the only apparent connection between the lawyers: They were all Jewish.

40. 7-Eleven

A bunch of 7-Eleven franchises found a new source of labor: smuggling immigrants into the country illegally. And then paying them only $3 an hour making them work 100-hour weeks. And also deducting from that salary rent since they had to live in housing the owners provided.

42. WaterSaver

This Chicago company used keycards to track how long each employee spent in the bathroom and if an employee spent a whole day without going they rewarded them with a $1 gift card. We don't know if this story is better or worse when you learn WaterSaver deals in plumbing.

43. American Future Systems

To keep employees out of the bathroom you can also use the stick instead of the carrot. American Future Systems had to pay $1.75 million in a lawsuit after forcing employees to clock out before each time they took a piss.

44. Tyson Foods

The most extreme bathroom choice though involves just keeping workers out of the bathroom permanently. How? Make them all wear diapers. This would be disgusting at any company but especially bad at a place like Tyson Foods where those workers shitting themselves are packaging chicken products.

45. Nestle

Nestle has a famously evil history of selling places' water back to them but at least bottled water doesn't kill people. Their campaigns to sell baby formula in underdeveloped countries have killed people -- women who'd otherwise breastfeed mixed powdered formula with unsanitary water and poisoned babies.

46. De Beers

In the 19th century we discovered so many new diamond deposits that the mineral was no longer rare or valuable. Se De Beers formed to buy up every single diamond deposit in the world so they could control the supply and fix prices. Executives had to avoid U.S. soil for decades to escape being arrested.

47. Betty Crocker

When Betty Crocker introduced a cake mix mothers rejected it reasoning that instant food isn't real cooking. So Betty Crocker introduced a new mix that asked you to add one egg. This was needless (the old mix used powdered egg just fine) but it tricked mothers into thinking they were doing real baking after all.

49. General Electric

GE pioneered a way of evaluating employees called ""stack rankings."" It assigns workers a score from 1 to 5 -- and for every person who gets 5 one person must get a 1. Turns out forcing managers to pick favorites and un-favorites is a lot better than plain rewarding performance at encouraging racism and sexism.

50. Coca-Cola

Coke introduced a program in restaurants called ""Cap the Tap"" which they claimed was a campaign against wasting water. It was actually a campaign to convince restaurants to stop serving tap water and serve Coca-Cola instead.

51. McDonald's

A McDonald's started giving employees debit cards attached to a bank account instead of just giving them paychecks. Convenient for employees who don't have their own accounts right? Withdrawing cash from the account costs $5 per transaction.

52. Shell

Shell has been pumping oil out of Nigeria for decades. On top of accepted stuff like bulldozing villages and spilling oil all over vegetation we have to highlight 1995 which was when they ordered the military to torture and kill nine environmental activists.

53. Alka-Seltzer

Alka-Seltzer realized they could sell twice as much if they convinced everyone to double the amount that they used. They introduced a new campaign with the tagline ""plop plop fizz fizz."" Drop two tablets in the glass urged the ads. So people did for no good reason.

54. Cabin Creek Mine

In 1912 the United Mine Workers went on strike. So the Cabin Creek Mine company in West Virginia brought in armored trains to the tent town the workers had set up and gunned 50 workers down. Things got even crazier in the 1920s when the mines now backed up by Army aircraft fought thousands of union members in a battle that used a million bullets.

Mississippi Clarion Ledger

Efforts to restore power in Mississippi were progressing Sunday according to power outages reported by both Entergy and PowerOutage.US.

Statewide all utilities showed 28366 energy customers were without power across the state at 4:25 p.m. Sunday down from about 71000 at 11 a.m. Saturday according to data from PowerOutage.US. That included 4304 in Hinds County 49 in Rankin County and 229 in Madison County.

As of 4:40 p.m. Sunday there were 10894 Entergy customers without power according to Entergy's power outage map down from about 34000 Saturday morning. Entergy services customers in 45 of Mississippi’s 82 counties.

Most Entergy electricity customers in Mississippi should have services restored by the beginning of next week Entergy Mississippi President and CEO Haley Fisackerly said during a virtual press conference Friday.

More than 2000 linemen and other personnel have been enlisted to help restore power in Mississippi including workers from Tennessee Alabama Florida Arkansas Kansas Missouri Illinois Kentucky and Canada.

As power is restored across the state Fisackerly cautioned customers to slowly phase in use to avoid overloading the system. He suggested turning off major appliances ahead of power being turned back on.

""I know when those lights come back on you're going to be ready to clean up that house and wash those dishes in your dishwasher or wash your clothes"" he said. ""Do that in stages. That could create problems back on the grid but also it's not good for your home to ... overload your breakers.""

Entergy Louisiana Winter Storm Update – 2/20/21 @ 3 p.m.

02/20/2021

Warmer temperatures Saturday helped improve travel conditions for crews who are continuing to make significant progress restoring power where it is safe to do so after the second ice storm to cross Louisiana in less than a week heavily impacted the central and northern regions of the state.

At 3 p.m. approximately 19600 Entergy customers in Louisiana were without power most being in the hardest-hit areas south of I-20. The second winter storm brought freezing rain and ice Wednesday and into Thursday causing widespread damage to the company’s electric system in central and north Louisiana.

Since the initial storm on Monday damage assessment personnel have found approximately 230 poles 180 transformers and 1750 spans of wire that were damaged and either in need of repair or replacement statewide. Much like in south Louisiana earlier this week scouts have found numerous downed power lines due to ice accumulation and fallen trees and limbs in the northern portion of the state.

Crews are making repairs setting new poles and installing new wire and equipment as far west as Natchitoches Parish and as far east as Madison Parish. With damage being widespread crews expect restoration to continue into Monday in some of the hardest-hit areas of Avoyelles Caldwell Catahoula Grant Ouachita and Richland parishes.

Entergy’s reliability coordinator Mid-Continent Independent Service Operator has canceled its directive to conserve electricity but continues monitoring the demand for electric power with the available supply. Customers who have lost power can help restoration crews by unplugging electric heating and appliances and plugging them back in gradually once power has been restored. This will help avoid placing instantaneous demand on the electric system and causing additional damage or recurring power outages.

“This has been tough week for many of our communities across Louisiana but we’re getting closer to seeing light at the end of the tunnel” said John Hawkins vice president of distribution operations for Entergy in Louisiana. “Our restoration workforce is making significant progress but there’s still work to do. We know that when you reach for the switch you want the lights to come on and we’re working as quickly and safely as possible to make that happen.”

Customers should remain prepared:

Charge up mobile devices and back-up batteries.

Download the Entergy app to sign up for text updates.

Review guidance at Entergy Storm Center.

If you have medical equipment that requires electricity to properly function take necessary steps to secure an alternative source of electricity in the event of a power disruption.

Have an emergency kit including flashlights medicine first aid water and food.

Safety is our number one priority. If you lose power:

Stay away from downed power lines and assume they are energized. Report them to 1-800-9OUTAGE.

Report your power outage online to Entergy Louisiana or call 1-800-9OUTAGE. There is no need to speak with a customer service representative to report an outage if completed online.

If you have a portable generator use it safely. DO NOT run it in an enclosed space. If connecting to the whole house do so only if the connection has been installed by a licensed electrician to prevent back feed on to the distribution system.

Do not open your refrigerator or freezer door. Food will stay cold much longer this way. If outside temperature is below freezing consider placing food in an ice chest outside.

Please stay clear of linemen as they work to safely restore power

Customers without power can help in the restoration process by turning off major appliances but leaving on a lamp or other light to indicate when power is restored. Then gradually turn other appliances to spread out the increase in power usage over a longer time.

Conserve Electricity:

Remember that extreme cold can drive increased electricity consumption. Follow these easy steps to reduce consumption and lower your usage:

Heating can account for as much as 55% of your monthly electric bill. Setting the thermostat to 68 degrees in the winter is an easy way to reduce how much energy you use. Every degree above 68 on the thermostat can increase your bill by about 3%.

Conserve hot water. Wrap your electric water heater with a water heater blanket that can be found at local home improvement stores and set the thermostat to 120 degrees or medium.

Keep all doors and windows closed. Constant traffic will let out the warm air forcing your heater to work harder to keep the room at the set temperature.

Ensure fans are turning the right way. Fans should be run at a low speed clockwise during the winter. This helps keep the cold air from blowing down on you.

Keep the air circulating. Don’t block heat registers or air returns with curtains or furniture.

Leverage the sun. During the day open your curtains and blinds to let in the warm sunlight. Close them at night to reduce heat loss.

STORM RESTORATION PROCESS

Following a storm we deploy scouts to assess damage. Our scouts work as quickly and safely as possible in sometimes very dangerous conditions. As damages are assessed we will communicate with you the conditions found along with an estimated restoration time and our progress toward restoring your power. We ask for your patience and please know restoring your power safely and quickly is our top priority.

As we assess the damage we will begin restoring service where it is deemed safe to do so.

STAY INFORMED

We continuously keep our communities informed throughout a storm using the following channels:

CONROE Texas — A Conroe family whose young son died during the winter storm has enlisted to help of high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee in their lawsuit against ERCOT and Entergy.

The lawsuit alleges gross negligence by the power grid operator and the electricity provider saying it led to the death of 11-year-old Christian Pavon.

The boy died Tuesday after spending the night in his frigid mobile home that lost power.

The lawsuit says Christian died of hypothermia and the family is asking for more than $100 million in damages.

Medical examiners have not yet released his cause of death.

Entergy released the following statement on the lawsuit:

“We are deeply saddened by the loss of life in our community. We are unable to comment due to pending litigation.”

ERCOT also released a statement:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGljazJob3VzdG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMDIvMjAvbGF3c3VpdC1hY2N1c2VzLWVyY290LWVudGVyZ3ktb2YtZ3Jvc3MtbmVnbGlnZW5jZS1hZnRlci1jb25yb2UtYm95LWRpZXMtZHVyaW5nLWZyaWdpZC13ZWF0aGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawsuit accuses ERCOT Entergy of gross negligence after Conroe boy dies during frigid weather,"HOUSTON – A lawsuit accuses the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and Entergy a utility company serving areas north of Harris County of gross negligence after a boy in Conroe died during the subfreezing weather this week.

The law firm of Houston attorney Tony Buzbee is representing the Pineda family in the lawsuit over the death of 11-year-old Cristian Pineda.

Investigators have said they are still trying to determine how Cristian died. They said an autopsy has been completed but they are awaiting the results of other tests before determining a cause of death. They said a carbon monoxide test in the home was negative.

However the family said in the lawsuit they believe temperatures near 10 degrees at their mobile home on Tuesday night which had lost power during the storm led to the boy’s death.

According to court documents provided by Buzbee’s law firm the family said they had huddled into a single room for the night in an effort to stay warm. Cristian’s mother and stepfather were with their baby boy while Cristian shared a bed with his younger brother. Cristian was found unconscious the next morning. The family called 911 and performed CPR but Cristian was already dead.

“Common sense tells you the weather played a part in his death” Buzbee said. “His mother is very adamant clear that he had no underlying conditions whatsoever that would make him particularly vulnerable to cold weather.”

In the lawsuit the family accuses ERCOT and Entergy of failing to warn people of a hazard providing inaccurate and incomplete advice and information to customers and participating in and contributing to acts that caused the incident in question among other things.

“What’s interesting about this whole ordeal is what these power providers and ERCOT knew long before many of us knew it” Buzbee said. “They knew they didn’t have the capacity they knew they had not winterized their sources of power and they put people in a lot of danger.”

The family is seeking $100 million in damages.

Entergy released the following written statement about the lawsuit: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of life in our community. We are unable to comment due to pending litigation.”

KPRC 2 has also asked ERCOT for a statement regarding the lawsuit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vcGVsaWNhbnMvbmV3cy9iZWhpbmQtbnVtYmVycy1wcmVzZW50ZWQtZW50ZXJneS1jZWx0aWNzLXBlbGljYW5zLTIvMjEvMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind the Numbers presented by Entergy: Celtics at Pelicans (2/21/21),"A look at three key numbers related to Sunday’s game at the Smoothie King Center between Boston and New Orleans (2:30 p.m. Central ABC ESPN Radio New Orleans 100.3 FM):

126.8: New Orleans offensive rating over its past five games which ranks third in the NBA since Feb. 12 behind only Dallas (134.5) and Brooklyn (127.7). That’s the good news. The bad news as Stan Van Gundy discussed after Saturday’s practice is that the Pelicans have not been able to capitalize on that prolific offense winning just once during the five-game span. “You only get one win out of it which I think tells you pretty clearly that offense is not the problem” Van Gundy said. “Our offense has been good because we’re doing a great job sharing the ball; Zion (Williamson) Brandon (Ingram) and Lonzo (Ball) are playing at a high level; and we’ve done a really good job playing together. What we are is sort of a 180 from where we were early in the year when we were a good defensive team but (concerned more) about (offense).” On the season New Orleans is the NBA’s seventh-best offensive team (115.1). All six squads ahead of the Pelicans in offense are at least three games over .500 from 16-13 Denver to 24-6 Utah.

5: New Orleans ranking among the 30 NBA teams in both defensive rebounding percentage and points allowed in the paint two positive statistics that belie the team’s struggles at that end of the floor. On Saturday Van Gundy pointed out that the Pelicans are doing well statistically in several defensive categories but three-point defense has been enough of a problem that it’s overwhelming much of the good. New Orleans is also middle of the pack in fast-break points allowed (13th 12.1 per game). In addition to porous three-point defense – the Pelicans rank last at 16.3 makes allowed per game and 29th in percentage – New Orleans has not created turnovers at a high rate (19th). The defense is also second-worst in the NBA in blocks per game (3.8) a hair ahead of Washington. No Pelican averages one block with Ingram coming closest at 26 swats in his 29 games.

1.6: Steals per 36 minutes for Pelicans rookie guard Kira Lewis Jr. who has shown an ability to disrupt opponents and wreak havoc from the weakside of the defense. The ultra-quick lottery pick from Alabama had a four-steal game at Detroit on Feb. 14 and has come up with at least one theft in three of the past four games. Among Pelicans who’ve logged notable minutes Lewis ranks second in steals per minute trailing only Nickeil Alexander-Walker (2.1 steals per 36). Van Gundy on the 19-year-old Lewis: “He reads plays really really well. He’s got great anticipation. He’s quick and has great hands and he’s fearless. He does a good job off the ball. Where his improvement’s got to come defensively – and this is the reverse of what I see normally with young players – is on the ball. Keeping the ball in front of him and being able to pressure the ball a little bit more. Off the ball he’s way ahead of the curve for a young guy.”

Previous game starting lineups

BOSTON (15-14)

Friday win vs. Atlanta

Kemba Walker Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Daniel Theis Tristan Thompson

Notes: This group is 2-1 but has not started consecutive games this season getting the nod Feb. 2 Feb. 9 and Feb. 19. … Boston has already used 16 different starting lineups with the most common going 5-3 and consisting of currently-sidelined Marcus Smart Brown Tatum Theis and Thompson. … Thirteen Boston players have started at least once including once apiece by rookie Payton Pritchard and second-year pros Carsen Edwards Javonte Green and LSU product Tremont Waters.

NEW ORLEANS (12-17)

Friday loss vs. Phoenix

Lonzo Ball Eric Bledsoe Brandon Ingram Zion Williamson Willy Hernangomez

Notes: This group is 0-1. Hernangomez made his first start with New Orleans on Friday the first time he’s been in an NBA first string since 2019 for Charlotte. … Hernangomez became the 10th different Pelicans player to start a game this season. Beyond the five players in the team’s most common starting group only Alexander-Walker has recorded a victory as a starter (Jan. 17 at Sacramento).

Pelicans keys to victory

DYNAMIC DUOS

Boston’s Brown and Tatum along with New Orleans’ Williamson and Ingram represent the only pair of teammates in the NBA who rank in the top 20 of scoring this season. Brown and Tatum are No. 11 and 13 while Williamson and Ingram are a few pegs lower at No. 14 and 19. The future appears to be very bright for both franchises based on the talent and youth of this quartet with the oldest being only 24 (Brown).

NO BOSTON THREE PARTY

New Orleans continues to allow too many three-pointers a costly aspect of Phoenix’s fourth-quarter dominance Friday in the Smoothie King Center. Boston presents another major challenge in this category ranking eighth in the NBA in three-point percentage (37.7). Tatum and Walker make 2.8 treys per game followed by Brown at 2.5.

In 2020 consumers filed more than 280000 complaints about credit reporting issues — more than half of all complaints received last year by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Syed Ejaz a policy analyst for Consumer Reports.

The number of credit-reporting complaints more than doubled from 2019 according to the agency’s online complaint database.

“They certainly have ballooned over the past year” Mr. Ejaz said.

Credit report errors have long been a problem for American consumers. Accuracy matters because the contents of your credit report help determine whether you can qualify for loans and credit cards and what interest rate you’ll pay.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The State agency wanted the court to allow filing of an appeal out of the stipulated timelines so that it can challenge the orders that barred it from demolishing or interfering with the high-end estate built by Superior Homes (Kenya) PLC.

But the court found that the real estate developer had already lodged a separate appeal against the same High Court judgment and allowing WRA to file another case would be a duplication.

“It is unnecessary to extend time to file the record of appeal as the WRA is at liberty to raise the issues it intends to raise in the cross-appeal which has already been filed. Extending time would only result in duplication” said Justice Hannah Okwengu.

In urging court to extend time WRA explained that the delay to file the appeal was partly due to the closing down of the court as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. It had also told the judge that the intended appeal is arguable and raises matters of public interest.

The State agency wants the appellate court to overturn a judgment by Environment and Lands Court dated November 8 2019 which declared that the residential estate does not encroach on riparian reserve.

Justice Oscar Angote noted that Rule 116(2) of the Water Resources Management Rules confines the definition of riparian land to the entire width of the water course plus an additional minimum distance of six meters up to a maximum of 30 meters on either side of the river bank.

He said at the time the real estate company acquired the suit property measuring 152 acres and started constructing houses in 2008 the riparian reserve of Stoney Athi River to the perimeter wall was and “is beyond the minimum required distance of six metres”.

“The determinant distance of a minimum of six metres and a maximum of 30 metres is from the banks of a river which actually represents the channel of a river in its normal flow. Until the Water Resources Inspector determines otherwise the total area covered by riparian land remains relatively constant across a river” said the judge.

The case started after WRA marked some houses within the estate and a perimeter wall for demolition following flooding in March and May 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Vegas local Cynthia Baer says believe it.

""This actually happens to people! It happened to me"" she said.

A frustrated worker might actually spit in your food.

Here's Baer's story: she's a single mom selling her handmade masks on Etsy to help make ends meet. She says she needs to stay home and help her young children with online school.

""We live such a careful lifestyle. We stay home. We wear masks if we're out. We hand sanitize we wash our hands we do curbside pickups we do school at home"" she said.

On Dec. 22 Baer says she drove through her local McDonald's an independently-owned franchise on Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard to treat the kids to some fries and a strawberry shake.

""And I like to get a coffee - an iced sugar-free French vanilla latte to be exact"" Baer said.

But that day her usual drive-thru experience turned out to be anything but.

""She (drive-thru employee) cut me off halfway through my order and I said I'm not done ordering. I want to still order my drink. And she goes well it's too late to order"" Baer said.

Baer said she asked to speak with a supervisor: ""And he said he would take care of it and to pull forward and they would get my order. And then they said which I thought was curious your drink's not ready so you need to go to the third window.""

Curious but not yet concerned she says she drank the iced coffee only to get a nasty surprise when she was nearly finished.

""I felt that texture -- it's a slimy jelly-like texture in your mouth. And you know what that is and it's definitely not coffee. I could see there was a lot more in the bottom of the cup and it was a pretty large amount that was in my mouth"" Baer said.

Her coffee contained mucous and saliva according to Baer that she believed came from the McDonald's employee she had words within the drive-thru.

""To me it's like a threat to your life. It really is. We're all walking around wearing masks social distancing not going to school working from home and this person has the audacity to spit directly into something that you're going to drink! It is so dangerous!"" Baer said.

So she says she immediately called McDonald's to report that her drink had been tampered with.

""It seemed like either they didn't care or they didn't believe it. And she (the store manager) said if you can bring me the saliva then you can make a statement if you want to. She did ask for pictures also"" Baer said.

Baer says she gave McDonald's the photos they requested along with the rest of the spit that was in her drink.

""I'm sorry you had to deal with that on that end of things and I know from our side of the claim process getting information from McDonald's was not the speediest by any means"" said an insurance adjuster working for McDonald's in a phone call recorded by both sides.

The insurance adjuster told Baer about the surveillance video of the incident: ""The angle's not very clear but she acknowledged it so to me video or not she said she did that.""

""I felt violated!"" Baer said. ""I felt absolutely violated and I had concerns about what you could potentially get from ingesting someone's spit. Here you have a frontline restaurant worker who is choosing to be reckless knowing they are at very high risk for COVID.""

Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Asher Shahzad calls the employee's actions ""unacceptable and absolutely reckless.""

""If you check anybody's saliva you will probably find let's say close to 50 or maybe 100 or thousands of germs right at that moment"" Shahzad said.

And Baer says it got worse.

""I realized that I was having symptoms from COVID. I got very sick got tested and it was positive"" she said.

Baer tested positive for COVID on Dec. 27 five days after drinking the contaminated coffee.

There's no way of knowing if it came from the coffee but in her call with the insurance company she said she brought it up.

""I got COVID from it"" Baer said to the agent. ""Besides drinking someone's mucous.""

""And that's like the vast majority of it. Usually with someone who slips and breaks their arm it's usually really straightforward. With this I don't even know where to start to be completely honest"" the agent said to Baer. ""I'm willing to work with you.""

""The corporate office has offered me two free value meals and the insurance company offered me a $500 settlement"" Baer said.

Baer says she declined that initial offer.

And during the recorded conversation the agent made a second offer: ""I would say right off the bat I'll double it and put it up to $1000.""

Baer says she calls that a slap in the face like I didn't matter.

McDonald's told 13 Investigates that no one was available for an on-camera interview.

However local McDonald’s owner and operator F. Ronald Smith sent the following statement:

“Our number one priority is always the health and safety of our customers and employees. When we learned of the incident we took the appropriate steps necessary to investigate the matter and immediately contacted local health authorities. The employee in question is no longer with our organization. We have also reached out to officials at the Southern Nevada Health District and requested that the department revoke this individual’s Food Handler Card – we sincerely hope they comply with this request.

We pride ourselves on serving safe high quality food and beverages as well as adhering to all applicable local state and federal guidelines and regulations. We have apologized to the customer that we didn’t meet those standards in this unacceptable incident and are taking action to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.”

""McDonald's has got probably the best training system in the world. They train crew they train managers they train owners and operators on food safety as well as other things like managerial control etc. And to have something like this sneak through... There's no excuse for it"" said Tim Moulson.

And he should know. Moulson a certified food safety consultant worked for the McDonald's corporation for 25 years as director of training development and as operations consultant to franchisees.

He's also the past president of the Nevada Food Safety Task Force and currently sits on the Nevada Restaurant Association board.

""This really shocks me"" Moulson said. ""It shocks me and I'm sure it shocks McDonald's.""

He explains that restaurant employees aren't even allowed to eat or drink anywhere near the food preparation area.

""You can't help but have some spittle come out at the time when you're eating and that also can cause a communicable disease"" Moulson said.

Baer says the whole experience has put her on the defensive every time she goes out to eat.

""You don't know what they're doing back there. You don't know if they're tampering with your food or not"" Baer said.

And she says she hopes her story raises awareness and standards for all.

""Everyone is shocked by this"" said Darcy Spears. ""No one more than me"" Baer replied.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9kYW5pZWxsZWhlYWx5L3Byb2R1Y3RzLXRvLW1heGltaXplLXNwYWNlLWluLXlvdXItc21hbGwta2l0Y2hlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,34 Products To Maximize Space In Your Small Kitchen,We hope you love our recommendations!

One area of the store we’ll never get enough of? The bakery section. TBH it’s basically like a sweet wonderland that features muffins cookies and a lot more. And recently Costco just restocked a decadent bakery item that we’re obsessed with: cinnamon pull-a-part rolls. It’s a fan-favorite treat and if you have yet to try it for yourself trust us when we say it is every bit as chewy rich and delicious as you’d hope.

“Costco’s heavenly Cinnamon Pull-A-Part is back at the bakery and I’m ALL about it!! 🤤” wrote @costcobuys. They added “These are made with sweet dough brown sugar cinnamon and a cream cheese icing! If you haven’t tried this yet you HAVE TO!”

Costco fans are raving about the rolls in the comments. One user simply wrote “Must have 🙌” while another commenter said “These should be illegal they are so good!”

They sound like bliss and we can’t wait to get our hands on these. Of course homemade cinnamon rolls are amazing but they’re also labor- and time-intensive to make and Costco’s easy bakery-made alternative gives us the family-friendly decadent breakfast or brunch item without all of the work. And at an unbeatable price of $6.99 you really can’t go wrong by popping one or two of these in your cart on your next trip.

While members of Dartmouth’s Brownie Troop 67087 would normally hold group sales outside of stores like Walmart or bring their boxes door-to-door the pandemic has made it so the scouts have to think of new sales options.

Instead of the normal table Troop Leader Rebecca Dutra and her eight-year-old daughter and scout Sophia sold the cookies in a trunk-or-treat-style booth at the Dartmouth Police station parking lot on Tucker Road.

“We’re just trying to keep the Girl Scout tradition alive” Rebecca Dutra said.

According to Dutra turnout has been “pretty decent” at the police station. She noted that even amidst Friday’s snowfall she and Sophia were still able to sell around 36 boxes.

“Not bad at all” Dutra said.

Police officers have been known to grab a box or two she added with one officer inspiring nearby Eversource workers to start buying cookies when they first got their shipment.

“[Sophia] ended up selling like 20 boxes just that one morning” Dutra said. “That was pretty neat.”

According to Sophia Dartmouth’s finest tend to favor Thin Mints.

“They smell so minty — that’s gross” she said adding that her favorites are lemon and the new french toast-inspired Toast-yay. “The lemon smells really good and the toasted smell is awesome sauce.”

The drive-thru booths have been held over the weekends and last around half an hour since her daughter is “still little” said Dutra.

“I’m not little” Sophia responded.

To keep busy during any downtime Dutra said the two of them will play hand games or sing together. But when customers arrive Sophia is all business — making sure to ask customers how many boxes and then promptly doing the math to make change.

The eight-year-old added that she doesn’t mind doing the counting noting that math is her favorite class at Quinn School.

“In first grade it was easy” Sophia said. “Second grade — still easy.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

But every once in a while one comes along that seems to be exactly what you want.

Photo: nuCamp RV

Photo: nuCamp RV

What you see in the cover photo is known as the Tab 400 teardrop camper from nuCamp RV. You've heard of this team before here on Autoevolution. They produce a wide range of other vehicles including short and long bed campers. As for teardrop campers this is the first one I've seen from the team. The time has come for you to take a trip and find out what they ‘ve put together for you.In order to get an idea of its size I'm going to throw some spec sheet data at you. Now what you see has more than one available floorplan to choose from two in total. The only difference between the two is 10 lb (4.5 kg) of weight and a bedding option. Everything else in terms of size  remains the same.A total exterior length of 18.25 ft (5.5 m) width of 7.5 ft (2.2 m) and height of 8.66 ft (2.63 m) offers more than enough space to fit necessities unseen in other teardrop campers. Oh there’s also an interior height of 6.6 ft (2.01 m) to give you enough clearance as you move throughout the vehicle. All in all these dimensions and construction create a towable with a dry weight of 2876 lb (1304 kg).Inside however the Tab may be a little different than what you're used to for vehicles of this category. Most campers like this don't really have enough room to include a bathroom bedroom kitchen and dining room all at once. Not the case with the Tab.This is really what sets this towable apart from others; the number of amenities found inside. As you enter the camper immediately to the right is a dining area that also couples as an extra sleeping area. Pretty normal so far nothing out of the ordinary. Immediately to the left you'll find a fully equipped kitchenette with 2-burner stove fridge and a sink that’s hooked up to the waterworks. Already the Tab is starting to show off a bit.Behind the kitchenette the next area available is the bedroom. Depending on the floor plan you choose different bedding options exist. One option includes a bed suitable for two guests while the other includes a bed fit only for one. All along this space you will also find plenty of storage options for clothes goods and the like. Under-bed storage is the main benefit here.Finally the one feature that we rarely see in a teardrop camper is a bathroom. Between the bedroom and the dining area at the front sits a space where many a humans go to meditate the wet bath with fold-down sink and toilet. There's also a side window to let in natural light and all water is managed through a Nautilus system.One thing the Tab 400 does offer is a huge array of options to make your trip more comfortable. This includes everything from air conditioning to acrylic dual pane windows 3 speed fan Alde heating systems exterior shower and even solar panels.

Minister of Labour Joseph Hamilton on Sunday warned ExxonMobil and its contractors as well as other oil companies against paying Guyanese less than their foreign counterparts for the same jobs.

“I will deal with that issue because we have heard several issues that for whatever reason they are in our space and they bring people here and they are paying foreigners five times and ten times more than Guyanese” Mr. Hamilton said.

Addressing a meeting of Chinese business owners at the Chinese Association headquarters Brickdam Georgetown he said he has already put the American supermajor oil company ExxonMobil on notice that they and their subcontractors must desist from such an alleged practice. “I have said to ExxonMobil that they have a duty to their subcontractors an obligation rather to ensure that their subcontractors who operate in this space they follow law because when you talk oil and gas the only name that comes up with Guyanese people is ExxonMobil” he said.

About three years ago a number of Guyanese seafarers had complained to then David Granger-led administration and the Guyana Human Rights Association about not being hired by a sub-contractor and in a number of instances being paid less compared to their counterparts from Trinidad and Tobago and other countries. But Mr. Hamilton who was appointed minister of the recreated Labour Ministry after his People’s Progressive Party (PPP) was declared winner of the March 2 2020 general and regional elections said workers in Guyana would have to be paid the same wages and salaries. “I would not allow it whereby we grade people based on ethnic origin or based on where they belong. I have said that to the major oil companies and that is a special project. It is only time” he said.

Mr. Hamilton also urged Guyanese not to discriminate against workers based on their ethnicity or country of origin. “Once a worker that is in this space called Guyana they have to be treated based on the labour laws based on the Cooperative Republic of Guyana whether they speak Spanish Portuguese or Mandarin; that is what the law says and we hope that everyone pays attention to the law” he said.

The Labour Minister said his ministry has over the past several months increased enforcement arms by increasing the number of Occupational Safety and Health Officers and Labour Officers to ensure businesses comply with the relevant laws.

Businesses would be expected to make fair returns on their investment but according to him not by business owners breaking the law.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9waG90b3Mvc3R1ZGVudHMtd2l0aC1kaXNhYmlsaXRpZXMtY29tcGxldGUtc3RlbS1yb2JvdGljcy10cmFpbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students with disabilities complete STEM robotics training,"Twenty-six students with disabilities recently received certificates after completing a Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) robotics training course facilitated by the Guyana Council of Organisations for Persons with Disabilities (GCOPD) in partnership with ExxonMobil Guyana.

According to a press release yesterday from the GCOPD a simple ceremony was held at the auditorium of the David Rose Special Education Needs (SEN) School where each participant was presented with a certificate while the outstanding participants were presented with “3D” printed medals.

The participants also displayed the robots they built during the programme.

The release noted that another ceremony is scheduled for 27 other course participants.

Speaking at the event GCOPD Programme Coordinator Ganesh Singh expressed gratitude to ExxonMobil Guyana for funding the programme which has been in the pipelines for more than two years. He also express-ed gratitude to the members of the University of Guyana Robotics Club (UGRC).

The release noted that the STEM programme for children with disabilities was piloted in five SEN schools in Region Four.

It explained that during the four-month course the children were exposed to the STEM subjects using robotic technology and they were also taught complex concepts using the technology to help them to develop critical-thinking and problem-solving skills.

The participants also developed a higher level of environmental awareness since the robotic kits were solar powered and utilized recyclable materials for the construction of the robots the release added.

Each participant was given a tablet computer and a robotic kit.

A new telecommunications company Canje Tel plans to invest US$200 million in a subsea fibre-optic cable to mainly serve the offshore oil and gas operations and remote communities with little or no access to the Internet a top official said Saturday.

Senior Engineer at Canje Tel Raymond Michael Kirton said an application and all supporting documents have been filed with government’s Telecommunications Agency with the hope of securing the licence. He said the Trinidad-based HARCON Group has already secured a US$200 million loan which is on standby to implement the project.

He said the roll-out time-line including maritime mapping would take three years around 2024 “when Guyana would be booming.”

The official explained that the cable would be 16 terabytes with a lifespan of 25 years. “We are looking to capitalise with a brand new cable” he said. Redundancy plans include creating a hub and an earth station he said.

Mr. Kirton said Canje Tel first applied in November 2020 and a few days ago submitted the final documents including proof of application to the Maritime Administration to conduct maritime surveys Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Sea Defence Board.

The company plans to serve the Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSOs) offshore directly in the Atlantic rather than come to shore first and then be rerouted back to the vessels. Mr. Kirton said the cable would land onshore at Now-or-Never Mahaicony with east and west linkages to cater for more oil and oil-related investments. A landing station data and contact centre would also be located there to create employment for the people and “bring some value to the community with the infrastructure.”

“We hope to land a sub-sea fibre optic cable to deliver enterprise level bandwidth to the huge companies like Exxon and all the other companies coming in to Guyana because there will be an increased need for bandwidth” he said.

If approval had been granted four years ago the Canje Tel official said his company would have been able to supply ExxonMobil with the required bandwidth. That American oil major has since decided to run its own fibre-optic cable to its FPSO.

Mr. Kirton said he was buoyed by recent pronouncements by Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo that another fibre-optic cable would be landing in Guyana.

The Canje Tel official said his companies planned to partner with small Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in those communities to supply bandwidth at a “reasonable rate” instead of sourcing from other providers like the Guyana Telephone and Telegraph (GTT).

If Guyana eventually offers 5G service Mr. Kirton said Canje Tel would possibly enter the local phone and mobile data market."

Judge Esther Salas and her husband Mark described their only child Daniel as ""the center of their universe."" A twenty-year-old college sophomore who ""wanted to squeeze the joy out of every situation.""

On July 19 2020 the tight-knit family of three were in the basement cleaning-up from Daniel's birthday party when the doorbell rang at their New Jersey home. Daniel raced up the stairs to respond to a man dressed as a FedEx driver.

Moments later gunshots broke the silence of a quiet suburban street. Daniel shot in the chest lay at the foot of the front door. Mark shot three times was clinging to life on the porch.

Daniel died on the way to the hospital. Mark is still recovering from multiple surgeries.

Daniel Mark and Esther Salas

On Sunday Judge Salas revealed to 60 Minutes harrowing new details about the plot by a former plaintiff to assassinate the judge and possibly others.

""Who knows what could have happened? Salas said to correspondent Bill Whitaker. ""But we need to understand that judges are at risk. We need to understand that we put ourselves in great danger every day for doing our jobs…This fact has to wake us up.""

In the last five years threats made toward federal judges have increased 400%. Last year the threats totaled more than 4200.

The FBI investigation into Daniel's murder revealed the 72-year-old shooter Roy Den Hollander had been stalking the Salas family. He had notes about routes the judge took to work the school her son attended and where the family went to church.

The FBI also told Judge Salas that the wounds sustained by Daniel appear to indicate he was trying to block Hollander from getting to her.

Police found Hollander's body the day after he killed Daniel Salas. He committed suicide.

The information obtained by Hollander was accessed legally on the internet. Judge Salas is now advocating for new legislation to provide additional protection for federal judges.

The proposed legislation calls for more than $250 million worth of home security upgrades and the hiring of 1000 deputy marshals. It also calls for the online removal of personal data including home addresses driver's license information and property tax records.

The legislation is expected to be taken-up by the Senate.

The former Chelino’s Mexican Restaurant building in Bricktown — a victim of the coronavirus and related business shutdowns and slowdowns — is in new hands.

Shervin Dardashti paid Richard Bricktown LLC $1188000 for the 12725-square-foot building at 15 E California in a transaction by broker Allison Barta Bailey with Price Edwards & Co. County records also show Rose Hill Builders LLC as a new part owner of the two-story property which dates to 1906.

The new owners’ exact plans for the building could not immediately be determined. Neither Dardashti nor anyone with Rose Hill Builders could be reached on Friday.

“This unique property has four patio spaces that we expect to be back in use following a renovation from the new owner” Price Edwards said. The firm had no information on timing.

The coronavirus hit Bricktown hard causing the closing of several restaurants although eateries are in the works.

Some will come back as part of “a lopsided rebound in the retail market” said David Hartnack vice president of retail for NAI Sullivan Group another commercial property brokerage.

“Many traditional dine-in restaurants and traditional box-style retail stores have depleted their cash reserves and are faced with possible long-term sales reductions with customers who have migrated even further towards online shopping and food delivery services” Hartnack said Friday in a quarterly report. “The winners of the pandemic market like drive-thru restaurants and grocery stores saw record-breaking sales without a need for a major reinvestment. We expect this to fuel a surge of new growth in these market segments.”

In a Facebook post Keshia Smith asked: “When is the government going to address applying a tax on a tax? There is no reason we should be paying VAT on customs. I’m sick of it suck my teeth.”

The comment received 200 reactions and nearly 100 comments as of 4pm Friday.

The post attracted the attention of the acting financial secretary who acknowledged that the question has been posed by the public “from time to time”.

“The simplest answer is that value-added tax is applied at the final landed value of a good inclusive of shipping fees and all other applicable taxes” he responded in the comments of the original post.

“This is how it is treated around the world in jurisdictions which have a VAT tax.”

He attached FedEx’s website and underscored that the company explains to its customers across the globe how to calculate the tax that a country may apply on a good shipped via FedEx.

His response received a flurry of comments the majority of which bemoaned the practice while others said the government promised to reduce duty to offset the existing taxation of imported goods.

Some accused the government official of sidestepping the question and suggested the government was unfairly double-taxing its citizens.

Others called on the government to reign in on spending instead of continuing to tax its way out of the red at the expense of Bahamians’ quality of life.

But Johnson said while the tax system and level of government spending in the economy could be discussed and debated “this post is about whether it is ‘right’ for the government to charge VAT on other taxes”.

“I am pointing out that the nature of a VAT tax is that it is applied on top of all other taxes fees etc. that contribute to the landed value of a product.”

Facebook user “Annie Boo” said how the tax is calculated does not make its application right or fair.

“I collected my packages…and over 70 percent of the bill was customs and VAT” she wrote.

“So I paid a tax to purchase it and a tax to bring it in.

“It’s robbery no matter where it’s done in the world.

“The explanation really doesn’t justify it; 45 percent [duty] plus VAT really?

“If the government cares about its people it wouldn’t be taxing them so heavily to generate revenue.

“Find other industries to grow and make money from and get off its citizens’ backs.”

To this Johnson said the nature of the tax makes its application correct.

He used an example of purchasing an item from a store in Miami that was imported from China.

He said the import duty for importing the item is factored into the price.

“And you pay the sale tax on the price that includes their customs duties as well” he said.

“This is how these taxes work.”

Gavin Knowles another Facebook user noted the government promised to reduce customs duties and claimed it had not.

The government has introduced a wide range of reductions in customs duties since 2017.

As he delivered the 2020/2021 budget communication then Finance Minister Peter Turnquest announced the government will provide a back-to-school VAT holiday; a reduction of duty of fishing material — from 45 percent to 20 percent; farming equipment from 25 percent to 10 percent; and a wide range of building materials to 20 percent.

Duty was also reduced on items to encourage green technologies and plastic elimination.

These include a 35 percent reduction of duty on environmental sea trash cans and reusable metal water bottles and a 65 percent reduction on motorcycles with an engine size of 125 cc or less and electric motorcycles.

The reductions in key areas were intended to incentivize economic activity and ease the burden on Bahamians — nearly two years after the Minnis administration increased VAT from 7.5 percent to 12 percent in July 2018 an increase of 60 percent."

(WAVE) - A dramatic increase in gun sales and a rise in suicide nationwide has one Kentucky non-profit getting the word out on gun safety.

Firearms sales saw a large increase in 2020. The Firearm Industry Trade Association reported a 95 percent increase in gun sales that is a reported five million new first time gun buyers in the US.

For some like Whitney Austin this increase is a major concern.

Austin survived a mass shooting in Cincinnati back in September 2018.

“I was shot 12 times. I thought that I was walking into work just like any other day and I walked into a mass shooting” Whitney Austin Executive Director of The Whitney Strong Organization said.

That shooting happened at the Fifth Third Bank Headquarters. Three people were killed by the shooter 29-year-old Omar Perez who was shot by police officers.

It was that moment in her life that birthed her non-profit Whitney Strong. The organization advocates for gun safety.

“And gun locks are a very good solution for providing gun violence” Austin said.

Members of St. Stephen Church attended a virtual gun safety class and afterwards were given free gun locks.

The group pushes for these locks saying they can help prevent suicide accidents and gun violence.

“Gun locks can make a difference that is one simple thing that you can do” Austin said.

In fact Isaksen is performing five times as many solar installations now than they did their first year in business.

While discussing his reasons for starting Isaksen Solar customer service stood out the most. “I saw how bad larger company’s customer service was and as they got bigger it got worse” Ryan stated. “I realized I could provide a superior product if I stayed local and small. When I quit I realized I wasn’t good at operation so I reached out to Brad because he was good at sales. We met at a coffee shop in Rhode Island and within 30 minutes he said ‘I’m in’ and the rest is history.”

A success story during challenging times

In the first half of 2020 the world got walloped by the coronavirus and caused significant death and economic devastation. Families lost loved ones and Americans saw the greatest loss of jobs since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Fortunately America and the world have turned the corner thanks to several COVID-19 immunizations.

Due to hard work an amazing workforce and leadership Isaksen Solar not only got through the pandemic but saw a booming solar installation business – growing revenue by 50% in 2020. This growth has not only ensured security for their current workforce but they continue putting people to work with great paying jobs. Isaksen Solar has grown from three full-time employees in 2017 to 17 full-time employees in 2021.

The U.S. solar market saw $10 billion in revenue in 2019 and is expected to more than double to $22.9 billion by 2025. Unlike most industries the solar industry makes a significant positive impact on climate change and helps people save money on their electric bills – if not completely eliminate the cost. Even in a booming industry a lot can go wrong and Isaksen Solar has exceeded expectations due to Ryan’s obsession with customer service and high-quality products.

“From day one I’ve always believed in using American-made high-quality panels” Ryan stated. “Everyone else is trying to get the cheapest Chinese products.”

In fact Isaksen’s panels have a 25-year warranty which means that if anything goes wrong with them Ryan’s team takes care of it.

Isaksen Solar’s growth is partially due to tax breaks from federal and state governments and incentives electric companies provide to install solar. In essence customers that install solar panels on their homes can not only get rid of their electric bills but have the electric companies pay them for excess solar energy generated. Ryan and his team walk you through the process every step of the way – filing all the paperwork with the government and electric company.

Isaksen Solars reviews speak for themselves

Isaksen Solar has 152 Google reviews all 152 are 5 stars. That’s not only unheard of in the solar industry I challenge you to find a perfect rating on Google with any company that has over 150 reviews. Also Isaksen Solar has been voted #1 in South Coast Today’s “Best of the Best” for the past three years – another rare achievement that speaks volumes to their happy customer base.

It is safe to assume that CEOs do glance at their share price from time to time. Lando too. And if he did it at any time over the past year he’d have reason to be pleased. Over the past 12 months while the world was battling Covid-19 SolarEdge stock prices multiplied more than threefold climbing from $100 per share last January to $330 this week.

“When we first hit a billion dollars in annual sales it was definitely a feeling of accomplishment” says Lando. “When you reach such a sum you start thinking about how to push on and reach $2 billion in sales. Today we’re already at around $1.5 billion.”

“That is not on the table at all. Our desire intent and activity is focused on expanding the company into even more avenues in the field of green and renewable energy. SolarEdge is a horse you can ride into the sunset and that’s precisely what we aim to do.”

Guy Still Appears in my Dreams Telling me What to Do

The current produced by photovoltaic cells is a direct current. You need an inverter to turn it into the alternating current that matches the electricity grid. That was the first thing that SolarEdge developed. The company was founded in 2006 by five partners and it took them three years to develop their first product. When it was ready it was no longer just an inverter but a tool that enabled remote monitoring and optimization of individual solar panels (according to the direction of the sunlight shade and other variables). It was at that stage that Lando joined the company as VP of global sales and within several months SolarEdge landed its first client in Germany.

Since then the company has grown significantly and for the past two years has cornered the market in the inverter sector (according to international research institute IHS). The company’s list of clients and markets is consistently growing as are investments in it. In 2015 it went public in New York and over the past two years through a series of acquisitions has also entered the electricity storage electrical propulsion and uninterruptible power supply markets. It employs 3400 people in its global production and development centers 1800 of them in Israel. It opened its new 14000 square-meter electronics plant in northern Israel just six months ago.

It is impossible however to talk about SolarEdge and its success without mentioning Guy Sella the founder the driving spirit and the CEO of the company until August 2019 when he passed away from cancer of the bowels.

“Guy was a mythical figure” Lando says. “To this day when we do something that he would have opposed we glance at his photo that hangs in the office and say ‘cover his ears for a moment’.”

SolarEdge was largely built in Sella’s image who would have turned 57 next week. He served in the IDF’s elite combat intelligence unit Sayeret Matkal and was injured in the line of duty. He later went on to study industrial management at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology returned to the military where he served in the Intelligence Corp’s technological unit advanced in the ranks was awarded the coveted Israel Defense Prize and after his discharge joined the venture capital industry until he founded SolarEdge together with some of his former army subordinates.

He was also the person who led to the establishment of the new manufacturing facility which was inaugurated on the one year anniversary of his death and named in his honor “Sella 1.” The first thing you see as you enter the factory is a commemoration wall in his honor featuring the words of a song that he wrote and an electronic display that features photos of him and texts that he penned. The new battery plant that SolarEdge is building in South Korea will be named “Sella 2” and “there will be many more Sellas in the future” a senior executive at the company says.

Sella is often remembered for being determined and aggressive a creative figure colorful and tumultuous. One of his signature features was his affection for flip-flops which he would often wear even at formal occasions. “I had big flip-flops to fill” quips Lando with a smile.

“Guy was creative but mostly he was determined. Sometimes we would take a long time deliberating a move but once we had decided on a course we would do it with full force marching to victory clinging to the mission with complete determination and everybody knew where it came from. Even now we often joke amongst ourselves about who Guy visited in a dream and what instructions he gave us.

“But Guy was primarily my friend. We are roughly the same age and so are our children our families spent a lot of time together. Shortly after I joined SolarEdge I was with my daughter at a tennis competition and happened to run into Guy who was there with his daughter. The girls became friends and we’d occasionally travel together for a few days to tennis competitions.

“I spent more accumulated hours with Guy than I did with my wife. We were both a bit older than the others and we discovered a shared curiosity a great appreciation for professionalism which manifested in our interest in sports and biographies — he was a big fan of Winston Churchill and John McCain. We had a tradition during business trips to go out for ice cream at 2 a.m. We’d text one another ‘ice-cream?’and head out.”

You weren’t exactly identical.

“We both had the same haircut” Lando says with a smile indicating his bald head” but we came from different backgrounds and have pretty different characters “I come from a more conservative background not a big adventurer. Guy was more adventurous dynamic creative. Let’s be honest Guy had a much richer and more accomplished past. He was also much more sociable than I am. But still in terms of our curiosity appreciation of professionalism basic perceptions and values when it comes to family and business we were pretty similar.”

He stayed on as CEO and chairman of the company until three days before his death. Did you have a chance to say goodbye to him?

“The two years during which he was sick was a complicated time in many ways. Ten days before the last board meeting he chaired I traveled to the U.S. When I landed in New York I had a message from Guy asking that I get back to him. He told me ‘according to a test I did yesterday — it’s over a matter of weeks. We have to start preparing’.”

What do you say in a moment like that?

“I told him: ‘Guy I love you’ and he answered ‘coming from you I know it is the truth’.”

Did you try to encourage him sow seeds of hope?

“He was a realist a scientist. He knew exactly what was going on what was left in his arsenal he was not one to draw encouragement in his assessment of his condition.

“In the following two weeks he made arrangements for everything on all fronts — both in his personal life and in the company. He spoke about what needed to be done in the future including relaying that ‘it all depends on you’ and he announced that I would be taking on the role of CEO. With an emphasis on ‘announced’ he wasn’t one to ask questions. He asserted.”

How did you start off at the company? When did you first meet him?

“I was at Applied Materials for 16 years running the company’s Israeli division’s business activities. Applied Materials’ core activity is machines that produce semiconductors but at one stage it entered the solar energy field. After it acquired a company in Italy I was assigned to manage it and that was how I was first exposed to the solar energy world in 2008. At the same time SolarEdge had a working product and it was time to figure out how to bring it to market. All of the founders — Yoav Galin Meir Adest Amir Fishelov Lior Handelsman and Guy himself — came from a military background in product development but none had any business experience and I had gotten tired of travelling back and forth to Italy. This all led to a meeting with Guy over a plate of Humus.

In flip-flops.

“Naturally what a question. Afterwards I met with the other founders and in mid 2009 I joined the company to lead SolarEdge’s business activity.”

And then 10 years later you find yourself taking over as CEO. How did you feel about it?

“Some people at the company compared it to Tim Cook and Steve Jobs. Comparing Guy to Jobs may be apt but comparing me to Cook is an exaggeration.”

Lando is carrying on Sella’s path but is also doing some things differently. For example “Guy was amazing at mechanics. Among his list of many attributes he was a gifted mechanic and planner. We have excellent mechanics on the team but it was customary for Guy to make the decisions when it comes to mechanics. To this day when the mechanical team presents a new product and they are unsure on which screw to use things go silent and everyone looks at me. And I tell them ‘guys the days in which the CEO determines which screw to use are over’.”

Did you ever think you would replace him?

“I never coveted his position in any way. I was just planning to be part of a team that builds a substantial Israeli company.”

When Elon Musk Messes With Your Stock Price

The renewable energy market has been scorching in recent years alongside the increase in awareness about the gravity of the climate crisis and its catastrophic repercussions. The advance of technological developments that increased efficiency and lowered the cost of solar panels and energy storage facilities have also accelerated activities in the field. The election of Joe Biden to the presidency and the incentives he promised to expedite the shift to renewable energy have contributed to the revolution too. But the industry is still subject to turbulence sometimes coming from unexpected forces. One of those forces who in recent weeks has also shaken up Wall Street is Elon Musk. A month ago the founder of Tesla announced that his electric car company would replace the inverters that it currently purchases from SolarEdge with its own causing the Israeli company’s stock price to dive by nearly 16% in one day.

How does it feel to lose $3 billion in enterprise value in a single day?

“Tesla has been our client for more than a decade and as a result of this decision it will gradually reduce its purchases from us. For our part we will attempt to show it that our products are good and that it is in Tesla’s interest to continue purchasing them. Tesla remains a respectable client but these days it is less substantial in terms of revenues.”

The investors seemed to be spooked by the announcement.

“That’s because the name Tesla carries a lot of weight and it is indeed a significant event but the impact is not that huge. It is only one of 50 concerns that keep me up at night.”

Your stock is currently trading for more than $300 a share. Those kinds of figures strengthen the claim that renewable energy companies’ valuations on Wall Street are bloated and that it’s all a giant bubble.

“We were told similar things when our stock was worth $200 and $250 too. We don’t think in terms of raising the stock value only of raising the company’s value which means more sales more profits and more growth.

“A decade ago when we were looking for companies with a large solar market to operate in there were only 10 now there are 15 or 20. The basic market trends show an increase in solar energy and electric vehicles. These trends are rapidly advancing and irreversible. Quite a few countries are dedicating resources to these fields as part of their post-pandemic exit mechanisms. Sure administrations have an impact but the basic trends are driven by life itself.”

Lando (56) was born to a religious family but now lives a secular lifestyle. He attended a religious high school and was active in a religious youth movement which is how he met his wife who is a psychologist. He was injured in a jeep accident while serving in the Israeli military and later served as an intelligence officer. He adopted his Israeli nationality when he was five years old after his family immigrated from New Jersey and to this day it is an integral part of the company’s business activity which he insists will not seep out of Israel.

SolarEdge is only traded in the U.S. most of your production is carried out overseas what is it that makes the company Israeli?

“All of our corporate management sits here in Israel nearly all of our development takes place here and we currently also have a production line here. But from the start we had the far greater international market in our sights. I’m glad that the Israeli market has woken up to solar energy and it is nice to be playing in our ‘home court’ competing for projects here however our local activity makes up only a fraction of our total activity. We are a green technology company that was born in Israel but has a global orientation.”

Teva Pharmaceuticals also started out that way but is currently very un-Israeli.

“We have no plans of going down that path. We haven’t relocated any Israeli employees. Our U.S. manager is an American the manager in Germany is German the manager in Australia is an Australian and the manager in India is an Indian. Though nowadays they seem more Israeli than I do. They often use the Hebrew words of encouragement ‘Yalla’ and ‘Kadima’ So much so that our U.S. manager calls me up and says ‘Zivi I want to make a Kombina’ (Hebrew for deal). They’ve gone through a process of Israelification. Moreover all the Israeli founders are still involved in the company in a sort of harmony that is rare for a successful 15-year-old company. Guy would always say ‘prediction is always a complicated thing especially when it comes to the future’ in that vein I can assert that our intention is to remain Israeli but I am not in the business of making promises and guarantees.”

What is the financial reasoning behind the decision after 15 years to open a $50 million production facility in Israel at a time that nearly all companies prefer to shift to cheaper production in the east?

“Expanding production in Israel is indeed a slightly unusual decision but beyond the patriotic motivation it is important for the development of new products. We opened the Israeli plant to take advantage of the proximity to the development team. We want to design the manufacturing processes here create the prototypes for new products which can then be easily duplicated by our subcontractors around the world. On the surface it seems like any other large electronics plant but what’s unique about it is its level of automation. That is the way to cope with the high labor costs here which are 10 times higher than what it costs us in Vietnam. Automation also upholds the quality of the product which is meant to last for 25 years otherwise repair costs are huge.”

Growing courtesy of the Koreans Italians and Biden

Over the past two years SolarEdge has carried out three acquisitions that underline its intentions to expand into new fields. In 2018 it acquired Jerusalem-based Gamatronic a 40-year old uninterrupted power supply systems (UPS) manufacturer for $41 million. Later the same year it acquired Korean-based Lithium-ion battery manufacturer Kokam for $88 million and in January 2019 it acquired Italian integrated powertrain technology company SMRE for $77 million.

These acquisitions indicate expansion into new fields. Is that because you’ve exhausted the core market?

“We are the global leaders in inverters for private homes and one of the leaders in commercial rooftop installations but at the moment we are not a major player in the market of large ground-based solar fields so we still have a lot of room to grow in our core market. But the acquisitions also granted us entrance into the electric powertrain and energy storage sectors both of which are fields where we identify significant growth potential. All of these systems have to do with energy conversion whether it’s of electric vehicles solar batteries or UPS networks. They all relate to the technological capabilities that we’ve been developing for the past 15 years.”

So what does your vision actually entail?

“Imagine a neighborhood in which many of the houses operate as power plants. It’s easiest to imagine it in the residential sector because the seeds of it already exist. Our individual homes will function as ‘prosumers’ (both producers and consumers). They will produce their own power their devices will be planned in a way that fully maximizes the energy of the sun and their inner systems will be smart and based on economic considerations meaning they will be able to sell surplus energy they produce to others. It’s a vision that can already be imagined.

“In all the futuristic movies we see these white devices that speak to their owners. We once made an internal company video on that theme in which Amazon’s Alexa wakes you up in the morning saying ‘the water is at the precise temperature you requested and we saved a thousand trees from being chopped down — go take a shower.’ That might be on the extreme end of the vision but it will be difficult to stop.”

How do electric vehicles fit in with the vision?

“Electric vehicles will require charging and in certain conditions it can also provide power to the house. Maybe you’ll charge your car at work and it will function as a backup battery for your home. It will store energy after all and that energy can be converted.”

You can use the energy in vehicles to power homes?

“Absolutely. The battery that we manufactured and which is charged by solar energy is the same one they install in electric vehicles. You can both charge and discharge it. We will provide the inverter and the battery. The inverter is at the core of our technology.”

Will the Administration change in the White House aid in things developing in that direction?

“There is a government initiative up for debate on reducing taxes on the use of renewable energy in battery storage. It hasn’t been approved yet but it may expand the market. Nowadays 10% of private homes have a battery. If that grows to 30% or 40% it would be huge for us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL3JpY2gtZXNjYXBlLXVucmVsaWFibGUtcG93ZXItZ3JpZC1taWNyb2dyaWRzLzExNTQ5MTkyOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the rich can escape America's unreliable power grid,"Dana Hull

When Wim Coekaerts bought a hillside lot to build his California dream house there was an old horse barn a grove of olive trees and lovely views of Silicon Valley. But there was no electricity and the nearest utility pole to his bucolic acre was 550 feet away.

The town of Woodside requires new homes without utility service to pay for wires to be buried underground. Coekaerts faced a choice: pay PG&E Corp. roughly $100000 for engineering work and foot the enormous additional cost of the trenching or engineer a more personal fix.

Coekaerts who grew up in Belgium is a man who highly values reliable stable electricity - something PG&E has not always provided in recent years amid increasingly ferocious wildfires. And it's not just California: this week a winter storm has paralyzed the grid in much of Texas highlighting just how fragile the legacy system is. Coekaerts is senior vice president of software development at Oracle Corp. a legend in the open source community and is the longest serving board member of the Linux Foundation. We all want the lights to stay on; he needs to be able to run his servers and charge his electric Tesla Model S.

His house is the exact opposite of a small cabin: It was designed by an architect and spans 2800 square feet. Coekaerts started puzzling through the engineering challenges: What if he cut ties with PG&E? What would it take to build his own self-sufficient energy system with the electricity produced and stored on site? He started researching microgrids a small energy grid with control capability which typically means it can disconnect from the traditional grid. Coekaerts wanted to be autonomous from the beginning. He started looking at Tesla's energy products: the home battery known as the Powerwall and larger systems called Powerpacks.

""This is not a tiny home"" says Coekaerts as contractors put the finishing touches on the three-bedroom limestone house. ""A lot of people say they are off grid but they have a tiny house where they only need two solar panels. I didn't want to have a lifestyle where I'm just getting by. This is a normal house with normal energy consumption and I can charge my car if needed.""

In the developing world microgrids may leap frog traditional utilities much in the way that mobile phones made the need for landlines obsolete. In the U.S. military bases universities prisons and hospitals are turning to microgrids as a way to operate independently from the grid. The Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County about a half-hour's drive east of Oakland has a microgrid that allows it to operate as an island for extended periods.

Individuals are also pursuing them. Larry Ellison who serves on the board of directors of Tesla Inc. and is the chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle has expressed interest in a microgrid for Lanai the island in Hawaii that he bought in 2012. Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing that director James Murdoch purchased a Powerpack system from the company for $600000 in 2019 and that in 2020 a company affiliated with Ellison ""entered into an agreement to obtain preliminary design services from us for an estimated $400000 relating to the potential future implementation of a Tesla Energy system.""

PG&E has more than half a million residential solar customers and at least 18000 have installed battery energy storage systems. You hear a lot in California about ""solar plus storage"": solar panels to harvest sunlight into electricity paired with a home battery that can store the electricity for later use like after the sun goes down. Tesla markets the Powerwall as a backup for when the grid goes down. The Powerpack is mostly sold to businesses and utilities.

Coekaerts didn't want his system to function as a backup to the grid: He wanted to be independent of the grid. So through Luminalt the San Francisco company that installed his solar system he was able to get a Powerpack which is about 17 times what a single Powerwall provides. Tesla representatives have told him it is the first residential Powerpack installation that they know of though others are in the pipeline. The total cost including permitting labor for the installation and a federal tax credit for the solar system was roughly $300000.

His system which was activated in November combines 27 kw of photovoltaic solar panels with a 232kWh Tesla Powerpack. There are five ground-mounted arrays of 15 solar panels each or 75 solar panels total stretching across the yard. The Tesla Powerpack which on the outside just looks like a massive white box with Tesla's logo emits a low hum and is protected and surrounded by a tasteful wooden fence. During long summer days the system will probably generate far more electricity than he needs and neighbors have joked that they'll get out their extension cords.

PG&E has become something of a villain to many Californians in recent years. The state has staggered through increasingly devastating wildfire seasons and some of the blazes were sparked by aging utility infrastructure. Faulty PG&E equipment ignited the November 2018 Camp Fire an inferno that destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. In March PG&E's residential customers will see their rates increase as the utility which recently emerged from bankruptcy seeks to upgrade its equipment. When there's high wind and fire danger PG&E - which provides natural gas and electric service to roughly 15 million people from the Oregon border to Bakersfield - proactively shuts off power to tens of thousands of customers. Costs keep rising and outages are becoming more routine.

But it's not just PG&E: Last week the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which manages the flow of electric power to more than 26 million Texas customers was crippled by a snow storm that froze wind turbines kicked natural gas plants offline and resulted in widespread outages that left millions of people shivering in their homes. The climate crisis is here to stay and finding ways to function independently of utilities is gaining traction.

""On the one hand it's an engineering marvel to produce all of the needs of a modern house with locally produced power"" says Rich Brown a research scientist in the building technologies and urban systems division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. ""On the other hand it's still expensive.""

The future says Brown is aggregation: It is far more cost effective to build a microgrid if you're serving multiple people like an entire city block or a new subdivision. Brown and colleagues at the Berkeley Lab are working on a project called ""Ecoblock"" in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland that will serve about 25 housing units.

""Low income neighborhoods tend to have more pollution and the capital required to go solar or buy a battery is just too high"" says Brown. ""There's an equity issue. Ecoblock could be a model for how you could collectively take a neighborhood and make it more resilient and do it cost effectively.""

Coekaerts agrees. ""When it comes to apartment buildings and new homes instead of using the normal power grid they should do something like this"" says Coekaerts. ""It seems like a real scalable solution.""

Coekaerts knows that he is a rare early adopter. Besides being inherently tech-savvy he has the willingness - and the ample financial resources - to prove the concept. He's kept a detailed history of how his microgrid has performed over the last few months in hopes of sharing the information maybe via a YouTube video to educate others on the process. His main message is that it works: He has zero concern about running out of power.

""The climate is changing and you see that every year it gets worse"" says Coekaerts. ""I'm not a prepper but I want to be self-reliant. And there's a cool factor to this. If I can do this other people can do it too. It's nice to be on the forefront of something that is coming.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2Nvb2wtdGVjaC9hbnRpLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLW5pZ2h0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24v0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29vbC10ZWNoL2FudGktc29sYXItcG93ZXItbmlnaHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harnessing darkness: The race to solve solar power’s greatest problem,"Renewable energy from waste: AuREUS wins first ever Sustainability Award | James Dyson Award 2020

The solar industry is growing at a breakneck pace and thanks to that growth renewable energy is now eclipsing coal as an energy source. But solar energy does have infamous flaws: It doesn’t generate electricity at night and it doesn’t generate it very well when it’s cloudy. Solar power as you surely realize needs the sun.

But what if it didn’t? What if there was a solution to solar power’s sun problem? Well as it turns out there are researchers all over the globe racing to find one and there are a number of proposed solutions that could make it happen. Here’s a quick tour of the tech and techniques scientists are exploring.

The ‘antisolar panel’

If you want to generate electricity from an extraterrestrial energy source (aka the sun) like you do with solar panels but generate that power during the night one option is what some have dubbed the “antisolar panel.” This option relies on generating energy from the cold of space rather than the warm light of the sun.

It sounds a bit strange but it’s scientifically sound. The idea is that you point the panel at space during the evening and it will be warm relative to the cold of space which will cause it to radiate heat as invisible infrared light. You can then capture that infrared light to generate electricity.

Aaswath Raman an assistant professor of materials science and engineering tells Digital Trends that this would help you generate electricity at night but it won’t generate nearly as much electricity as a solar panel does from the sun.

“The sun as an energy resource is vastly more powerful than what you can get out of this cooling effect at night that we take advantage of — radiant cooling” Raman says. “From an electricity generation point of view it’s always at best I think going to be additive.”

Raman says if you’ve already invested in installing solar panels this can help get you more bang for your buck by improving “the economics of the underlying system.”

Capturing more wavelengths

Solar panels capture a large portion of solar radiation but they don’t capture everything. They’re great for generating electricity from direct sunlight but they’re not so great at generating electricity on a cloudy day. One solution to this problem that’s been proposed is capturing invisible ultraviolet light which is present even when it’s cloudy and then converting it into visible light to generate electricity as a solar panel normally would.

“There’s stuff that’s coming at long wavelengths from the sun that a solar panel usually doesn’t convert” Raman says. “It just goes into heat and people have proposed and … shown ways that you can convert some of that light into light that a solar panel could make into electricity.”

Building bigger batteries

When all else fails there’s also a well-established workaround to the fact that solar panels don’t produce power at night: Store excess energy while the sun is out in batteries. You may have seen the microgrids Tesla has built around the world for example.

Raman says batteries will be a crucial part of solving solar power’s biggest problem but we’re not currently at a place where batteries can store enough electricity to run a city for example. He says we still need to develop new battery technology to store such a massive amount of energy.

“There are options today that are doable and usable for relatively small scales. It’s really a question of how big can you go” Raman says. “The scales get pretty daunting when you are thinking about how much battery power you need.”

Researchers are looking into everything from flow batteries to compressed air to store energy. Raman says the solution to solar power’s problems doesn’t have to be just batteries or some other idea either. He says we can utilize multiple different technologies to solve this problem.

“You will see a huge amount of battery deployment for sure. Will that be everything? I suspect not” Raman says. “I suspect there will be other ideas.”

Leading the exhibition a pair of the most significant but nearly never-seen vehicles from the museum’s collection:

1901 Ford Sweepstakes. Driven by Henry Ford on Oct. 10 1901 at a Grosse Pointe horse track this car’s victory helped secure funding for Ford Motor Co.

1908 Locomobile Old 16. The wonderfully named Locomobile won the 1908 Vanderbilt Cup the first win in a major international race by an American car.

The exhibition is called ""Driven to Win: Racing in America.""

“We realized our collection of racing materials was underserved” Henry Ford Curator of Transportation Matt Anderson said. In addition to 26 vehicles from many types of racing the exhibition includes an interactive film information on the lives of famous racing figures and VR simulators to show what it’s like driving on some of the world’s most famous tracks.

Sponsored by General Motors the exhibition includes vehicles from many brands including the 1988 Indy 500-winning Chevy-Penske a 1956 Chrysler 300-B of the type that dominated NASCAR for years and the 1967 Ford Mark IV — commonly called the GT— that Americans Dan Gurney and AJ Foyt drove to win Le Mans.

The 2016 Ford GT that also won Le Mans is also on display along with a clay model from its development and a specially built car that shows how similar the racing and production versions were.

Disasters records and triumphs

Planning for the exhibition began in 2007. The museum part of the Henry Ford complex that also includes the historic buildings of Greenfield Village acquired more recent vehicles to complement those from the auto industry’s earliest days.

“It takes a lot to win but very little to lose” a race Anderson said citing the 1935 Miller-Ford. Powered by a modified Ford production V8 engine the car competed in the ’35 Indy 500 but failed to finish because the exhaust manifold located too close to the steering box boiled lubricants causing the steering to lock.

Ford’s first foray into Indy racing the debacle drove the company away from racing till the 1960s.

Featured vehicles from other types of racing:

1951 Beatty Belly Tank Lakester. Built for land-speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats it was fastest in its class in 1951 1952 1955 1959 and 1962.

1965 Goldenrod. Another land-speed car its record of 409.277 mph stood until 1991.

1958 Moore/Unser Pikes Peak Hill Climb Car. Driven by Bobby Unser in six of his 10 Pikes Peak wins including five straight (1959-63) and 1966.

1972 McLaren M16-Offenhauser. Crash remnants of one of the most chilling incidents in Indy 500 history.

2011 Wood Brothers Ford Fusion driven to victory by Trevor Bayne in 2011.

1933 Willys drag racer.

Other highlights include 70 Spindizzies 18-inch-long model cars that could top 150 mph running in a circle while tethered to a pole from the 1930s to 1950s.

“Spindizzies were a craze — like the Hula Hoop” Anderson said. “They weren’t toys. It was an adult hobby. A Spindizzy could cost $120 in the 1930s when a brand new Ford cost $500.”

The massive exhibition covers about a third of the museum’s 24000 square feet of automotive display space.

A purpose-built theater screens a 15-minute film that follows five young people racing. The theater features a screen shaped like a helmet visor racing-style seats that rumble with the engine and puffs of air at the start. The film is covered by the admission price for the museum but there’s an extra charge for the racing simulators.

The Henry Ford is open 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m. seven days a week. Due to the pandemic masks are required and capacity is limited to 1500 people a day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi9saW5jb2xuLW5hdXRpbHVzLXNhbGVzLW51bWJlcnMtZmlndXJlcy1yZXN1bHRzLWZvdXJ0aC1xdWFydGVyLTIwMjAtcTQv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3JkYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyL2xpbmNvbG4tbmF1dGlsdXMtc2FsZXMtbnVtYmVycy1maWd1cmVzLXJlc3VsdHMtZm91cnRoLXF1YXJ0ZXItMjAyMC1xNC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lincoln Nautilus Sales Drop Faster Than Segment Average During Q4 2020,"Lincoln Nautilus sales fell in the United States Mexico and South Korea during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Lincoln replaced the MKX with the Nautilus in 2019 in conjunction with the crossover’s midcycle refresh.

The luxury D-crossover segment expanded 6 percent to 155310 units during Q4 2020 meaning Lincoln Nautilus sales significantly underperformed the segment average during the quarter. In fact Nautilus sales fell the most (on a percentage basis) during the week.

We should note that Lexus RX sales now include the two-row RX and the three-row RX L with the three-row RX L being a rival to the new Lincoln Aviator. As such a more apt comparison would be to pit Nautilus and Aviator sales against those of the RX.

Adding Nautilus and Aviator sales nets Lincoln 13970 combined deliveries in Q4 20838 units less than the Lexus RX.

The Ford Authority Take

The substantial drop in Lincoln Nautilus sales during Q4 2020 is concerning especially when considering that the midsize luxury crossover posted the biggest drop in sales in its segment on a percentage basis.

Potential factors that may have contributed to the lackluster performance include:

Sub-par Nautilus inventory at the retail (dealer level). More desirable product offerings from competitors including substantially newer offerings from Infiniti and BMW. Better purchase or lease incentives offered by competitors including higher residual values for lease customers.

Luckily the 2021 Lincoln Nautilus will deliver several updates in key areas including an overhauled cockpit (interior) with new infotainment. Here’s to hoping that this will be enough to spur interest and purchase consideration of the Nautilus.

Brace yourself for an emissions-free future.

No more internal combustion engines. No more polluting trucks and cars. Only 100% electric vehicles will be shown and sold in dealerships.

Automakers are shaking up and electrifying their lineups teasing motorists with images of upcoming gasless vehicles. The U.S. automotive industry will look a lot different by 2025 than it does today.

Online car shopping site Edmunds predicts 2021 will be a ""pivotal year"" for electric vehicles with U.S. sales rising to 2.5% versus 1.9% last year. Consumers will also see a deluge of new models entering the market in the next 11 months: 30 EVs from 21 brands up from 17 models in 2020 according to Edmunds.

Stephanie Brinley an industry expert at IHS Markit said a larger selection of EVs at affordable prices will help change Americans' attitudes on emissions-free vehicles. Automakers though will have to work hard to highlight why EVs are the smarter choice she added.

""Cost is still a factor and range anxiety will be partly addressed by education"" Brinley told ABC News. ""There's no reason a consumer can't adjust to an electric vehicle.""

Which automakers are charging up their portfolios and betting big on battery technology?

Jaguar Land Rover

The British company owned by India's Tata Motors has become the latest manufacturer to commit to an electric future.

Jaguar the storied sports car maker known for its seductive designs will become an ""all-electric luxury brand"" by 2025 to ""realize its unique potential"" the marque announced Feb. 15. Future Jaguar models will be built ""exclusively on a pure electric architecture"" the company noted.

The latest Jaguar F-TYPE sports car was redesigned for 2021. Jaguar Land Rover

Jaguar currently manufacturers one EV: The I-PACE. Global sales of the stylish futuristic-looking SUV totaled 7807 units in 2020.

The first all-electric Land Rover model will come in 2024 followed by five ""pure electric variants"" in the next five years the company said. Moreover JLR expects nearly 60% of Land Rovers sold by 2030 will be equipped with zero tailpipe powertrains.

The company has set another ambitious goal: Zero net carbon emissions in its supply chain products and operations by 2039.

Ford Motor

The Dearborn automaker's new splashy Mustang Mach-E SUV has Tesla owners trading in their vehicles for this all-electric Ford. The company's next vehicle launch with a battery-electric drivetrain will likely be the F-150 pickup truck in early 2022.

Ford's rollout of battery-powered vehicles in the U.S. has been slow compared to the competition. In Europe however Ford's entire passenger vehicle lineup will run solely on batteries by 2030.

Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition Ford Motor

This week Ford pledged to spend $1 billion to overhaul its factory in Cologne Germany as a base for electric vehicle production. Two-thirds of Ford’s commercial vehicle sales expected to be all-electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030 and Ford's newly announced partnership with Volkswagen will help the company achieve its EV targets.

""Our announcement today to transform our Cologne facility the home of our operations in Germany for 90 years is one of the most significant Ford has made in over a generation. It underlines our commitment to Europe and a modern future with electric vehicles at the heart of our strategy for growth"" Ford of Europe President Stuart Rowley said in a statement.

The 117-year-old automaker recently doubled its investment in electric vehicles to $22 billion by the end of 2025.

Elected officials in Europe have been aggressively regulating tailpipe emissions. To avoid costly penalties and fines automakers are phasing out petroleum-powered cars and trucks for EVs.

Bentley Motors

The formidable mighty W12 and V8 engines that power Bentley's pricey sedans grand tourers and SUVs will soon become part of automotive legend.

2021 Bentley Flying Spur V8 Bentley Motors

The ultra luxury automaker announced in November that its first electric vehicle will debut in 2025. Then by 2030 every conveyance assembled at its Crewe U.K. factory will be battery electric.

Adrian Hallmark Bentley's CEO acknowledged the company's bold move calling it a ""profound change in the industry.""

""It's really a transformation of business"" he told reporters. ""There is demand for a Bentley EV.""

Bentley's EXP 100 GT concept car could provide additional clues about the company's plans. The svelte radically-looking grand tourer incorporates sustainable materials and comes programmed with autonomous electric driving technology. The battery-electric powertrain propels the EXP 100 GT from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds according to Bentley.

General Motors

The auto giant has not done away with internal combustion engines -- yet.

The Detroit automaker laid out its bullish plans for electric vehicles in January vowing that 40% of U.S. models will be battery electric vehicles by the end of 2025.

By 2035 the majority of GM vehicles sold will be EVs.

GM's large masculine pickup trucks have been reliable moneymakers for the company and consumer demand for these gas-guzzlers skyrocketed in the spring and summer.

Anticipation for GM's reborn all-electric Hummer slated for the 2022 model year has not waned since its debut last October.

2022 GMC Hummer EV General Motors

The company drummed up interest in the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq with its entertaining Super Bowl ads. And GM's small Bolt hatchback got a redesign along with a sibling the Bolt EUV (electric utility vehicle) for 2022. Global sales of the Bolt EV have topped 100000 since its market launch in 2017.

These vehicles are part of GM's road map of launching 30 new EVs globally by 2025.

More EVs

Automakers worldwide are busy readying their EV models for motorists. German luxury automaker Audi recently introduced its 2022 e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT two high-performance electric cars that pack 522 horsepower and 637 hp respectively.

Volkswagen's new compact ID.4 promises to be a serious challenger to the top-selling Tesla Model 3. All-electric automaker Rivian has been testing its $67500 R1T truck in Arizona's desert; the truck can get 300+ miles of range on a full charge.

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

PARLER INTERIM CEO SAYS TRUMP BIDEN WELCOME ON PLATFORM

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

GOOGLE TO EVALUATE EXECUTIVES ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Mr. Biden has signaled that he supports rescinding the broad legal immunity that tech firms currently enjoy for information carried over their networks.

As the Biden administration settles in tech companies are awaiting key picks for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division head. The appointments could determine how aggressively the government handles existing investigations or bringing about new ones advisers to the companies said.

The Journal's analysis is based on the latest Federal Election Commission data covering the 2020 election cycle for Mr. Biden's campaign two joint fundraising committees and individual donations to those committees made through the online donation platform ActBlue. The Journal examined campaign-finance data to compile a list of companies whose employees donated the most money.

The analysis relied on a standardized version of the self-reported employer information on each donation and should be treated as an estimate because some of the public records are incomplete or flawed.

FACEBOOK TO EXPAND EFFORT TO COMBAT CLIMATE MISINFORMATION LABEL POSTS

Because online donation platforms that itemize even the smallest contribution weren't as widely used in 2016 and 2012 data for previous years include information only on donors who gave more than $200 to a campaign.

About two-thirds of the money in presidential races is donated to candidates from individuals who could give up to $2800 to a candidate for the recent election. Those who donate $200 or more are required to disclose the names of their employers.

While corporations are prohibited from making financial donations to candidates for national office many companies operate political-action committees or PACs which are employee-funded accounts that companies use to donate money to favored candidates. Relatively little money in presidential elections comes from corporate PACs. Labor unions spend millions of dollars each election to support Democratic candidates.

Technology employees made donations to other political entities that worked to elect Mr. Biden and other Democrats including Future Forward USA PAC which spent millions of dollars on the 2020 election.

Mr. Biden's campaign according to the Journal's analysis received $3.7 million from employees of five of the largest Wall Street firms: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. Bank of America Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. In prior elections those firms ranked among the top sources of money for the Democratic presidential candidate records show.

That was less than the total contributed to Mr. Biden by employees of Alphabet who donated $5.3 million making the tech company the No. 1 source of money the Journal analysis shows.

Google employees were the top source of donations to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign and the second-largest source of money for Mr. Obama's 2012 race.

Employees of Amazon contributed a total of $2.8 million to Mr. Biden's campaign. Amazon was the third-largest source of money among companies to Mr. Biden in the election. The company hadn't been a big source of campaign money for prior Democratic candidates records show.

Microsoft employees have long been a top source of money for Democratic presidential candidates. Microsoft employees donated $3.2 million to Mr. Biden in the election.

Facebook employees have emerged as a top source of money donating $1.9 million to his campaign records show.

Other top sources of money for Mr. Biden were employees of Lowercase Capital Oracle Corp. Netflix Inc. Saban Capital Group and Morgan & Morgan the data analyzed by the Journal shows. Lowercase Capital is a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in Twitter Uber Technologies Inc. and Instagram now part of Facebook.

The Boxxer is a fork that has been around for a very long time in many different guises. RockShox divides the Boxxer into the Select and Ultimate versions with the latter and top tier version being the one we tested.



The Boxxer runs on 35mm diameter stanchions and follows the company’s ideals of user friendliness throughout the chassis.

The Boxxer's Maxle system bolts it in from side and uses a wedge system to stop the axle threads from undoing. While not always the starting point for fork setup the markings on the fork do help when you're setting up via sag rather than suggested pressure.

The air spring in the Boxxer uses screw-in volume spacers to adjust the ramp up characteristics. They all snug together with an 8mm hex tool. The Charger 2.1 damper has externally adjustable high and low speed compression with low speed rebound adjustable at the bottom of the fork.

Fox 40 Factory



For 2021 the Fox 40 received quite some tweaks all round which we’ll go into. The name also got tweaked a little with the 49 name being dropped and the whole DH fork range be it for 27.5” or 29” wheels now called just the 40.



Following the naming of Fox’s forks it’s easy to understand that it uses 40mm diameter stanchions. And in the case of the Factory version that we tested they’re Kashima.

For 2021 the 40's crown got a complete redesign to add clearance tune stiffness. The 40 also uses a pinch bolt axle system to securely hold the axle while allowing everything to be aligned. There's a small replaceable threaded part for the 4 pinch bolts too.

Like the Boxxer the 40 uses plastic volume spacers for ramp adjustment. But these ones snap together without the need for a tool. The Grip 2 damper has externally adjustable high and low speed compression and rebound damping along with a new internal design for the high speed adjustment.

Öhlins DH38 m.1



Like the Boxxer and 40 the DH38 from Öhlins isn’t an “all new” fork. The m.1 suffix indicating the second iteration of DH fork from the Swedish manufacturer. And while from a distance it may look the same as the company’s DH Race fork it’s a whole different beast with changes throughout it.



There are no prizes for guessing the stanchion diameter. 38mm if you somehow guessed wrong.

There's a bit of separation between the fork and crowns when buying the DH38 alowing you to get exactly the fork offset you're after. It's a similar pinch bolt axle system to the Fox 40 just with two less bolts. It still has small replaceable threaded parts for the pinch bolts though.

Adjusting the ramp of the fork is done with air pressure via the valve at the bottom of the fork. There's externally adjustable high and low speed compression damping with low speed rebound at the bottom of the TTX damper.

Verdict

If you’re an avid reader of Pinkbike then you’re probably aware of the outcome of this test. But play along and maybe you’ll learn something on the way there. Just don’t forget to act surprised when you get to the end.For everyone else we’re continuing our DH Bike Week with a head-to-head-to-head of three of the biggest DH forks out there at the moment. Over the course of the entire summer and autumn seasons as well as some choice dry spells in the winter season we tested these three forks across four different DH bikes to find out which one came out on top.There’s a pinch bolt-less Maxle axle system that bolts the axle into the fork from one side and then uses a wedge system to splay the axle end apart to resist undoing. It’s a 20mm diameter axle with a 110mm width and interestingly doesn’t use the Torque Cap system that the rest of the RockShox range uses.Sag markings are printed on the stanchions something that RockShox has patented and make it a doddle to set up the fork if you’re running something different to the recommended settings. In an effort to reduce the friction in the fork RockShox used SKF wiper seals along with fresh fluids in the damper.The Boxxer is available in 29” and 27.5” wheel sizes. There’s a 36mm and 46mm offset available for the small wheel version and 46mm and 56mm available for the big wheel version.There are a few travel options too – 180mm 190mm and 200mm which allow the Boxxer to be applicable to not only DH bikes but also some bigger travel bikes that usually sport a single crown. Our 200mm travel Boxxer has a 602mm axle to crown.It’s a 200mm post mount for the brake with a max rotor size up at 220mm. But that brake mount is following the Boost DH standard so you might need a 5mm spacer behind the disc if you have an older non-Boost DH hub.The Boxxer uses RockShox’s DebonAir air spring system which is on the face of it a very similar system used in all of RockShox’s forks with the dual chamber system auto equalising through travel via a moulded dimple on the inside of the stanchion.The air spring is tunable via screw in volume spacers that use an 8mm hex tool to snug them into one another and the top cap. The max number of tokens is 6 for all the travel options with only the number of tokens coming installed from the factory changing with travel. Max air pressure is 200psi.The Boxxer Ultimate uses the latest Charger 2.1 sealed damper cartridge that has externally adjustable high and low speed compression at the top of the fork with low speed rebound adjustment at the bottom. There are 4 clicks of high-speed compression 18 of low-speed compression and 18 of rebound.Our Boxxer Ultimate came in at 2588g the lightest in the test. It’s 2071g for the fork and 517g for the crowns. Setup was - 29” / 56mm offset / flat crown / 162mm steerer / no star nut / 1 token.The Boxxer Ultimate costs €1890 or $1699 USD making it the least expensive if you're paying in USD.Much like the 38 and 36 the 40 saw a redesigned crown to offset it further forwards and more out of the way of the frame. But it carried over the pinch bolt axle and lower leg bleeders from the previous version which also found their way onto the 38 and 36. There’s also the lower leg channels that allow the bath oil to circulate up to the upper bushing during fork use keeping everything well lubricated.That floating axle system tightens the axle up against the brake side lower leg pinches it off and then allows the opposite leg to float and find its perfect position to align the lowers and stanchions for smooth movement. It’s then pinched to the axle via two 5mm bolts. There are replaceable threaded pars for the axle pinch bolts too.It’s a 203mm post mount brake with the max rotor size up at 230mm. It follows the Boost DH standard too. The 40 is available in 203mm travel and 29” and 27.5” dedicated forks. But Fox actually offers four different crown offsets from 44mm to 56mm along with a flat and drop top crown in every offset.There’s actually a 190mm air spring assembly available too giving an option for a slightly shorter 40 if you so wish. Our 203mm travel 40 has an axle to crown of 601.9mm.There’s a Fox bolt on mudguard available for the 40 that uses the two bolt holes in the back of the crown and forgoes the spacers behind the back of the air bleeders on the lowers.The EVOL or extra volume air spring is again a familiar system from the previous version of the 40 and still uses the two self-equalising chamber system with the ability to snap in volume spacers to change the air spring characteristics. For 2021 it got updated though to have larger positive and negative chamber volumes.Max volume spacers are 5 for the 200mm travel fork and 7 for the 190mm version. Max air pressure is up at 120psi.If you’re familiar with Fox then you’ll recognise the 40 using the company’s latest Grip2 damper with external adjustments for high and low speed rebound and compression. This latest version of the damper uses a small propeller shaped mechanism to adjust the force on the piston’s shim stack and so adjust the high-speed compression and rebound dubbed VVC. There are 8 clicks of adjustment on the high-speed circuits and 16 clicks on the low-speed circuits.Our 40 Factory came in at 2770g. It’s 2245g for the forks and 525g for the crowns. Setup was - 29” / 56mm offset / drop crown / 162mm steerer / no star nut / 2 tokens.The Fox 40 Factory costs a whopping €2299 or $1749 USD making it the most expensive in the test if you're paying in Euros.The DH38 uses the same lowers for for 29” and 27.5” wheels and when you purchase the fork it’s as two separate parts – the fork and the crowns. The latter having four different offsets from 46mm to 58mm in 4mm increments. Flat and drop crowns are available - the flat is associated with a 27.5” wheel and the drop crown with a 29” wheel.The axle system on the DH38 is the same as the Fox 40 with only the exception of one bolt per leg instead of two. The principle also being the same in allowing good alignment between the lowers and stanchions no matter the tolerance on the hub width. There are replaceable threaded pars for the axle pinch bolts too.The DH38 is available in 180mm and 200mm travel full fork versions but there are air spring options for as little as 120mm meaning you can have that dual crown directness on almost any bike you want. It’s also approved for ebikes.It’s a 200mm post mount for the brake and uses the Boost DH standard. Our 200mm travel version had a minimum axle to crown of 608mm for 29” and 590mm for 27.5”.While the RockShox and Fox air springs might be somewhat similar in design the Öhlins one is a little bit different. The two self-equalising chamber design is there but there’s a third ramp chamber accessible at the bottom of the fork that allows the fork’s ramp up characteristics to be changed via air pressure and so with much more resolution than the fixed volume tokens on the Boxxer and 40. It’s a sealed cartridge too meaning you can disassemble it from the fork without having to take the air pressure out.There’s a new ramp chamber tube in the air spring to help with longer service intervals and all three chambers can actually be altered in volume via spacers but it’s a more involved job to do than on the RockShox and Fox forks and is only something that would need doing if you have some really specific requirements.The damper in the DH38 takes a lot of inspiration from the RXF36 m.2 trail and enduro fork and benefits from the refinements to the one-way valves that control the oil flow inside the twin tube damper. It also uses the same piston design and low speed damping needle for the compression and rebound circuits to increase adjustability.There’s externally adjustable high and low speed compression and low speed rebound damping adjustment. Those adjusters now having a bit more of a defined click to them to help identify where you are in the range. There are 3 clicks of high-speed compression 17 clicks of low-speed compression and 16 clicks of low-speed rebound.Our DH38 m.1 came in at 2822g the heaviest on test. It’s 2379g for the forks and 443g for the crowns. Setup was - 50mm offset / drop crown / 162mm steerer / no star nut.The DH38 m.1 retails for €1443 or $1600 USD for the fork and €316 or $350 USD for the crowns making it the most expensive in our test if you're paying in USD but the least expensive if you're paying in Euros.Boxxer setup is pretty quick and easy. Along with that there’s some very good setup and user manuals from RockShox to help with installation setup explaining the different adjustments and providing somewhere to note down your setups.The wheel bolts in fast and there are recommended air spring pressures printed on the side of the fork. There’s also the TrailHead tool online or via the app which uses the fork’s serial number to output the starting pressure and rebound for your weight.The sticker suggested 118psi working from the rider weight ranges that it displays. The TrailHead app directly suggested 118psi with 9 clicks of rebound from fully closed.Lots of the Boxxers on the DH bikes we tested came with 1 volume spacer installed and I started like this.There’s a few more bolts to turn on the 40 to get the wheel in. But it doesn’t take much longer to do. There’s also recommended settings printed on the fork with air pressure and settings for the low and high speed rebound.Fox also provides documentation for 40 setup and adjusting along with technical drawings and all relevant part information and numbers should you need any bits and pieces.Working from the rider weight ranges again it suggested 70psi for a 75kg rider half way between the 68-82kg range. Accompanying that was 7 clicks of low and high speed rebound from fully closed.The 40 came stock with 2 volume spacers installed and that is where I started.The DH38 uses the same axle system as the 40 just with 2 less bolts. And it too has printed recommended settings on the side of the fork for the three air chambers.It suggested 108psi in the main chamber and 215-230psi in the ramp chamber. I started at 215psi.Öhlins also has a Performance Suspension Guide that uses your bike brand and model along with your weight and suspension preference to output all the applicable components along with suggested starting points in setup. It suggested 110psi in the main chamber and 215psi in the ramp chamber.There’s also good documentation along with the fork about installation setup and adjustment along with instructional videos available through the website.The Boxxer actually came specced on three of the four bikes in our recent DH bike group test giving me a lot of time in on it.Set up to the recommended setting of 115psi it became immediately apparent that something needed to change. There’s really a lot of movement in and out of the travel all the time and this was the character trait that defined the Boxxer throughout testing. Pressure was quickly upped to 130psi and the total number of tokens to 3 from the stock 1. That also warranted more rebound damping to control the bigger spring.With this setup the fork performed a lot better. It brought more composure to the front of the bike and really helped when riding fast through rough undulating terrain. But that trait is still there and something that needs more arm movement and more thought to account for. Creeping up the compression damping again helped to calm this erratic movement a little more but did bring a bit more harshness into the equation.I experimented with even firmer pressures up at 140 and 145psi but this was now beginning to be too much. It pushed the harshness of the fork too high from solely the spring and balancing with less compression damping didn’t do the trick. Each time I experimented I came back to 130psi and the compression not too far from fully closed as the best balance of spring and damping to reduce the big fork oscillations as much as possible.I’ve received flack in the past from internet comments about too firm settings in suspension. But living in front of a World Cup level race track does demand some meat in the setup and this over-springing is something that many a friend with a Boxxer has had to do to calm that character trait along with all the testers that were on the Boxxer equipped DH bikes we tested.Because it needs that much spring to deal with its main issue it means that it won’t be the supplest of forks through the impacts. You’re somewhat forced into one of two camps with it. One being to run it softer in spring and damping to have a nice supple feel but then having a lot more fork movement when things get rough and choppy. The other being the camp that I settled in forgoing that suppleness for some control.Now the Boxxer is a good fork it’s easy to adjust the adjustments result in a noticeable feeling it’s easy to work on and does perform well. But it’s a fork that requires more of your concentration when riding to use your arms more in the suspension equation and if you prefer to run it on the firmer side grip a little bit harder when you hit through the rough stuff.Another point to mention is the fork width on the Boxxer. It’s a fair bit narrower than the other forks here and does increase the turning circle on a lot of bikes quite noticeably especially on bikes with very prominent fork bumpers or wide tubes. For those of you thinking about putting a Boxxer on your enduro bike god forbid it might be something to keep in mind. I also had more than one occasion where the whole axle became undone and started to unscrew out of the fork while riding. It never came completely out and it was pretty quickly recognisable from the wheel rattle at the front but it prompted me to check the axles on the Boxxers a little more than often.And while the Boxxer is available in two different offsets for the 29” version it's only the longest 56mm version that we saw on the bikes and might actually be too long as we’ll explain more about in the Fox 40 and especially Öhlins DH38.The 40 in comparison to the Boxxer is a fork that doesn’t force you into a corner of setup. Although like any fork its setup does also depend on how the rear suspension of the bike is working and behaving.Fitted to the Cube TWO15 that we’ve recently reviewed  it needed a slightly softer setup closer to the recommended settings to complement the softer feeling from the rear of the Cube that had generally more suspension movement in it. Running the fork firm on this bike pushed the rider weight too far back and resulted in some issues. In its softer setting it did exhibit obviously a bit more movement but that matched the very progressive rear suspension of the Cube.Running it on a bike with a lot more chassis support in the rear meant that the fork could be run a bit firmer to then complement the rear suspension feel more. On the likes of the Canyon Sender I could run more air in the spring and more tokens while still having a fork that maintained an impressive amount of suppleness. There will often be a trade off in support vs suppleness but on the 40 that gap is a lot smaller and it’s soft and absorbent when you need it to be and then hard and supportive when you need that.But its ability to adapt to each of those bikes while still having a high level of performance was noticeable and much appreciated when swapping it from one bike to another.As I’ve mentioned I do prefer a slightly stiffer fork. And with the 40 setup a bit firmer it really starts to disappear underneath you on the more demanding tracks leaving you with only the faint damping schlurp noise to remind you that it’s working. That trait to disappear meaning that you could put your focus more on the riding and not having to ride around any unfavourable traits in the fork’s working.That firmer setup did put it further away from the recommended settings and is something echoed by friends and other testers on the 40 who were often up at 90psi and with more tokens in there too. But the fork's suppleness and feel weren’t compromised by this up in pressure.It is a long fork though especially in the 29” guise and this is something true of all the 29” downhill forks we tested. Depending on your rider height headtube length and bar height preferences it can make getting a low bar height tricky.There are a lot of adjusters on the 40 but if you’re confident in knowing their purpose you have some wonderful windows of adjustability with the 40 both in compression and rebound. On the flip side if you’re not familiar with what each dial does then it’s an easy process to bracket each one at a time to understand the difference in feeling and how that affects the ride.There’s also adjustability in the crowns with the 40. Both our test forks had the longest 56mm and as we’ll go into with the Öhlins where we had the opportunity to test the different offsets I’d actually prefer the 52mm offset that Fox offers for its balance of cornering grip versus understeer. But it’s another positive for the 40 to offer this level of adjustability.And then we get to the Öhlins. Those loveable traits exhibited by the Fox 40 almost turned up another notch when you rode the DH38. This really is a suspension product that completely vanishes underneath you so good is its performance and it often left me speechless at the bottom of the run. I honestly spent a lot of time staring at this fork wondering how it had not only allowed me to just get away with murder but somewhat incited me to do it.Out of the box and with exactly the recommended air pressure settings the fork exhibits brilliant sensitivity that really takes the sting off any hits that would definitely be felt more through the likes of the Boxxer. When the ferocity of the trail increases then so does the composure of the fork. You push it harder on a run it just gives you more back and you end up in this constant one-up battle with it to see where its limits are. Spoiler I don’t think it has any. That transition and build from buttery smooth to creamy supportive is class leading and really addictive.The DH38 never seems to get flustered dealing with every impact or scenario just once and then moving on to the next. All the while it providing you with a crystal-clear path of information to what’s going on at the front contact patch. This is something that the Fox 40 also does really well but on the DH38 it’s like there’s less interference in the phone line. It really is a fork that lifts your gaze when riding leaving you to focus on nothing but the trail in front of you which is coming up mightily fast.Each adjuster definitely does have more of a defined click to it now to let you know where you are in the range. Each one of those clicks creating a palpable change in fork feel and in the direction that you intended. There’s no second guessing adjustments and even though there are overall less clicks than some of the other forks on test the range is wonderfully usable.Another favourable part of the DH38 is its ability to adjust the ramp characteristics of the fork. Using air instead of plastic tokens as the main adjustment gives a finer resolution and even running the ramp chamber up at 220 230 and 240psi it still maintains the wonderful sensitivity at the beginning of the travel. That up in ramp pressure providing more support for some of the more demanding tracks like Morgins and the hugely sculpted jump trails in Chatel.That adjustability also extends to the fork’s offset. Öhlins being kind enough to send us a bunch of different crowns to experiment with. Down at the shortest of 46mm there seems to be a bit more tucking of the front wheel when you turn it. You initiate the turn and the bars keep wanting to turn past the point that you need to make it round the corner.Out at the other end with 58mm offset there’s a tendency of the front wheel to understeer in the turns especially in high-speed flatter turns. It’s not a snap movement but there’s more push from the front end which isn’t the nicest of feelings for confidence when you’re riding fast.Coming into the two middle settings of 50mm and 54mm it’s the 50mm that I found to be my favourite. That tucking trait was substantially reduced and so too was the understeer feeling in the fast flat turns. Using the 54mm brought a bit of that feeling back and I found myself coming back to the 50mm.The Boxxer is a really easy fork to work on to keep it running well. Lower leg services are a cinch very similar to every other RockShox fork and advised every 50 hours.It needs 10ml 0w-30 in both lower legs and 3ml in the air spring along with a bit of grease around the piston seals.Every 200 hours RockShox recommends a full fork service which they do explain how to do in the service manual  but is a little more involved and requires some more specific tools than the lower leg service. You’re directed straight to all relevant service and upgrade parts for your Boxxer through the TrailHead tool.Fox says to do a full fork service every 125 hours or yearly whichever comes first. And if you ride a lot and in extreme conditions a lot then you’re urged to do this earlier.It’s also not a tricky procedure at all to do a lower leg service with Fox having online documents for oil volumes for the lower legs along with service manuals for damper and air spring rebuilds.It needs 35ml of Fox 20wt Gold oil in the air side lower leg and 6ml in the air spring itself. Then 50ml Fox 5wt Teflon Infused oil in the damper side lower leg.Öhlins suggest doing a lower leg service every 50 hours and now have the service kits and instructions available to the public. It needs 10ml Renep CGLP 68 fork lube in both lower legs which is a bit less than the other forks so it’s advised to stick to that 50-hour service interval to keep it running perfectly.A full fork rebuild is recommended every 100 hours or yearly whichever comes first and this is also something Öhlins now document how to do for the lowers and air spring although it does need some more specific tools. The damper also needs servicing at this interval and this is something that Öhlins still recommends to have done by an official service centre.The RockShox Boxxer is the lightest of the forks we tested by quite a margin. And while it is a good fork that a lot of people can get along with it does have a glaring character trait that can push you to a corner in setup.The new Fox 40 is sublime and is another step forward from what already was a great previous fork. Its ability to blend together suppleness and support all while being adaptable to how the rear suspension of your bike or yourself is behaving is brilliant and easy to do. Every year it seems hard to see how the big brands can improve upon the last version but Fox have taken the new 40 to be right up there and battling with the very best in the pack.But what the 40 does so well the Öhlins DH38 m.1 does just that little bit better and makes this truly a special fork. If you want a dual crown fork that blends smoothness and support like no other all the while egging you on to ride faster push harder and pull further then look no further than the DH38. It is heavier and more expensive than the competition if you're paying in USD. If you're paying in Euros then it's actually the least expensive. But any concerns on weight and price metrics are out the window when you ride it. And for these reasons it earned the title of Suspension Product of the Year 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwMzgzNDczL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Michael Joseph Peters,"Michael Joseph Peters

""This will likely mean that some airplanes will be removed from service"" Dickson said in a statement posted to Twitter.

According to the FAA aviation safety experts are meeting into the evening with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing to finalize the details of the order and any accompanying service bulletins in order to ensure that the appropriate airplanes are included. Exact details of the inspection will be specified in the emergency order.

Dickson added that the agency is ""working closely with other civil aviation authorities to make this information available to affected operators in their jurisdictions.”

UNITED FLIGHT'S ENGINE CATCHES FIRE AFTER DENVER TAKEOFF RETURNS TO AIRPORT SAFELY

The move comes in response to United Airlines flight 328 which experienced an engine failure after taking off from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The airplane landed safely after dropping debris over northern Colorado officials said.

The Boeing 777 was heading from Denver to Honolulu with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard when its right engine failed and erupted in flames. The plane quickly lost altitude and dropped huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass onto the neighborhoods below. Authorities said no injuries were reported aboard the plane or on the ground where debris fell.

""We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident"" Dickson said. ""Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Boeing said in a statement that it is ""actively monitoring recent events related to United Airlines Flight 328"" and that while an investigation into the incident by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway it recommends ""suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines until the FAA identifies the appropriate inspection protocol.""

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a Sunday evening investigation update that an intitial examination indicated that the airplane sustained minor damage most of which was ""confined to the number 2 engine.""

Investigators noted that the inlet a duct which is required to ensure smooth airflow into the engine and a cowling the removable metal covering that houses the engine were separated from the engine. In addition two fan blades were fractured while the remainder of the blades exhibited damage to their tips and leading edges.

The NTSB added that investigators continue to examine the engine airplane and the photographs and video taken by passengers aboard United flight 328 and that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were transported to the agency's laboratory in Washington where each will be downloaded and analyzed.

According to the most recent registry data airlines in only three countries operate airplanes with the affected engines: the United States Japan and South Korea. United Airlines the only U.S. operator with this type of engine in its fleet said it would ground the affected planes immediately.

""Starting immediately and out of an abundance of caution we are voluntarily and temporarily removing 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from our schedule. Since yesterday we’ve been in touch with regulators at the NTSB and FAA and will continue to work closely with them to determine any additional steps that are needed to ensure these aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards and can return to service"" a United spokesperson told FOX Business in a statement. ""As we swap out aircraft we expect only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.”

In addition to its 24 active aircrafts United has 28 additional Boeing 777s in storage.

""Safety remains our highest priority - for our employees and our customers"" the spokesperson added. ""That’s why our pilots and flight attendants take part in extensive training to prepare and manage incidents like United flight 328. And we remain proud of their professionalism and steadfast dedication to safety in our day to day operations and when emergencies like this occur.""

The FAA said it was also aware that the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau has directed operators equipped with this type of engine to cease flying in Japan until further notice. A Japan Airlines flight taking off from Naha Airport in Okinawa to Haneda Airport in Tokyo made an emergency landing for similar Boeing 777 engine trouble in December.

Fox News' Matthew Reidy contributed to this report",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9pcy1za3ktbmV3cy1zaGlmdGluZy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXBvbGl0aWNzLXRvLXRoZS1yaWdodC1ub3QteWV0LWJ1dC10aGVyZS1pcy1jYXVzZS1mb3ItYWxhcm0tMTU1MzU20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Sky News shifting Australian politics to the right? Not yet but there is cause for alarm,"In his submission to the current Senate inquiry into media diversity in Australia former prime minister Kevin Rudd warns that Rupert Murdoch’s Sky News Australia is following the template laid down by Murdoch’s Fox News in the United States to radicalise Australian politics. In a decade’s time Rudd argues we will see its full impact.

Given the destructive effect of Fox News on the functioning of American democracy Rudd’s is an alarming prediction.

Whether it comes to pass however is another matter. Certainly there are several danger signs that it might but there are also a few factors pointing the other way.

Read more: Can Fox News survive without Trump in the White House?

There are three big danger signs.

One is the unconstrained peddling of extreme right-wing propaganda lies disinformation crude distortion of fact and baseless assertions that occurs each night on Sky News.

Here is a brief sample: Rowan Dean’s and Alan Jones’s repeated ravings about the “stolen” US election; Peta Credlin’s false claim that Rudd’s petition for a Murdoch royal commission was an exercise in data-harvesting for which she had to apologise as part of a confidential defamation settlement; Jones’s disinformation about mask-wearing; James Morrow calling the Trump impeachment trial a “sinister plot by Democrats against the American people”.

Glenn Hunt/AAP

The second big danger sign is the way Sky News has been able to extend its reach from a niche pay-TV base to free-to-air television via 30 WIN regional stations across Australia and then through social media to the world.

After seeing its audience grow in the first half of 2020 Sky’s pay-TV audience ended the year shrinking. But being on free-to-air TV in regional Australia represents an opportunity for growth.

Data on current regional viewing levels are patchy and incomplete. However prime-time viewing is reported to have grown 36% in 2020 and is claimed to reach 2.9 million unique viewers.

Sky’s non-TV platform is social media. YouTube owned by Google is a very important social media outlet for Sky and that is where the viewer data reported here come from.

Facebook is also an important outlet. When Facebook blacked out Australian news on February 18 there were roughly 260000 views of Sky’s announcement of its last appearance there.

If Facebook persists in its blackout it will clearly damage Sky’s online reach.

The patterns of Sky News viewership on YouTube are revealing.

The big picture is that Sky’s Australian stories get tiny audiences but stories about the United States get vastly bigger ones suggesting Sky has developed a following in the US.

For instance an Alan Jones piece “Trump’s impeachment charge is ‘more Pelosi rubbish’ ” got 130000 views.

And the right-wing US journalist Megyn Kelly’s piece “Trump exposed hidden media bias” got 467926 views.

Contrast these with Paul Murray’s local story “Daniel Andrews still playing us v them with quarantine”: about 30000 views and Peta Credlin’s “Net zero by 2050 is the ‘economic suicide note for workers’”: about 2000 views.

This tells us Sky is not only playing to a US as well as Australian audience but is tailoring its programming in ways that have worked for Fox News. At the same time it is siphoning into Australia the kind of content that has been so divisive in the US.

The growth profile of Fox News shows Murdoch plays a long game.

Fox News started in 1996. Pew Research Center data show it straight-lined near the bottom of the cable ratings in the US for five years took a jump at about the time of the September 11 attacks another at the time of the Iraq war in 2003 and thereafter cleared away from its main cable news rivals CNN and MSNBC.

Dan Himbrechts/AAP

Until the end of the Trump presidency Fox News was never headed – then after Trump lost it took a dive. In January 2021 it suffered its worst ratings in 20 years coming third behind CNN and MSNBC.

This symbiotic connection between an incumbent government and the Murdoch organisation brings us to the third big danger: the relationship between News Corporation in Australia and the Morrison government.

Morrison is not Trump. Yes he swaggered around in a baseball cap during the 2019 election campaign and yes he talks in slogans and sound bites. However the danger comes not from Morrison’s political persona but from the relationship he and his government have built with News Corporation.

On one reading it has become a commercial relationship between the government as client and News Corporation as provider of publicity services for a fee.

The fee has taken the form of two payments to Foxtel one of A$30 million in 2017 and one of A$10 million in 2020 ostensibly for TV coverage of under-represented women’s sport.

No tender process no publicly available information about the terms no way of knowing how this public money is being spent. Then recent technical glitches in the televising of W League matches prompted the Greens to ask the auditor-general to investigate.

Against these dangers are some mitigating factors.

One is that Australia’s compulsory voting system makes it very difficult for anyone to win an election with a primary vote that is not at least near the 40th percentile. A Trump-like “base” of 32% or so will not cut it here.

A second is that the religious right in Australia does not have the political clout it does in the US. Issues that excite the religious right such as abortion have been long settled here by the courts. The strong vote for marriage equality was another example of the broadly secular nature of our politics.

A third is that the Australian temperament is not on the whole excitable. While this means Australians are often excoriated as apathetic it also means they are not easily outraged.

A fourth is that Australia’s conservatism is of a largely materialistic kind. Franking credits matter. It is also a conservatism that does not like extremism. Morrison seems at last to have realised that outside their Facebook echo chambers the likes of Craig Kelly and George Christensen may be liabilities.

This pragmatic outlook among voters may prove to be a psychological bulwark against the firebrand reactionary politics promoted by Fox and Sky.

Having said that there are plenty of emotion-charged issues that give Sky the opportunity to drive wedges into the Australian body politic: asylum-seekers Muslims Aboriginal recognition African gangs Asians white supremacy the pandemic and above all climate change. Sky is into them all.

If anything concrete is to be done to head off the threat seen by Rudd it is going to involve public policy concerning media accountability of which a fit-and-proper-person test for television licensees would be an essential part.

However every attempt so far to exert meaningful accountability on the Australian media has come to nothing in the face of threats from the big media companies including News Corporation.

Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull as prime ministers were in a position to do something about this. Instead Rudd developed a friendship with the then editor-in-chief of The Australian and Turnbull made changes to the media ownership laws that empowered Murdoch even more.

It is futile to hope that the Morrison government engaged as it is in a highly questionable relationship with News Corporation will do anything about it. As for Labor leader Anthony Albanese when asked about a Murdoch royal commission he reached for the barge pole.

If this form of politics-as-usual persists then Rudd’s prediction cannot be discounted.

Then the nation would be relying on those qualities of the Australian character already mentioned. The question will be whether it will be enough.

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

PARLER INTERIM CEO SAYS TRUMP BIDEN WELCOME ON PLATFORM

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

GOOGLE TO EVALUATE EXECUTIVES ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Mr. Biden has signaled that he supports rescinding the broad legal immunity that tech firms currently enjoy for information carried over their networks.

As the Biden administration settles in tech companies are awaiting key picks for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division head. The appointments could determine how aggressively the government handles existing investigations or bringing about new ones advisers to the companies said.

The Journal's analysis is based on the latest Federal Election Commission data covering the 2020 election cycle for Mr. Biden's campaign two joint fundraising committees and individual donations to those committees made through the online donation platform ActBlue. The Journal examined campaign-finance data to compile a list of companies whose employees donated the most money.

The analysis relied on a standardized version of the self-reported employer information on each donation and should be treated as an estimate because some of the public records are incomplete or flawed.

FACEBOOK TO EXPAND EFFORT TO COMBAT CLIMATE MISINFORMATION LABEL POSTS

Because online donation platforms that itemize even the smallest contribution weren't as widely used in 2016 and 2012 data for previous years include information only on donors who gave more than $200 to a campaign.

About two-thirds of the money in presidential races is donated to candidates from individuals who could give up to $2800 to a candidate for the recent election. Those who donate $200 or more are required to disclose the names of their employers.

While corporations are prohibited from making financial donations to candidates for national office many companies operate political-action committees or PACs which are employee-funded accounts that companies use to donate money to favored candidates. Relatively little money in presidential elections comes from corporate PACs. Labor unions spend millions of dollars each election to support Democratic candidates.

Technology employees made donations to other political entities that worked to elect Mr. Biden and other Democrats including Future Forward USA PAC which spent millions of dollars on the 2020 election.

Mr. Biden's campaign according to the Journal's analysis received $3.7 million from employees of five of the largest Wall Street firms: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. Bank of America Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. In prior elections those firms ranked among the top sources of money for the Democratic presidential candidate records show.

That was less than the total contributed to Mr. Biden by employees of Alphabet who donated $5.3 million making the tech company the No. 1 source of money the Journal analysis shows.

Google employees were the top source of donations to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign and the second-largest source of money for Mr. Obama's 2012 race.

Employees of Amazon contributed a total of $2.8 million to Mr. Biden's campaign. Amazon was the third-largest source of money among companies to Mr. Biden in the election. The company hadn't been a big source of campaign money for prior Democratic candidates records show.

Microsoft employees have long been a top source of money for Democratic presidential candidates. Microsoft employees donated $3.2 million to Mr. Biden in the election.

Facebook employees have emerged as a top source of money donating $1.9 million to his campaign records show.

Other top sources of money for Mr. Biden were employees of Lowercase Capital Oracle Corp. Netflix Inc. Saban Capital Group and Morgan & Morgan the data analyzed by the Journal shows. Lowercase Capital is a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in Twitter Uber Technologies Inc. and Instagram now part of Facebook.

The Boxxer is a fork that has been around for a very long time in many different guises. RockShox divides the Boxxer into the Select and Ultimate versions with the latter and top tier version being the one we tested.



The Boxxer runs on 35mm diameter stanchions and follows the company’s ideals of user friendliness throughout the chassis.

The Boxxer's Maxle system bolts it in from side and uses a wedge system to stop the axle threads from undoing. While not always the starting point for fork setup the markings on the fork do help when you're setting up via sag rather than suggested pressure.

The air spring in the Boxxer uses screw-in volume spacers to adjust the ramp up characteristics. They all snug together with an 8mm hex tool. The Charger 2.1 damper has externally adjustable high and low speed compression with low speed rebound adjustable at the bottom of the fork.

Fox 40 Factory



For 2021 the Fox 40 received quite some tweaks all round which we’ll go into. The name also got tweaked a little with the 49 name being dropped and the whole DH fork range be it for 27.5” or 29” wheels now called just the 40.



Following the naming of Fox’s forks it’s easy to understand that it uses 40mm diameter stanchions. And in the case of the Factory version that we tested they’re Kashima.

For 2021 the 40's crown got a complete redesign to add clearance tune stiffness. The 40 also uses a pinch bolt axle system to securely hold the axle while allowing everything to be aligned. There's a small replaceable threaded part for the 4 pinch bolts too.

Like the Boxxer the 40 uses plastic volume spacers for ramp adjustment. But these ones snap together without the need for a tool. The Grip 2 damper has externally adjustable high and low speed compression and rebound damping along with a new internal design for the high speed adjustment.

Öhlins DH38 m.1



Like the Boxxer and 40 the DH38 from Öhlins isn’t an “all new” fork. The m.1 suffix indicating the second iteration of DH fork from the Swedish manufacturer. And while from a distance it may look the same as the company’s DH Race fork it’s a whole different beast with changes throughout it.



There are no prizes for guessing the stanchion diameter. 38mm if you somehow guessed wrong.

There's a bit of separation between the fork and crowns when buying the DH38 alowing you to get exactly the fork offset you're after. It's a similar pinch bolt axle system to the Fox 40 just with two less bolts. It still has small replaceable threaded parts for the pinch bolts though.

Adjusting the ramp of the fork is done with air pressure via the valve at the bottom of the fork. There's externally adjustable high and low speed compression damping with low speed rebound at the bottom of the TTX damper.

Verdict

If you’re an avid reader of Pinkbike then you’re probably aware of the outcome of this test. But play along and maybe you’ll learn something on the way there. Just don’t forget to act surprised when you get to the end.For everyone else we’re continuing our DH Bike Week with a head-to-head-to-head of three of the biggest DH forks out there at the moment. Over the course of the entire summer and autumn seasons as well as some choice dry spells in the winter season we tested these three forks across four different DH bikes to find out which one came out on top.There’s a pinch bolt-less Maxle axle system that bolts the axle into the fork from one side and then uses a wedge system to splay the axle end apart to resist undoing. It’s a 20mm diameter axle with a 110mm width and interestingly doesn’t use the Torque Cap system that the rest of the RockShox range uses.Sag markings are printed on the stanchions something that RockShox has patented and make it a doddle to set up the fork if you’re running something different to the recommended settings. In an effort to reduce the friction in the fork RockShox used SKF wiper seals along with fresh fluids in the damper.The Boxxer is available in 29” and 27.5” wheel sizes. There’s a 36mm and 46mm offset available for the small wheel version and 46mm and 56mm available for the big wheel version.There are a few travel options too – 180mm 190mm and 200mm which allow the Boxxer to be applicable to not only DH bikes but also some bigger travel bikes that usually sport a single crown. Our 200mm travel Boxxer has a 602mm axle to crown.It’s a 200mm post mount for the brake with a max rotor size up at 220mm. But that brake mount is following the Boost DH standard so you might need a 5mm spacer behind the disc if you have an older non-Boost DH hub.The Boxxer uses RockShox’s DebonAir air spring system which is on the face of it a very similar system used in all of RockShox’s forks with the dual chamber system auto equalising through travel via a moulded dimple on the inside of the stanchion.The air spring is tunable via screw in volume spacers that use an 8mm hex tool to snug them into one another and the top cap. The max number of tokens is 6 for all the travel options with only the number of tokens coming installed from the factory changing with travel. Max air pressure is 200psi.The Boxxer Ultimate uses the latest Charger 2.1 sealed damper cartridge that has externally adjustable high and low speed compression at the top of the fork with low speed rebound adjustment at the bottom. There are 4 clicks of high-speed compression 18 of low-speed compression and 18 of rebound.Our Boxxer Ultimate came in at 2588g the lightest in the test. It’s 2071g for the fork and 517g for the crowns. Setup was - 29” / 56mm offset / flat crown / 162mm steerer / no star nut / 1 token.The Boxxer Ultimate costs €1890 or $1699 USD making it the least expensive if you're paying in USD.Much like the 38 and 36 the 40 saw a redesigned crown to offset it further forwards and more out of the way of the frame. But it carried over the pinch bolt axle and lower leg bleeders from the previous version which also found their way onto the 38 and 36. There’s also the lower leg channels that allow the bath oil to circulate up to the upper bushing during fork use keeping everything well lubricated.That floating axle system tightens the axle up against the brake side lower leg pinches it off and then allows the opposite leg to float and find its perfect position to align the lowers and stanchions for smooth movement. It’s then pinched to the axle via two 5mm bolts. There are replaceable threaded pars for the axle pinch bolts too.It’s a 203mm post mount brake with the max rotor size up at 230mm. It follows the Boost DH standard too. The 40 is available in 203mm travel and 29” and 27.5” dedicated forks. But Fox actually offers four different crown offsets from 44mm to 56mm along with a flat and drop top crown in every offset.There’s actually a 190mm air spring assembly available too giving an option for a slightly shorter 40 if you so wish. Our 203mm travel 40 has an axle to crown of 601.9mm.There’s a Fox bolt on mudguard available for the 40 that uses the two bolt holes in the back of the crown and forgoes the spacers behind the back of the air bleeders on the lowers.The EVOL or extra volume air spring is again a familiar system from the previous version of the 40 and still uses the two self-equalising chamber system with the ability to snap in volume spacers to change the air spring characteristics. For 2021 it got updated though to have larger positive and negative chamber volumes.Max volume spacers are 5 for the 200mm travel fork and 7 for the 190mm version. Max air pressure is up at 120psi.If you’re familiar with Fox then you’ll recognise the 40 using the company’s latest Grip2 damper with external adjustments for high and low speed rebound and compression. This latest version of the damper uses a small propeller shaped mechanism to adjust the force on the piston’s shim stack and so adjust the high-speed compression and rebound dubbed VVC. There are 8 clicks of adjustment on the high-speed circuits and 16 clicks on the low-speed circuits.Our 40 Factory came in at 2770g. It’s 2245g for the forks and 525g for the crowns. Setup was - 29” / 56mm offset / drop crown / 162mm steerer / no star nut / 2 tokens.The Fox 40 Factory costs a whopping €2299 or $1749 USD making it the most expensive in the test if you're paying in Euros.The DH38 uses the same lowers for for 29” and 27.5” wheels and when you purchase the fork it’s as two separate parts – the fork and the crowns. The latter having four different offsets from 46mm to 58mm in 4mm increments. Flat and drop crowns are available - the flat is associated with a 27.5” wheel and the drop crown with a 29” wheel.The axle system on the DH38 is the same as the Fox 40 with only the exception of one bolt per leg instead of two. The principle also being the same in allowing good alignment between the lowers and stanchions no matter the tolerance on the hub width. There are replaceable threaded pars for the axle pinch bolts too.The DH38 is available in 180mm and 200mm travel full fork versions but there are air spring options for as little as 120mm meaning you can have that dual crown directness on almost any bike you want. It’s also approved for ebikes.It’s a 200mm post mount for the brake and uses the Boost DH standard. Our 200mm travel version had a minimum axle to crown of 608mm for 29” and 590mm for 27.5”.While the RockShox and Fox air springs might be somewhat similar in design the Öhlins one is a little bit different. The two self-equalising chamber design is there but there’s a third ramp chamber accessible at the bottom of the fork that allows the fork’s ramp up characteristics to be changed via air pressure and so with much more resolution than the fixed volume tokens on the Boxxer and 40. It’s a sealed cartridge too meaning you can disassemble it from the fork without having to take the air pressure out.There’s a new ramp chamber tube in the air spring to help with longer service intervals and all three chambers can actually be altered in volume via spacers but it’s a more involved job to do than on the RockShox and Fox forks and is only something that would need doing if you have some really specific requirements.The damper in the DH38 takes a lot of inspiration from the RXF36 m.2 trail and enduro fork and benefits from the refinements to the one-way valves that control the oil flow inside the twin tube damper. It also uses the same piston design and low speed damping needle for the compression and rebound circuits to increase adjustability.There’s externally adjustable high and low speed compression and low speed rebound damping adjustment. Those adjusters now having a bit more of a defined click to them to help identify where you are in the range. There are 3 clicks of high-speed compression 17 clicks of low-speed compression and 16 clicks of low-speed rebound.Our DH38 m.1 came in at 2822g the heaviest on test. It’s 2379g for the forks and 443g for the crowns. Setup was - 50mm offset / drop crown / 162mm steerer / no star nut.The DH38 m.1 retails for €1443 or $1600 USD for the fork and €316 or $350 USD for the crowns making it the most expensive in our test if you're paying in USD but the least expensive if you're paying in Euros.Boxxer setup is pretty quick and easy. Along with that there’s some very good setup and user manuals from RockShox to help with installation setup explaining the different adjustments and providing somewhere to note down your setups.The wheel bolts in fast and there are recommended air spring pressures printed on the side of the fork. There’s also the TrailHead tool online or via the app which uses the fork’s serial number to output the starting pressure and rebound for your weight.The sticker suggested 118psi working from the rider weight ranges that it displays. The TrailHead app directly suggested 118psi with 9 clicks of rebound from fully closed.Lots of the Boxxers on the DH bikes we tested came with 1 volume spacer installed and I started like this.There’s a few more bolts to turn on the 40 to get the wheel in. But it doesn’t take much longer to do. There’s also recommended settings printed on the fork with air pressure and settings for the low and high speed rebound.Fox also provides documentation for 40 setup and adjusting along with technical drawings and all relevant part information and numbers should you need any bits and pieces.Working from the rider weight ranges again it suggested 70psi for a 75kg rider half way between the 68-82kg range. Accompanying that was 7 clicks of low and high speed rebound from fully closed.The 40 came stock with 2 volume spacers installed and that is where I started.The DH38 uses the same axle system as the 40 just with 2 less bolts. And it too has printed recommended settings on the side of the fork for the three air chambers.It suggested 108psi in the main chamber and 215-230psi in the ramp chamber. I started at 215psi.Öhlins also has a Performance Suspension Guide that uses your bike brand and model along with your weight and suspension preference to output all the applicable components along with suggested starting points in setup. It suggested 110psi in the main chamber and 215psi in the ramp chamber.There’s also good documentation along with the fork about installation setup and adjustment along with instructional videos available through the website.The Boxxer actually came specced on three of the four bikes in our recent DH bike group test giving me a lot of time in on it.Set up to the recommended setting of 115psi it became immediately apparent that something needed to change. There’s really a lot of movement in and out of the travel all the time and this was the character trait that defined the Boxxer throughout testing. Pressure was quickly upped to 130psi and the total number of tokens to 3 from the stock 1. That also warranted more rebound damping to control the bigger spring.With this setup the fork performed a lot better. It brought more composure to the front of the bike and really helped when riding fast through rough undulating terrain. But that trait is still there and something that needs more arm movement and more thought to account for. Creeping up the compression damping again helped to calm this erratic movement a little more but did bring a bit more harshness into the equation.I experimented with even firmer pressures up at 140 and 145psi but this was now beginning to be too much. It pushed the harshness of the fork too high from solely the spring and balancing with less compression damping didn’t do the trick. Each time I experimented I came back to 130psi and the compression not too far from fully closed as the best balance of spring and damping to reduce the big fork oscillations as much as possible.I’ve received flack in the past from internet comments about too firm settings in suspension. But living in front of a World Cup level race track does demand some meat in the setup and this over-springing is something that many a friend with a Boxxer has had to do to calm that character trait along with all the testers that were on the Boxxer equipped DH bikes we tested.Because it needs that much spring to deal with its main issue it means that it won’t be the supplest of forks through the impacts. You’re somewhat forced into one of two camps with it. One being to run it softer in spring and damping to have a nice supple feel but then having a lot more fork movement when things get rough and choppy. The other being the camp that I settled in forgoing that suppleness for some control.Now the Boxxer is a good fork it’s easy to adjust the adjustments result in a noticeable feeling it’s easy to work on and does perform well. But it’s a fork that requires more of your concentration when riding to use your arms more in the suspension equation and if you prefer to run it on the firmer side grip a little bit harder when you hit through the rough stuff.Another point to mention is the fork width on the Boxxer. It’s a fair bit narrower than the other forks here and does increase the turning circle on a lot of bikes quite noticeably especially on bikes with very prominent fork bumpers or wide tubes. For those of you thinking about putting a Boxxer on your enduro bike god forbid it might be something to keep in mind. I also had more than one occasion where the whole axle became undone and started to unscrew out of the fork while riding. It never came completely out and it was pretty quickly recognisable from the wheel rattle at the front but it prompted me to check the axles on the Boxxers a little more than often.And while the Boxxer is available in two different offsets for the 29” version it's only the longest 56mm version that we saw on the bikes and might actually be too long as we’ll explain more about in the Fox 40 and especially Öhlins DH38.The 40 in comparison to the Boxxer is a fork that doesn’t force you into a corner of setup. Although like any fork its setup does also depend on how the rear suspension of the bike is working and behaving.Fitted to the Cube TWO15 that we’ve recently reviewed  it needed a slightly softer setup closer to the recommended settings to complement the softer feeling from the rear of the Cube that had generally more suspension movement in it. Running the fork firm on this bike pushed the rider weight too far back and resulted in some issues. In its softer setting it did exhibit obviously a bit more movement but that matched the very progressive rear suspension of the Cube.Running it on a bike with a lot more chassis support in the rear meant that the fork could be run a bit firmer to then complement the rear suspension feel more. On the likes of the Canyon Sender I could run more air in the spring and more tokens while still having a fork that maintained an impressive amount of suppleness. There will often be a trade off in support vs suppleness but on the 40 that gap is a lot smaller and it’s soft and absorbent when you need it to be and then hard and supportive when you need that.But its ability to adapt to each of those bikes while still having a high level of performance was noticeable and much appreciated when swapping it from one bike to another.As I’ve mentioned I do prefer a slightly stiffer fork. And with the 40 setup a bit firmer it really starts to disappear underneath you on the more demanding tracks leaving you with only the faint damping schlurp noise to remind you that it’s working. That trait to disappear meaning that you could put your focus more on the riding and not having to ride around any unfavourable traits in the fork’s working.That firmer setup did put it further away from the recommended settings and is something echoed by friends and other testers on the 40 who were often up at 90psi and with more tokens in there too. But the fork's suppleness and feel weren’t compromised by this up in pressure.It is a long fork though especially in the 29” guise and this is something true of all the 29” downhill forks we tested. Depending on your rider height headtube length and bar height preferences it can make getting a low bar height tricky.There are a lot of adjusters on the 40 but if you’re confident in knowing their purpose you have some wonderful windows of adjustability with the 40 both in compression and rebound. On the flip side if you’re not familiar with what each dial does then it’s an easy process to bracket each one at a time to understand the difference in feeling and how that affects the ride.There’s also adjustability in the crowns with the 40. Both our test forks had the longest 56mm and as we’ll go into with the Öhlins where we had the opportunity to test the different offsets I’d actually prefer the 52mm offset that Fox offers for its balance of cornering grip versus understeer. But it’s another positive for the 40 to offer this level of adjustability.And then we get to the Öhlins. Those loveable traits exhibited by the Fox 40 almost turned up another notch when you rode the DH38. This really is a suspension product that completely vanishes underneath you so good is its performance and it often left me speechless at the bottom of the run. I honestly spent a lot of time staring at this fork wondering how it had not only allowed me to just get away with murder but somewhat incited me to do it.Out of the box and with exactly the recommended air pressure settings the fork exhibits brilliant sensitivity that really takes the sting off any hits that would definitely be felt more through the likes of the Boxxer. When the ferocity of the trail increases then so does the composure of the fork. You push it harder on a run it just gives you more back and you end up in this constant one-up battle with it to see where its limits are. Spoiler I don’t think it has any. That transition and build from buttery smooth to creamy supportive is class leading and really addictive.The DH38 never seems to get flustered dealing with every impact or scenario just once and then moving on to the next. All the while it providing you with a crystal-clear path of information to what’s going on at the front contact patch. This is something that the Fox 40 also does really well but on the DH38 it’s like there’s less interference in the phone line. It really is a fork that lifts your gaze when riding leaving you to focus on nothing but the trail in front of you which is coming up mightily fast.Each adjuster definitely does have more of a defined click to it now to let you know where you are in the range. Each one of those clicks creating a palpable change in fork feel and in the direction that you intended. There’s no second guessing adjustments and even though there are overall less clicks than some of the other forks on test the range is wonderfully usable.Another favourable part of the DH38 is its ability to adjust the ramp characteristics of the fork. Using air instead of plastic tokens as the main adjustment gives a finer resolution and even running the ramp chamber up at 220 230 and 240psi it still maintains the wonderful sensitivity at the beginning of the travel. That up in ramp pressure providing more support for some of the more demanding tracks like Morgins and the hugely sculpted jump trails in Chatel.That adjustability also extends to the fork’s offset. Öhlins being kind enough to send us a bunch of different crowns to experiment with. Down at the shortest of 46mm there seems to be a bit more tucking of the front wheel when you turn it. You initiate the turn and the bars keep wanting to turn past the point that you need to make it round the corner.Out at the other end with 58mm offset there’s a tendency of the front wheel to understeer in the turns especially in high-speed flatter turns. It’s not a snap movement but there’s more push from the front end which isn’t the nicest of feelings for confidence when you’re riding fast.Coming into the two middle settings of 50mm and 54mm it’s the 50mm that I found to be my favourite. That tucking trait was substantially reduced and so too was the understeer feeling in the fast flat turns. Using the 54mm brought a bit of that feeling back and I found myself coming back to the 50mm.The Boxxer is a really easy fork to work on to keep it running well. Lower leg services are a cinch very similar to every other RockShox fork and advised every 50 hours.It needs 10ml 0w-30 in both lower legs and 3ml in the air spring along with a bit of grease around the piston seals.Every 200 hours RockShox recommends a full fork service which they do explain how to do in the service manual  but is a little more involved and requires some more specific tools than the lower leg service. You’re directed straight to all relevant service and upgrade parts for your Boxxer through the TrailHead tool.Fox says to do a full fork service every 125 hours or yearly whichever comes first. And if you ride a lot and in extreme conditions a lot then you’re urged to do this earlier.It’s also not a tricky procedure at all to do a lower leg service with Fox having online documents for oil volumes for the lower legs along with service manuals for damper and air spring rebuilds.It needs 35ml of Fox 20wt Gold oil in the air side lower leg and 6ml in the air spring itself. Then 50ml Fox 5wt Teflon Infused oil in the damper side lower leg.Öhlins suggest doing a lower leg service every 50 hours and now have the service kits and instructions available to the public. It needs 10ml Renep CGLP 68 fork lube in both lower legs which is a bit less than the other forks so it’s advised to stick to that 50-hour service interval to keep it running perfectly.A full fork rebuild is recommended every 100 hours or yearly whichever comes first and this is also something Öhlins now document how to do for the lowers and air spring although it does need some more specific tools. The damper also needs servicing at this interval and this is something that Öhlins still recommends to have done by an official service centre.The RockShox Boxxer is the lightest of the forks we tested by quite a margin. And while it is a good fork that a lot of people can get along with it does have a glaring character trait that can push you to a corner in setup.The new Fox 40 is sublime and is another step forward from what already was a great previous fork. Its ability to blend together suppleness and support all while being adaptable to how the rear suspension of your bike or yourself is behaving is brilliant and easy to do. Every year it seems hard to see how the big brands can improve upon the last version but Fox have taken the new 40 to be right up there and battling with the very best in the pack.But what the 40 does so well the Öhlins DH38 m.1 does just that little bit better and makes this truly a special fork. If you want a dual crown fork that blends smoothness and support like no other all the while egging you on to ride faster push harder and pull further then look no further than the DH38. It is heavier and more expensive than the competition if you're paying in USD. If you're paying in Euros then it's actually the least expensive. But any concerns on weight and price metrics are out the window when you ride it. And for these reasons it earned the title of Suspension Product of the Year 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwMzgzNDczL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Michael Joseph Peters,"Michael Joseph Peters

""This will likely mean that some airplanes will be removed from service"" Dickson said in a statement posted to Twitter.

According to the FAA aviation safety experts are meeting into the evening with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing to finalize the details of the order and any accompanying service bulletins in order to ensure that the appropriate airplanes are included. Exact details of the inspection will be specified in the emergency order.

Dickson added that the agency is ""working closely with other civil aviation authorities to make this information available to affected operators in their jurisdictions.”

UNITED FLIGHT'S ENGINE CATCHES FIRE AFTER DENVER TAKEOFF RETURNS TO AIRPORT SAFELY

The move comes in response to United Airlines flight 328 which experienced an engine failure after taking off from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The airplane landed safely after dropping debris over northern Colorado officials said.

The Boeing 777 was heading from Denver to Honolulu with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard when its right engine failed and erupted in flames. The plane quickly lost altitude and dropped huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass onto the neighborhoods below. Authorities said no injuries were reported aboard the plane or on the ground where debris fell.

""We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident"" Dickson said. ""Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Boeing said in a statement that it is ""actively monitoring recent events related to United Airlines Flight 328"" and that while an investigation into the incident by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway it recommends ""suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines until the FAA identifies the appropriate inspection protocol.""

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a Sunday evening investigation update that an intitial examination indicated that the airplane sustained minor damage most of which was ""confined to the number 2 engine.""

Investigators noted that the inlet a duct which is required to ensure smooth airflow into the engine and a cowling the removable metal covering that houses the engine were separated from the engine. In addition two fan blades were fractured while the remainder of the blades exhibited damage to their tips and leading edges.

The NTSB added that investigators continue to examine the engine airplane and the photographs and video taken by passengers aboard United flight 328 and that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were transported to the agency's laboratory in Washington where each will be downloaded and analyzed.

According to the most recent registry data airlines in only three countries operate airplanes with the affected engines: the United States Japan and South Korea. United Airlines the only U.S. operator with this type of engine in its fleet said it would ground the affected planes immediately.

""Starting immediately and out of an abundance of caution we are voluntarily and temporarily removing 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from our schedule. Since yesterday we’ve been in touch with regulators at the NTSB and FAA and will continue to work closely with them to determine any additional steps that are needed to ensure these aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards and can return to service"" a United spokesperson told FOX Business in a statement. ""As we swap out aircraft we expect only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.”

The FAA said it was also aware that the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau has directed operators equipped with this type of engine to cease flying in Japan until further notice. A Japan Airlines flight taking off from Naha Airport in Okinawa to Haneda Airport in Tokyo made an emergency landing for similar Boeing 777 engine trouble in December.

Not yet but there is cause for alarm,"In his submission to the current Senate inquiry into media diversity in Australia former prime minister Kevin Rudd warns that Rupert Murdoch’s Sky News Australia is following the template laid down by Murdoch’s Fox News in the United States to radicalise Australian politics. In a decade’s time Rudd argues we will see its full impact.

Given the destructive effect of Fox News on the functioning of American democracy Rudd’s is an alarming prediction.

Whether it comes to pass however is another matter. Certainly there are several danger signs that it might but there are also a few factors pointing the other way.

Read more: Can Fox News survive without Trump in the White House?

There are three big danger signs.

One is the unconstrained peddling of extreme right-wing propaganda lies disinformation crude distortion of fact and baseless assertions that occurs each night on Sky News.

Here is a brief sample: Rowan Dean’s and Alan Jones’s repeated ravings about the “stolen” US election; Peta Credlin’s false claim that Rudd’s petition for a Murdoch royal commission was an exercise in data-harvesting for which she had to apologise as part of a confidential defamation settlement; Jones’s disinformation about mask-wearing; James Morrow calling the Trump impeachment trial a “sinister plot by Democrats against the American people”.

The second big danger sign is the way Sky News has been able to extend its reach from a niche pay-TV base to free-to-air television via 30 WIN regional stations across Australia and then through social media to the world.

After seeing its audience grow in the first half of 2020 Sky’s pay-TV audience ended the year shrinking. But being on free-to-air TV in regional Australia represents an opportunity for growth.

Data on current regional viewing levels are patchy and incomplete. However prime-time viewing is reported to have grown 36% in 2020 and is claimed to reach 2.9 million unique viewers.

Sky’s non-TV platform is social media. YouTube owned by Google is a very important social media outlet for Sky and that is where the viewer data reported here come from.

Facebook is also an important outlet. When Facebook blacked out Australian news on February 18 there were roughly 260000 views of Sky’s announcement of its last appearance there.

If Facebook persists in its blackout it will clearly damage Sky’s online reach.

The patterns of Sky News viewership on YouTube are revealing.

The big picture is that Sky’s Australian stories get tiny audiences but stories about the United States get vastly bigger ones suggesting Sky has developed a following in the US.

For instance an Alan Jones piece “Trump’s impeachment charge is ‘more Pelosi rubbish’ ” got 130000 views.

And the right-wing US journalist Megyn Kelly’s piece “Trump exposed hidden media bias” got 467926 views.

Read more: Courting the chameleon: how the US election reveals Rupert Murdoch's political colours

Contrast these with Paul Murray’s local story “Daniel Andrews still playing us v them with quarantine”: about 30000 views and Peta Credlin’s “Net zero by 2050 is the ‘economic suicide note for workers’”: about 2000 views.

This tells us Sky is not only playing to a US as well as Australian audience but is tailoring its programming in ways that have worked for Fox News. At the same time it is siphoning into Australia the kind of content that has been so divisive in the US.

The growth profile of Fox News shows Murdoch plays a long game.

Fox News started in 1996. Pew Research Center data show it straight-lined near the bottom of the cable ratings in the US for five years took a jump at about the time of the September 11 attacks another at the time of the Iraq war in 2003 and thereafter cleared away from its main cable news rivals CNN and MSNBC.

Dan Himbrechts/AAP

Until the end of the Trump presidency Fox News was never headed – then after Trump lost it took a dive. In January 2021 it suffered its worst ratings in 20 years coming third behind CNN and MSNBC.

This symbiotic connection between an incumbent government and the Murdoch organisation brings us to the third big danger: the relationship between News Corporation in Australia and the Morrison government.

Morrison is not Trump. Yes he swaggered around in a baseball cap during the 2019 election campaign and yes he talks in slogans and sound bites. However the danger comes not from Morrison’s political persona but from the relationship he and his government have built with News Corporation.

On one reading it has become a commercial relationship between the government as client and News Corporation as provider of publicity services for a fee.

The fee has taken the form of two payments to Foxtel one of A$30 million in 2017 and one of A$10 million in 2020 ostensibly for TV coverage of under-represented women’s sport.

No tender process no publicly available information about the terms no way of knowing how this public money is being spent. Then recent technical glitches in the televising of W League matches prompted the Greens to ask the auditor-general to investigate.

Against these dangers are some mitigating factors.

One is that Australia’s compulsory voting system makes it very difficult for anyone to win an election with a primary vote that is not at least near the 40th percentile. A Trump-like “base” of 32% or so will not cut it here.

A second is that the religious right in Australia does not have the political clout it does in the US. Issues that excite the religious right such as abortion have been long settled here by the courts. The strong vote for marriage equality was another example of the broadly secular nature of our politics.

A third is that the Australian temperament is not on the whole excitable. While this means Australians are often excoriated as apathetic it also means they are not easily outraged.

A fourth is that Australia’s conservatism is of a largely materialistic kind. Franking credits matter. It is also a conservatism that does not like extremism. Morrison seems at last to have realised that outside their Facebook echo chambers the likes of Craig Kelly and George Christensen may be liabilities.

This pragmatic outlook among voters may prove to be a psychological bulwark against the firebrand reactionary politics promoted by Fox and Sky.

Having said that there are plenty of emotion-charged issues that give Sky the opportunity to drive wedges into the Australian body politic: asylum-seekers Muslims Aboriginal recognition African gangs Asians white supremacy the pandemic and above all climate change. Sky is into them all.

If anything concrete is to be done to head off the threat seen by Rudd it is going to involve public policy concerning media accountability of which a fit-and-proper-person test for television licensees would be an essential part.

However every attempt so far to exert meaningful accountability on the Australian media has come to nothing in the face of threats from the big media companies including News Corporation.

Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull as prime ministers were in a position to do something about this. Instead Rudd developed a friendship with the then editor-in-chief of The Australian and Turnbull made changes to the media ownership laws that empowered Murdoch even more.

It is futile to hope that the Morrison government engaged as it is in a highly questionable relationship with News Corporation will do anything about it. As for Labor leader Anthony Albanese when asked about a Murdoch royal commission he reached for the barge pole.

If this form of politics-as-usual persists then Rudd’s prediction cannot be discounted.

Then the nation would be relying on those qualities of the Australian character already mentioned. The question will be whether it will be enough.

Este estuvo marcado por la intervención del consejero de Transformación Económica de la Junta de Andalucía Rogelio Velasco quien lanzó el proyecto de una planta de reciclaje que Atlantic Copper tiene previsto construir en el interior de las instalaciones que se levantan en la capital onubense. En unos momentos donde las nuevas inversiones en el terreno industrial son más apreciables que nunca por la importancia del sector en la recuperación económica como consecuencia de la crisis económica derivada de la pandemia de Covid el anuncio de 262 millones de euros son más que bienvenidos.

La construcción de esta nueva planta tendría un plazo de ejecución aproximado de 24 meses y su puesta en marcha estaría prevista para inicios de 2024. La multinacional Freeport-McMoRan accionista de Atlantic Copper contempla la posibilidad de incluir este proyecto en su Plan de Inversiones de los próximos tres años.

Para el consejero delegado de la compañía Javier Targhetta CirCular es fruto de un largo proceso de innovación que aúna además de la recuperación de elementos de valor a partir de material electrónico eficiencia energética respeto medioambiental y solidez tecnológica aspectos para los que se cuenta con la colaboración de empresas líderes en el mundo de la metalurgia y centros de investigación de primer nivel de ámbito internacional”.

Se trata de uno de los primeros frutos del los planes de simplificación administrativa emprendidos por la Consejería mediante el cual cualquier iniciativa que se considere como estratégica verá agilizados todos sus trámites para que se de un impulso preferente y urgente en la obtención de la documentación necesaria “siempre con la salvaguarda de la seguridad jurídica que se requiere en todos estos procedimientos”.

En este sentido la nueva planta de reciclaje que según confirmaron fuentes de la empresa a Huelva Información se levantará dentro de la superficie que en la actualidad ocupa en la capital onubense “supone la tercera de las actuaciones que se llevan a cabo en la comunidad autónoma después de dos llevadas a cabo en Sevilla y Málaga respectivamente”.

Las cifras adelantadas por el consejero hablan además de la inversión requerida de la “generación de 70 empleos directos a los que hay que añadir otros 280 indirectos e inducidos” con lo que la generación neta de empleo llegará a loas 350 personas.Además “durante la construcción de la propia planta se necesitará la contratación de otras 250 personas con lo que la importancia en la generación de empleo es más que significativa.

En el mismo acto el director de Metalurgia de Atlantic Copper y presidente de la Asociación de Industrias Químicas Básicas y Energéticas (Aiqbe) de Huelva Carlos Ortiz señaló que la inclusión del proyecto como interés estratégico por parte de la Junta de Andalucía “supone un espaldarazo definitivo al mismo y nos permite plasmar de una manera decisiva las inversiones previstas para el mismo”.

La futura planta de reciclaje tendrá una capacidad de tratamiento de 60.000 toneladas anuales de las fracciones metálicas de los residuos de aparatos eléctricos y electrónicos (RAEE) de las que se recuperarán metales no férreos como cobre níquel estaño cinc y de metales preciosos como oro plata paladio y platino. Se ejecutará en dos áreas del recinto portuario onubense: una de las zonas se dedicará a la recepción de materia prima clasificación y toma de muestras y la otra que se destinará a los hornos y sistemas auxiliares se desarrollará en el actual espacio fabril de la compañía.

Según señalaron desde la propia empresa “la declaración de interés estratégico implica el impulso preferente en la tramitación administrativa de los permisos y autorización necesarios para la implantación de proyectos empresariales relevantes con el objetivo de que la inversión no pierda su oportunidad de desarrollarse en Andalucía y no se deslocalice hacia otros entornos”.

Atlantic Copper seguirá poniendo el foco en garantizar la sostenibilidad de sus operaciones. “CirCular será una forma innovadora responsable y eficiente de utilización de recursos naturales ya que complementará la producción de metales de fuentes primarias y que son imprescindibles para la transición energética y la electrificación del mundo en las próximas décadas” subrayó el consejero delegado de la compañía. En este sentido este proyecto metalúrgico evitará la eliminación descontrolada de estos residuos y la correspondiente contaminación causada por ellos.

Desde la empresa señalaron que “conscientes de la importancia de minimizar la huella de carbono los estudios de ingeniería básica apuntan a una reducción de entre el 55% y el 65% de las emisiones de CO2 generado por unidad de cobre equivalente en el reciclado de material electrónico comparado con el generado en toda la cadena de valor añadido de la producción de los metales mencionados más arriba. Adicionalmente el proyecto contempla autoabastecerse el 50% de la electricidad que va a necesitar mediante el aprovechamiento de los calores residuales del proceso.

Mediante CirCular Atlantic Copper “marcará tendencia en Europa y servirá de referente a otras regiones del continente al tratarse de un proyecto que está alineado con los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) y con el Green Deal de la UE y el Plan de Reconstrucción cuyo objetivo es lograr que Europa sea climáticamente neutra de aquí a 2050. El cobre se encuentra entre las materias primas clave que Europa necesitará para alcanzar ese objetivo de una economía sostenible y con un impacto neutral sobre el medio ambiente”.

El proyecto CirCular “forma parte de una de las dos manifestaciones de interés que ha remitido la compañía al Ministerio de Industria Comercio y Turismo (bajo la denominación de CirCular Plus) en el marco del Programa de Impulso de Proyectos Tractores de Competitividad y Sostenibilidad Industrial que tendrá una dotación de unos 12.000 millones de euros gracias a la colaboración público-privada.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Case and equipment – Delicate visuals at the expense of the hardware At a time where watches generally grow larger and larger Garmin is proud to offer its smallest smartwatch so far. A 34-mm (~1.3 in) diameter is indeed very special since Samsung's and Huawei's smartwatches for women so far never achieved sizes of less than 40 mm (~1.6 in). The removable 14-mm watchband will fit wrists between 110 and 175 mm (~4.3 - 6.9 in). In the Classic Edition it is made from leather and in the Sport Edition from silicone. Our test unit is the latter. Instead of mechanical keys there is a sensor key underneath the display which is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. The fact that the sensor key cuts into the bottom of the round display does not stand out in normal usage. To make it apparent we manually adjusted the brightness which is otherwise adjusted automatically. Garmin cuts into the display for the sensor key but hides this well with a pattern overlay on the TFT screen.

Garmin hides the fact that the bottom of the screen is cut off by overlaying the monochrome touch LCD with a discreetly colored pattern. The pattern turns out different for each of the six case colors and remains visible even when the watch is turned off. This means that the surface of the Lily will never turn dark in contrast to all the typical smartwatches with a black display. The sensors of the Lily smartwatch are unspectacular offering little more than measuring heart rate blood oxygen levels and movements. In particular the Lily lacks a GPS and barometric sensor for tracking routes and differences in elevation. NFC also did not fit into the delicate smartwatch.

Setup and Operation – Garmin Lily with a sensor button To connect the watch with an iPhone or Android smartphone you need the Garmin Connect app. You don't need to download the Connect IQ app for the Garmin Store since the Lily does not support the installation of additional apps. In terms of tools the Lily does not offer much beyond a timer stop watch and phone search. Instead Garmin concentrates on good support for fitness and training.

In addition to swiping in order to flip between widgets and the soft key that triggers the back function among other things the operating concept also includes a double tap on the touchscreen. This activates the display when your arm is resting on a table and you don't want to raise it. When in training mode it starts and stops the workout. The widgets include the info screens for heath monitoring coming appointments weather info and notifications and in addition also a remote control for the smartphone player. The Lily signals incoming calls with the caller name if that is stored in the contacts and offers accepting or rejecting the call. If you use the watch in combination with an Android smartphone you can also send a preset SMS saying that you will call back later for example. If you accept the call you then have to use your smartphone to talk.

Health and Fitness – Interval training workouts and rep counters The Lily is obviously a watch for women and in addition to a period tracker it also offers a pregnancy calendar developed by Garmin. Furthermore the Lily offers reminder notifications to move tracks active minutes determines calorie usage records the heart rate and analyzes the stress level. You can also manually record your liquid intake during the day and include the daily analysis in the smartphone app. On the other hand the limited hardware also leaves some gaps. Since the smartwatch does not include a barometric sensor it does not recognize elevation differences and therefore also cannot show the floors climbed which provide a measurement in other fitness trackers for the elevations climbed in addition to the distances covered. There is also no GPS and if the fitness tracker shows a distance at the end of the day Gamin determines an approximation using the step lengths that it has optionally determined beforehand.



Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and Sleep Tracking For manual measurement of the blood oxygen saturation there is a widget that keeps its last measurement in the display. Usually that is the last measurement during sleep since the Lily automatically measures it several times at night also including it in the sleep protocol. Garmin does not record power naps during the day. From the sleep quality or nightly rest Garmin determines a sleep index that is only shown by the app though. Depending on the nightly rest stress level load from the last activity and heart rate variability which is a measurement for the general state of health Garmin then computes the energy reserves which is called Body Battery. This scale serves as an orientation if you are not sure whether your body has recovered sufficiently after your last workout.

Workout and Training For manual recording of your training Garmin offers a total of 13 sport types but only accepts seven of them into the training selection of the smartwatch. While you cannot replace walking and running you can individually configure the remaining five. Since it lacks GPS you have to take your smartphone with you to record your route when biking or running outdoors. On the other hand Garmin's cardio training supports interval training workouts such as HIIT with rep cycles and rest times. During weight training the Lily can optionally count the number of reps and you only have to confirm them at the end of the set. Professional training is also possible in the pool since in contrast to many other sport watches the Lily is also able to measure the heart rate under water. Those who already own a Garmin wearable might already know LiveTrack: Using an invitation link via mail or social network friends can follow your training via a tracking web page in Garmin's portal as long as the smartwatch is also connected to the Internet via the smartphone. Since there is no button for starting pausing or ending the workout a double tap on the display will trigger those functions. In our test this worked at least as well as the usual button on the side to end the training. However after ending the workout in our test the display remained turned off for several seconds before the double tap was able to reactivate it. Another weakness concerns the Bluetooth connection with was dropped occasionally. So in order to be able to use the GPS of the smartphone (Connected GPS) the Lily had to be manually reconnected several times. While this can be done using the actions menu it unnecessarily wastes time. Outdoors the brightness and its automatic adjustment left nothing to be desired.



Battery Life According to Garmin the battery lasts up to five days. However the time is shortened if you activate the automatic Move IQ movement recognition as well as the automatic measurement of the blood oxygen saturation at night. In this scenario and with several interactions per day such as reading health info and notifications the Lily ran for barely two days. Without the automatic movement recognition it was three days when still using it frequently. In the test charging it up to half its capacity took half an hour and for the full capacity an hour and twenty minutes.

Verdict Test unit provided by Garmin With its smartwatch for women Garmin succeeded in creating a good product. The Lily visually stands out from the rest of current smartwatches supports an active and healthy life style and in terms of sports scores with its support of interval trainings that have been in demand for a while.

The patterned colored display and fitness and health functions for women make the Lily stand out. However without GPS the sports watch lacks something essential but those who take their smartphone anyways for listening to music while jogging will hardly miss that. Compared to other similarly priced wearables the hardware equipment is weaker overall. A positive point of the Lily is the SpO2 sensor and Garmin makes the most out of it. The fact that the smartwatch only records the oxygen saturation automatically at night but during the day you have to trigger it manually is a compromise to avoid overly shortening the battery life. Other fitness trackers handle this the same way at best or do even worse.

Price and Availability The recommended retail price of the Lily is 249.99 Euros (~$302; $249 in the US) for the Classic Edition with a leather band and the Sport Edition with a silicone band costs 199.99 Euros (~$242; $199 in the US). Until the end of our test prices remained stable to a large extent. The prices are similar at Amazon and BestBuy.

The start of a new year is often filled with promises to start anew to have a more positive attitude and to do better than you did the year before. It's no wonder then that for many these goals often include getting more active and/or losing weight. So when I had the chance to write this Garmin Index S2 Smart Scale review late last year I fully intended to approach the task with all the gusto of a new year's resolution. But then like most resolutions I sort of dropped the ball.

Luckily after a crazy January I got my second wind and committed to making better health and lifestyle choices. This included measuring and keeping track of things like my weight body mass index (BMI) and other important body metrics. I've used some of the other best smart scales in the past but like most diets I didn't always stick with them. However after just a week or so of using the Garmin Index S2 I think I can finally commit. Not only that but this smart scale might just be enough to pull me from my beloved Fitbits into wearing a Garmin smartwatch on a regular basis!

The Index S2 made its debut in mid-October 2020 at a retail price of $150 which it has maintained as of this review. The S2 replaces the previous Index model which Garmin sold for nearly five years. It added a color display and a few more metrics and customizations. The S2 remains one of the more expensive smart scales on the market in early 2021.

So many metrics!

Garmin Index S2 Smart Scale: What I like

My initial impression of unboxing and setting up the Garmin Index S2 set the tone for the positive experiences that followed. Once I installed the four AA batteries (which were included) and opened the Garmin Connect app it only took a few clicks and a few minutes to get up and running. It was far-and-away faster and easier than when I set up my Fitbit Aria scale a few years ago. With its complicated local Wi-Fi setup process that experience nearly had me return the device but there was none of that frustration with the Index S2.

Image 1 of 5

The other major upgrade for me from the Fitbit to the Garmin Index S2 was just how many modes and metrics the Index S2 could measure. The scale lets you monitor not only your weight and BMI but also your body fat percentage body water percentage skeletal muscle mass bone mass and your weight trends over time. The colorized display is capable of showing you multiple metrics at once as well as the weather (so you know what to wear for the day!).

As an Android nerd I also love that Garmin allows me to customize the metrics that I want to see on the scale's display and in the app summary through the Widgets setting in the device section of the Garmin Connect app. And once you get the display just the way you want it you can pull the data into Google Fit or Apple Health depending on which phones you and your family are using. This makes it an ideal scale for multi-device households. Indeed the Index S2 can register and record data for up to 16 people so chances are your entire family (maybe even your extended family) can get a lot of use out of this device. That kind of functionality definitely helps to justify its higher price tag.

Sticker shock

Garmin Index S2 Smart Scale: What I don't like

Source: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central (Image credit: Source: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)

There's not much negative to say about the Garmin Index S2 in my opinion. It's a well-made device that offers tons of health insights and works flawlessly with the Garmin Connect app and suite of devices. However...

This is a really minor ticky-tack complaint to be sure but the black version of the Index S2 is super fingerprint-y or rather footprint-y. I know that's a cosmetic detail but the simple fact is that you're likely to be barefoot when using this device. Actually you'll need to be barefoot in order to get a holistic view of your health as the scale's sensors can't measure things like body composition when your socks or shoes are on. Plus if you're sharing the device with roommates or family members you're going to be seeing a lot of foot smudges—just something to keep in mind in your (hopefully) pristine bathroom.

While the Index S2 can feed data into platform health data congregation apps like Google Fit and Apple Health it works best within the Garmin Connect app and ecosystem. This means that if you're wearing a Fitbit or Samsung watch you'll still need to install Garmin's app and connect it to that from your phone OS manufacturer rather than having all of your data in one seamless app experience.

If you've done any research into the smart scale market you've probably figured out that you can get a lot of what the Index S2 offers from competitors for significantly less money. How much less and from which competitors? Well I'm glad you asked. Let's take a look at some of the competition.

The competition

Source: Eufy (Image credit: Source: Eufy)

Our current recommended smart scale champ is the Eufy Smart Scale P1. This gadget can track just about as many metrics as the Garmin Index S2 but comes with a much more affordable price. The major downside here is that the scale lacks Wi-Fi connectivity.

Withings is well-known for its medical-grade devices and the Withings Body+ is the perfect home extension of that mindset. It can track a ton of health metrics and even allows you to track pregnancy stats and your baby's weight. It works with Alexa but it's one of the more expensive options on this list. Still it's substantially cheaper than the Garmin Index S2.

While we've been a fan of the Fitbit Aria Air the product is no longer listed on Fitbit's website and it may be hard to find through third-party retailers at this time. It's also a bit older and doesn't have all of the fancy sensors as the Garmin Index S2; it just measures weight and BMI. Nevertheless it integrates seamlessly with the Fitbit app and ecosystem so it's a great choice if that's where you live. In fact I've been using one for the better part of three years now.

Finally I thought it was worth a mention to include one of the latest smart home products from Wyze — the Wyze Scale. As with most Wyze products the Wyze Scale is insanely affordable and measures all kinds of biometric data like body fat % heart rate lean body mass visceral fat and even protein levels. You can pick up a Wyze Scale for around $20-$30.

You are a heavy Fitbit user

Overall I came away extremely impressed with the Garmin Index S2. Even if I don't totally understand all of the metrics it measures I am grateful that they are available. More than that the data presented has me even more interested in continuing my fitness journey because I want to learn more about how things like my skeletal muscle mass bone mass body water percentage have to do with my weight gains and losses. For me it's as much an educational tool as it is a fitness tool.

4.5 out of 5

As great a smart scale as the Index S2 is you can get most (if not all) of its benefits from less expensive devices from Eufy Wyze and Withings — just to name a few. But if the $150 price tag isn't an obstacle for you and particularly if you're already a Garmin fan then you should be very happy adding this device to your home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcm9hZC5jYy9jb250ZW50L2ZlYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8taG93LWdldC1rb21vb3Qtcm91dGVzLXlvdXItZ2FybWluLTI4MTA2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: How to get Komoot routes on your Garmin,"In our last Komoot ‘how-to’ we took a look at getting set up with an account. This time we’re going to show you how to get fully integrated with a compatible Garmin head unit as there are some very nifty features to explore.

If you’re not sure what Komoot is then that’s easy enough: it’s an app that lets you find plan and share adventures with its easy route planner. You can plan routes on your computer or on your smartphone and you can get turn by turn directions on your phone or by syncing a compatible app.

If you're new to Komoot use our road.cc voucher code to get an offline region map bundle for FREE. Head to Komoot and enter the code ROAD*KOMOOT. Valid until 31/12/2021

If you haven’t already joined the Komoot community then we’ve got a great video on the road.cc channel where Becca takes you through the process of signing up and creating your first route. We’ll assume that you’ve done that and you want to follow your routes on a compatible Garmin device like this Edge 1030 that we have here. All you need is your Garmin and your phone. So let’s crack on and get synced up.

Firstly turn your Garmin device on and click on the IQ button in the bottom right hand corner. Komoot may already be installed on your device but let’s assume not. In that case you’ll have to install the app using the Connect and Connect IQ apps on your smartphone.

First off make sure that your Garmin is connected to your phone. If you haven’t done that already then it’s easy to do through the connect app. Once you’ve done that head to the bottom of the menu in the app and select ‘connect to IQ store’. Once you’re in there you can search for the Komoot app. You can see that we didn’t have to it’s in our suggested list. Click on the app and install it.

Once the install is complete click on the IQ button on the main menu of your Garmin and select Komoot. You’ll need to sync your account: the app will give you a code and you need to log into the Komoot website. You can do this on your phone or on your computer. Enter the code and the app on the Garmin will be synced with your Komoot account.

Once you’ve done that you should be good to go. You can see all the tours you’ve got planned. This one’s a loop that we’ve been planning to do. You can see the map and clicking down here gives you the stats and the ride profile as well as the types of road and path you’ll be on and the surfaces you’ll encounter.

Click on ‘Start’ and you can select a Garmin profile for the ride we’ll choose road. Then you get another summary page. You can see all the info from before and there’s also a ‘climbs’ page that gives you a heads up on when the hard work’s going to come. All ready? Time to head outside.

So there you go: that’s how to get your Garmin device synced with Komoot so that you can navigate the great rides you’ve got planned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcGV6Y3ljbGluZ25ld3MuY29tL3JlYWRlcnNyaWdzL3JlYWRlcnMtcmlnLWhhbm5lcy12ZXJ5LXNwZWNpYWwtZHVjYXRpLWJpYW5jaGkv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXpjeWNsaW5nbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3JlYWRlcnNyaWdzL3JlYWRlcnMtcmlnLWhhbm5lcy12ZXJ5LXNwZWNpYWwtZHVjYXRpLWJpYW5jaGkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Readers' Rig: Hannes' Very Special Ducati Bianchi,"Readers’ Rig: Hannes Wessels in Cape Town South Africa has a very unique Bianchi that was rescued from the dustbin repaired and repainted as a tribute to the Ducati Panigale Speciale. A beautiful looking bike with a great story.

Name: Hannes Wessels

Location: Cape Town South Africa

Frame: Bianchi Oltre X2

Group: Campagnolo Record/Super Record

Handlebar/Stem: Zipp

Wheels: Campagnolo Bora One

Pedals: Garmin Vector 3

Saddle: Specialized

Weight: 7.5 kg.

When did you buy it?

I didn’t and that’s what makes the story interesting. The bike was an insurance write off with the frame’s carbon punctured in two places – at the bottom of the down tube and the rear brake calliper (which was completely ripped out of the frame).

What made you choose this bike?

Looking at the frame which my LBS was about to throw away I thought there must be a way to rescue this beautiful machine so I phoned up Cape Town’s carbon repair maestro Anton Cloete who was quick to assure me the frame could be salvaged.

Have you done any modifications/additions to it?

No specific modifications but completely redesigned the paint job to be a tribute to the Ducati Panigale Speciale. (please refer the mock up design in the photo folder reference above).

How many miles/kilometres do you do a year?

Between 7 and 10 thousand.

What do you love about this bike?

The Bianchi Oltre range is well know for its combination of lightness and stiffness.

Favourite riding areas?

Chapmans Peak which is close to where I live. Considered one of the world’s most famous and beautiful roads.

Top riding experience on your bike?

Mostly used as a training bike it descends extremely well.

Future upgrades?

Will consider Super Record 12 speed in future.

Last words:

In a world where recycling is becoming more and more important giving a second life to something that was heading to the garbage dump was very satisfying.

Thanks to Hannes for sharing his ride with us. Got a bike that you just love to stare at? Well how about sharing it with fellow PEZ fans and getting it featured in Readers’ Rigs so we can all stare at it! Send us a Readers’ Rigs submission direct to [email protected] and your bike could be featured in all its glory here on the pages of PEZ.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpY2tyLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvd2hvb3Atb2ZmZXJzLWEtZGF0YS1mb2N1c2VkLXRha2Utb24tZml0bmVzcy1nYWRnZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whoop offers a data-focused take on fitness gadgets – Pickr,"It’s not just the familiar names like Apple Fitbit Garmin and the like as a new name pops up and it’s kind of a big whoop. Kinda. Sorta.

Australians might soon get another fitness wearable to pick offering yet another gadget to track fitness and sleep but with a different approach to data. Essentially it aims to give you more data than most other wearables out there and that makes it very different.

It’s called “Whoop” and it’s a little bit different from your typical wearable. While most of the wearables out there tend to offer the time or something else like payment functionality Whoop appears without any of that. Rather it’s a strap with a lot of tracking and yet also no screen for you to check the time or your progress.

Whoop appears built to track and track alone so you won’t be glancing down at your wrist for the time or even what song you’re playing. Instead you let Whoop do its thing and provide insights into your fitness.

Founded in 2021 by squash player Will Ahmed the concept was built initially for professional and university sports teams before making its way to a consumer product a few years later and insights appear to be the focus.

Throughout activities the Whoop Strap will track movement heart rate respiratory rate recovery information strain sleep tracking and more and send this over to your phone using Bluetooth LE. The strap is waterproof and can use this information to provide an understanding of your fitness through regular insights and a data-filled app.

In fact data is the name of the game here so it’s something you pay for monthly kind of like a gym membership. Whoop told Pickr that it uses a subscription model because “your goals change so your fitness tracker and health monitor changes with you”.

As such it’s not your conventional fitness wearable because it’s not a “buy it once” approach. Rather you spend a little on the wearable and keep spending on the service making it a little more expensive than other wearables though it could potentially offer more insight.

Locally Australians can expect to pay $264 for six months $384 for 12 months or $432 for 18 months with the Whoop tracking band being free but the accessories to make it look your own costing something on top.

That makes it something a little bit new for the wearable world and is partnered with more than a few organisations in America that have to do with sports including the PGA Tour and LPGA Tour for golf Major League Baseball the Premier Lacrosse League and others helping to prove its mettle.

However it may not be for everyone thanks in part to its huge focus on fitness and on data that can improve and optimise behaviour and results. We’re not quite sure what this will look like and are especially intrigued by a fitness wearable going back to the old design of when there were no screens making it unlike practically every other major wearable out there.

Whoop clearly isn’t an Apple Watch a Fitbit or even a Samsung Galaxy Watch and that might just make it one of the more interesting wearables Australia is set to receive. We’ll let you know how we go with a review hopefully in short order."
IT,Gartner,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vY3J5cHRvc2xhdGUuY29tL3doeS1jcnlwdG8tbWlnaHQtZ3Jvdy1saWtlLXRoZS1lYXJseS0yMDAwcy10ZWNoLXN0b2Nrcy1hbi1pbnRyb2R1Y3Rpb24tdG8tdGhlLWdhcnRuZXItaHlwZS1jeWNsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why crypto might grow like the early 2000s tech stocks: An introduction to the Gartner Hype Cycle,"Developed by research company Gartner to represent the adoption of new media hype cycles have been used since the 1990s to quantify and predict the performance of groundbreaking new technologies. With the Gartner Hype Cycle perfectly describing the ups and downs the dot-com boom saw in the early 2000s many have wondered whether applying the methodology to the crypto industry would provide more clarity as to where the market is heading.

Quantifying bold promises from new technologies with the Hype Cycle

Since the early nineties and the beginning of the internet boom each new technology has carried with itself a huge amount of hype. And while publicity has often been one of the most important factors in technology adoption it often clouded the public’s vision of what was actually commercially viable and sustainable in the long term.

To help both investors and the public discern the hype from real value American research and advisory company Gartner came up with its trademarked Hype Cycles—a representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications and their relevance to solving real business problems.

Every Hype Cycle boils down a new technology’s life cycle to five key phases—the innovation trigger the peak of inflated expectations the trough of disillusionment the slope of enlightenment and the plateau of productivity. If applied correctly to new technology or application Hype Cycles can help investors get a better understanding of where the technology stands and evaluate the risks involved with investing in a certain period of time.

But what does an often-disputed metric usually applied to the dot-com bubble in the late nineties have to do with the crypto industry? And how can it be used to quantify the adoption of blockchain a technology that continuously fails to resemble anything we’ve seen in the market so far?

Crypto bull runs show an almost perfect correlation to Gartner’s Hype Cycle

Since the first Bitcoin block was mined in January 2009 the cryptocurrency industry has been on what can only be described as a wild ride. The massive ups and downs cryptocurrency prices have seen in the past decade did little to convince the general public that it was seeing a rise of a new monetary system and not a get-rich-quick Ponzi scheme. The equally fast growth crypto media has seen in the meantime has convinced many that a single article can be as big of a market mover as a major financial recession.

And while the crypto community has been embroiled in a decade-long discussion with the mainstream about the viability of cryptocurrencies blockchain technology has been on a low-profile journey almost all emerging technologies have gone through.

The innovation trigger for blockchain technology was the Bitcoin whitepaper a single event that started a ripple effect of breakthroughs. It led to the creation of other cryptocurrencies and ideas about additional implementation for blockchain. While extremely exciting to the small population involved in the niche technology the first phase of the cycle often produces no usable products and has no proven commercial viability.

This was the case with Bitcoin which remained essentially worthless until 2010 when the first BTC trading platforms emerged from the BitcoinTalk Forum. The following couple of years were market by price volatility and low adoption.

The second phase blockchain encountered was the peak of inflated expectations where early publicity produced a number of success stories accompanied by an almost equally high number of failures. For blockchain the second phase started in 2014 with Ethereum and reached its peak in 2017 with the market mania surrounding ICOs. The period between 2014 and 2017 saw an unprecedented rise in adoption with the retail market being responsible for most of the price hikes.

Ethereum made it cheap and easy for essentially anyone to issue a token. Hundreds of millions and sometimes even billions of dollars were raised overnight with investments flooding in from around the world into projects backed with little more than a website.

However the wild west that was the ICO boom met its end in 2017 when blockchain entered the third phase of the Hype Cycle like clockwork.

The trough of disillusionment Gartner’s third Hype Cycle phase is described as a period of waning interest as new technology experiments and implementation fail to deliver their ambitious promises. According to Gartner this is where producers of the technology or in this case token issuers get shaken out of the market.

Those that survive the shake-up do so only by improving their products “to the satisfaction of early adopters.”

After the speculative crypto bubble exhausted in late 2017 the market was left in shambles as numerous projects failed and billions of dollars in market capitalization was erased. Back in 2018 Gartner’s own analysis identified that the market entered the trough of disillusionment putting blockchain among the rapidly declining technologies such as autonomous driving and IoT platforms.

With almost 80 percent of the market cap wiped out negative sentiment dominated the market spreading disillusionment both among institutions dabbling in cryptocurrencies and retail investors.

After suffering its most devastating hit the market took almost two years to fully recover.

It wasn’t until the rise of DeFi that the industry entered into the fourth phase of the Gartner Hype Cycle—the slope of enlightenment. Essentially the recovery phase it’s the first time instances of how the emerging technology can benefit enterprises start to crystallize. According to Gartner this is where second and third-generation products begin to appear on the market and less risk-averse enterprises begin funding projects and implementing the technology.

Last year’s DeFi boom attracted an unprecedented amount of new users to the market. And for the first time ever it wasn’t just the promise of huge yields that made people flock to the crypto space—third-generation cryptocurrency projects like Cardano Polkadot and Chainlink offered a glimpse of a technologically-advanced future many believe to be achievable and sustainable.

The response to the global COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in controversial fiscal measures such as stimulus packages and quantitative easing seemed to diminish not just the retail sector’s trust in fiat currencies but the institutional reliance on government-issued currencies as well. To diversify their treasuries and create the potential for huge profits several high-profile companies began investing billions of dollars in Bitcoin.

And while many criticized MicroStrategy and Tesla for their “reckless” investments the corporate jump to cryptocurrencies shows that more enterprises began to realize and better understand the benefits of cryptocurrencies—exactly as described in the Gartner Hype Cycle.

More industry voices believe the market is entering into the fifth and final phase of the Hype Cycle

The plateau of productivity—the fifth and final phase of the Hype Cycle where mainstream adoption truly begins to take off. Gartner describes this phase as the period where the criteria for accessing a project’s viability becomes more clearly defined and a technology’s market applicability begins to pay off by becoming globally relevant.

One of the main characteristics of the plateau phase is a significant slow-down of volatility and the adoption of a slower more sustainable growth pace. And while it can be argued whether this could be applied to the crypto industry some of the industry’s most influential voices believe that this is exactly where the crypto market currently is.

Su Zhu the CEO of Three Arrows Capital a Singapore-based hedge fund manager said he believed the market was currently in the last Gartner cycle. The cycle he explained on Twitter won’t be as short-lived as the others and will extend many years into the future bringing over a billion new people into the crypto ecosystem.

This is not yet another cycle this is the End of Cycles The one where after BTC flippens gold it doesn't flip back The one where web3 supercedes web2 Where culture is collected and accrued digitally instead of physically Where life is lived mindfully rather than mindlessly — Su Zhu (@zhusu) February 20 2021

According to Zhu the very fact the market has entered the plateau of productivity means that there was a high probability that we’d never see another major market crash like the ones we’ve seen in March 2020 and in January 2018.

In workplaces machines are also learning to write so effectively that within a few years they may write better than humans. Sometimes they already do as apps like Grammarly demonstrate. Certainly much everyday writing humans now do may soon be done by machines with artificial intelligence (AI).

The predictive text commonly used by phone and email software is a form of AI writing that countless humans use every day. According to an industry research organisation Gartner AI and related technology will automate production of 30 per cent of all content found on the Internet by 2022. Some prose poetry reports newsletters opinion articles reviews slogans and scripts are already being written by artificial intelligence. Literacy increasingly means and includes interacting with and critically evaluating AI.

This means that our children should no longer be taught just formulaic writing. Instead writing education should encompass skills that go beyond the capacities of artificial intelligence.

Back to basics or further away from them?

After 2019 PISA results (Programme for International Student Assessment) showed Australian students sliding backwards in numeracy and literacy then Education Minister Dan Tehan called for schools to go back to basics. But computers already have the basics mastered.

Three major reports — from the NSW Teachers’ Federation the NSW Education Standards Authority and the NSW QLD Victorian and ACT governments — have criticised school writing for having become formulaic to serve NAPLAN (the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy).

In some schools students write essays with sentences fulfilling specified functions in specified orders in specified numbers and arrangements of paragraphs. These can then be marked by computers to demonstrate progress. This template writing is exactly the kind of standardised practice robot writers can do.

Are you scared yet human?

In 2019 the New Yorker magazine did an experiment to see if IT company OpenAI’s natural language generator GPT-2 could write an entire article in the magazine’s distinctive style. This attempt had limited success with the generator making many errors.

But by 2020 GPT-3 the new version of the machine trained on even more data wrote an article for The Guardian newspaper with the headline “A robot wrote this entire article. Are you scared yet human?” This latest much-improved generator has implications for the future of journalism as the Elon Musk-funded OpenAI invests ever more in research and development.

Robots have voice but no soul

Back at school teachers experience pressure to teach writing for student success in narrowly defined writing tests.

But instead the prospect of human obsolescence or “technological unemployment” needs to drive urgent curriculum developments based on what humans are learning AI cannot do — especially in relation to creativity and compassion. AI writing is said to have voice but no soul. Human writers as the New Yorker’s John Seabrook says give “colour personality and emotion to writing by bending the rules”. Students therefore need to learn the rules and be encouraged to break them.

Creativity and co-creativity (with machines) should be fostered. Machines are trained on a finite amount of data to predict and replicate not to innovate in meaningful and deliberate ways.

Purposeful writing

AI cannot yet plan and does not have a purpose. Students need to hone skills in purposeful writing that achieves their communication goals.

Unfortunately the NAPLAN regime has hampered teaching writing as a process that involves planning and editing. This is because it favours time-limited exam-style writing for no audience.

Students need to practise writing in which they are invested that they care about and that they hope will effect change in the world as well as in their genuine known readers. This is what machines cannot do.

AI is not yet as complex as the human brain. Humans detect humour and satire. They know words can have multiple and subtle meanings. Humans are capable of perception and insight; they can make advanced evaluative judgments about good and bad writing. There are calls for humans to become expert in sophisticated forms of writing and in editing writing created by robots as vital future skills.

Robots have no morality

Nor does AI have a moral compass. It does not care. OpenAI’s managers originally refused to release GPT-3 ostensibly because they were concerned about the generator being used to create fake material such as reviews of products or election-related commentary.

AI writing bots have no conscience and may need to be eliminated by humans as with Microsoft’s racist Twitter prototype Tay.

Critical compassionate and nuanced assessment of what AI produces management and monitoring of content and decision-making and empathy with readers are all part of the “writing” roles of a democratic future.

Skills for the future

As early as 2011 the Institute for the Future identified social intelligence (“the ability to connect to others in a deep and direct way”) novel and adaptive thinking cross-cultural competency transdisciplinarity virtual collaboration and a design mindset as essential skills for the future workforce.

In 2017 a report by The Foundation for Young Australians found complex problem-solving skills judgement creativity and social intelligence would be vital for students’ futures.

This is in stark contrast to parroting irrelevant grammar terms such as “subordinate clauses” and “nominalisations” being able to spell “quixotic” and “acaulescent” (words my daughter learnt by rote in primary school recently) or writing to a formula.

Teaching and assessment of writing need to catch up to the real world.

Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways (ANA) confirm that the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau has issued a directive to temporarily suspend the operations of 777s equipped with PW4000s.

The directive affects 31 777-200/300s in the fleets of the two carriers.

“Prior to the directive JAL had temporarily suspended operations of the said aircraft at 14:00 on 21 February as our Boeing 777 aircraft features the same engine as the UA aircraft involved in the incident” says JAL.

“Therefore we were taking the necessary steps to verify if any additional maintenance actions need to be performed on the applicable aircraft.”

On 4 December a JAL 777-200 suffered a significant PW4000 failure involving the loss of a large panel and fan blade damage. The incident occurred as the aircraft JA8978 (MSN 27637) operated flight JL904 from Okinawa’s Naha airport to Tokyo Haneda. The aircraft returned safely to Naha with none of the 178 passengers or 11 crew injured.

In all the directive applies to 13 JAL 777s – nine -200s and four -300s. JAL adds that it has already announced plans to retire this fleet with the -200s to be retired by December 2021 and the -300s by March 2022.

JAL says that 22 777s with GE Aviation power plants – nine -200ERS and 13 -300ERS – are not affected by the directive.

ANA states that 19 of its aircraft are affected by the directive.

“The affected flights were all for our domestic operations within Japan and as they were changed to operate on the 787 and other aircraft no flights have been affected” says ANA.

“Future operations will depend on further notice from Japan’s Civil Aviation Bureau and we will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.”

ANA for its part has previously stated plans to start retiring older 777s.

Korean Air has 16 PW4000 powered 777s – 12 -200s and four -300s – and is operating three of each variant. The airline confirms that it has grounded all of its PW4000-powered 777s.

According to Cirium fleets data Japan and Korea are the only countries in the Asia-Pacific that operate PW4000-powered 777s with a total of 64 examples either in service or in storage. The average age of the fleet is 17.1 years.

On 20 February a United 777-200 operating flight 328 (registration N772UA) from Denver to Honolulu suffered a major failure after taking off shedding debris over a residential area including the engine’s nose cowl that landed feet from a house. The aircraft landed safely and none of the 231 passengers and 10 crew were injured.

Brookfield Mayor Steve Ponto

Ponto’s proclamation says that the month “calls our attention to the need to continue our efforts to build a society that lives up to its democratic ideals” and that Brookfield “aspires to be an inclusive community in which all citizens are respected and recognized for their contributions and potential contributions to our community our state and our country…”

That has some people positively outraged.

Ald. Mike Hallquist released a statement trashing Ponto and the Common Council which chose Ponto’s positive resolution over an earlier version written by students. He called the mayor’s proclamation “deeply inadequate.”

He said the mayor and Council refused to recognize “systemic racism” and “chose to whitewash history and deny the many challenges faced by the Black community in Brookfield & Greater Milwaukee.” He was upset that the proclamation “contained no single recognition of hardship past or present…”

He said that five students crafted the original resolution (the mayor’s proclamation thanked them). Hallquist claimed the mayor and Council want to put a “positive spin on centuries of suffering by the Black community.” Read his statement in full here.

We asked Brookfield Mayor Steve Ponto about the controversy and he sent us this statement:

During the 11 years that I have been Mayor and for the 12 years before when I was an Alderman City of Brookfield proclamations have had a positive tone. If you read the proclamation which Alderman Mike Hallquist and the five high school students wrote it has some positive statements but it also has many negative statements including allegations against the State of Wisconsin and suburban municipalities. I therefore did some research on the internet and wrote a resolution which I believe is very positive in keeping with Brookfield practice. I did not re-write the students’ proclamation but wrote an alternative proclamation. In that proclamation I set a very positive tone; I proclaimed February 2021 as ‘Black History Month’ in the City of Brookfield; and I commended the five students for their interest in government and for the suggestion that the City proclaim February 2021 as ‘Black History Month.’ Both proclamations were considered by the City’s Legislative and Licensing Committee and my proclamation was recommended to the Common Council by a vote of 5 to 0. The Common Council then adopted my proclamation by a vote of 12 to 2. The two negative votes were those of Alderman Mike Hallquist and another Alderman who didn’t want any proclamation on this matter.

What did the students’ proclamation say?

The students’ version was much longer. It also celebrated the achievements of black Americans and discussed the history of the month and the national theme.

But it added statements like this: “Despite all the progress the legacy of slavery and segregation still persist in our nation in forms of mass incarceration the school to prison pipeline racial profiling educational inequalities housing and employment discrimination racism and bias.”

It also stated that “Wisconsin is one of the worst states in the country for racial equality” and it criticizes “financial or governmental regulations by suburban municipalities which resulted in the under-representation of Black families in these communities.”

Hallquist revealed previously that he helped writing it saying “To celebrate and recognize Black History Month Shane Arnold a colleague of mine at GE Healthcare and board member of Mentor Greater Milwaukee and I worked with five truly brilliant students from Brookfield East and Brookfield Central to write this resolution.”

The students involved are Langston Ford and Jose Zapien Guerra from Brookfield East and Cynthia Lu Rayanna Hassan and Jana Gharia from Brookfield Central.

Gharia told Patch: “We wrote and proposed a resolution that was thoroughly researched thought out and detailed. We wrote our resolution based on the facts. The fact that in the history of this country Black Americans have been mistreated misrepresented and discriminated against. They called our resolution ‘negative’ and continuously made comments on the tone of our resolution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc2luZm90ZWNoLmNvbS90b3AtYWktbGFicy1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top AI Labs in India,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a smart-algorithm process which copies bits of human intelligence building it into a dynamic computing environment.

Recent data from Omnicom Media Group and Snap Inc. shows that Covid-19 caused video consumption to increase across apps such as social media (61%) and streaming both in the platforms themselves (56%) and streaming apps on phones (52%). Even when using apps like Facebook Snapchat and Instagram that don’t specialize in videos users are spending more than half their time watching videos of some kind.

They’re conservatively designed and well-built and they offer a few specific design cues that appeal to a specific niche of users. And two models from the range stand out for around $1000: The ThinkPad T480s and ThinkPad X1 Carbon.

We’ve pitted the two against each other in multiple categories taking into account the improvements Lenovo made with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon over last-gen’s model. The T480s received a refresh in 2019 too in the form of the T490. Lenovo has changed its naming scheme since replacing this range with the more appropriately named T14 and T15.

Design

If you place the ThinkPad T480s and X1 Carbon far enough apart you’ll have a hard time telling the difference between them. They both adopt the usual jet-black color scheme with a soft-touch surface and they both sport the usual ThinkPad logo with glowing red “i.” Hold them in your hand with your eyes closed and they’d both dish up the same robust build quality that’s been engineered to meet MIL-STD-810G specifications.

You would eventually notice though that the X1 Carbon is considerably thinner and lighter (0.62 inches and 2.49 pounds) than the T480s (0.72 inches and 2.9 pounds). The latter’s additional heft didn’t add much in terms of advantages either as connectivity was almost identical between the two. The T480s alone has an integrated Ethernet port but they both support Lenovo’s innovative ThinkPad Pro Dock.

Both notebooks also build in the usual ThinkPad keyboard design similar touchpads and the obligatory red TrackPoint nubbin in the center of the keyboard that’s de rigueur for ThinkPad fans. We did find the X1 Carbon’s keyboard to be snappier and more precise and the T480s version to be somewhat stiff.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is thinner lighter and has a snappier keyboard beating out its chunkier sibling in this category.

Performance

Lenovo configured our review units differently so it’s difficult to compare their performance too precisely. The T480s had an 8th-generation Core i7-8550U CPU while the X1 Carbon had a core i5-8250U while both made due with 8GB of RAM and a fast 256GB PCIe SSD.

Unsurprisingly both notebooks performed similarly and in line with other notebooks in the same class. The T480s did hold a slight advantage in our Handbrake benchmark that encodes a 420MB video as H.265. Here the thicker T480s seemed to benefit from some extra cooling as it churned through the encode process in a shorter time than could be explained by the CPU difference alone.

In terms of storage speeds the X1 Carbon’s PCIe SSD performed almost twice as fast as the one inside the T480s. That’s not to say that the latter is slow by any means as both notebooks can access data as quickly as the typical productivity task is going to ask for it.

The performance deal-breaker difference between the two notebooks involves their very dissimilar Full HD displays. Both are 14-inch panels with anti-glare coatings but the similarities end there. The X1 Carbon’s display had better contrast vastly wider color gamut more accurate colors and higher brightness.

Additionally the X1 Carbon is a staple in Lenovo’s lineup while the T480s was a one-off model. The T480s was discontinued as of February 2021 but Lenovo is moving forward with the eighth generation of ThinkPad X1 Carbon machines. The latest model sports up to an Intel i7-10610U 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe SSD. Comparing performance between an eighth-gen and 10th-gen Intel processor isn’t a fair battle making the ThinkPad X1 Carbon really the only option worth considering.

Portability

As we’ve already discussed the X1 Carbon is significantly lighter and thinner than the T480s and it’s going to slip more easily into a backpack for carrying from place to place. That’s not to say that the T480s is thick and heavy — it’s technically a thin and light notebook as well just not quite so much so as the X1 Carbon.

In terms of battery life though the T480s wins out. And that’s odd because they both pack in 57 watt-hours of battery capacity in spite of their differing girths. The X1 Carbon lasted longer in our most demanding web benchmark test but it fell short against the T480s when browsing the web and playing video.

While the T480s isn’t a class leader in its longevity away from a charger it does manage to best the X1 Carbon which may or may not last you a full day’s work on a single charge. That makes your decision a little easier — if you want the thinner and lighter then the X1 Carbon is the victor. But if battery life matters then the T480s wins this category.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon’s svelte frame wins out

Although the X1 Carbon seems to be positioned as the more premium of the two devices the T480s is just as premium a notebook. A relatively mundane configuration of a Core i7-8550U 8GB of RAM a 256GB SSD and a Full HD display comes in at a hefty $1700 retail (on sale for $1360). At the high end the T480s runs $2665 which adds the benefit of a WQHD display and a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU. You can’t find any configuration brand-new in 2021 however.

The latest X1 Carbon starts at only $950 after coupons featuring an i5-10210U 8GB of memory a 256GB SSD and a Full HD display. A tricked out configuration will run just over $2200 after coupons sporting a faster i7-10610U 16GB of RAM a 1TB SSD and a 4K IPS display with Dolby Vision support.

The ThinkPad T480s provides better battery life than the X1 Carbon but that’s about all it has going for it. Given that there’s not a lot of money separating the two and the X1 Carbon’s high-end configuration is even slightly less than the T480s’s we recommend going with the thinner and lighter of the two.

In Call of Duty: WW2 the franchise expands on an idea from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare creating a social space where you can do all your multiplayer business called the Headquarters.

Located on the beaches of Normandy the Headquarters is your hub for hanging out between multiplayer matches. Here’s a handy guide to everything available at the Headquarters from commending other soldiers to playing old Activision arcade games.

The social space

The Headquarters is supposed to be first and foremost a place where you can show off your accomplishments to other players while you form parties create clans and wait for matches to begin. You can interact with other soldiers and “commend” them for their performance.

You’ll also use the Headquarters to open Supply Drops which are awarded as you play through Call of Duty: WW2’s multiplayer modes. Supply Drops mostly give out new social items like calling cards weapons and uniforms that make your character look cool. You’ll show them off in the Headquarters more than anywhere else. Check the bottom right corner of your screen for a list of any Supply Drops you currently have from both multiplayer and Nazi Zombies. Click them on the menu and you can then call the drop right there on the beach where anyone around can watch to see what comes out of your box.

Finally you can wander around the beach to scope out a few leaderboards that will populate with the names and ranks of players currently occupying the space with you. They’re a quick and easy way to see how you stack up to other players in a variety of game modes.

Mail call

The place you’ll visit first and foremost when you arrive at the Headquarters is the mail drop. Items you’ve earned or have been awarded sometimes come through the mail but more than anything it’ll give you the Headquarters’ main currency — Armory Credits. Hit up your mail every three hours to get your “payroll” of 100 credits.

Operations

In the Operations bunker just past the mail drop you’ll find your superior officer Howard. He offers you “Orders” that you can pick up each day and each week. Orders are small-scale challenges that you can complete to earn Supply Drops experience points and Armory Credits. They include things like winning a certain number of matches in a specific game type racking up headshots or pulling down a high number of kills in a single game.

You can take three daily orders and three weekly orders. Once you’ve selected orders they’ll stay with you until you complete them or abandon them but the batches at Operations refresh according to their type. As you complete orders you can select them from the “Orders” tab on your menu and claim the reward without returning to Howard. You do need to stop by to pick up new ones though and it’s worth checking what’s available each day.

Quartermaster

The first place you can spend those Armory Credits is the Quartermaster. She can sell you pieces of “collections” which are groups of cosmetic items. When you get an entire collection you’ll unlock a special rare uniform. You can get pieces of a collection randomly from loot drops or purchase a piece of the collection with your earned credits. Bear in mind though that quite a few collection pieces are pretty expensive. This is probably what you’ll spend most of your premium currency on.

The Quartermaster also offers “Contracts” which are special types of orders that you pay credits to have. Unlike orders contracts come with a timer. They’re the same basic idea though asking you to complete certain tasks in a given period of time. Do it and you’ll earn better rewards than you usually do with orders.

Theater

You’ll start with the Theater when you first sign on to Call of Duty: WW2. It’s where you can get your briefings on things like Divisions and different game types. The Theater also occasionally has fresh videos that developer Sledgehammer Games will add from time to time. It looks like you’ll potentially be able to watch professional Call of Duty: WW2 matches and tournaments from the Theater too.

Firing Range

On the other side of the mail drop from the Theater is the Firing Range. It’s pretty self-explanatory — you can bring any gun you’ve unlocked here and test it. You can also use grenades and other equipment on the field to try it out with an unlimited supply of ammo. Occasionally orders will send you to the Firing Range to complete some tough fun challenges.

Division Prestige

Head around the corner from the mail drop and you’ll see the Overlook. Before you can head there though you can drop by Division Prestige. When you fully level up a single Division (hitting what would be Level 5) you can “Prestige” it. That means you reset the Division to its base level. The trade-off for doing this is increased experience gains for your character. Prestiging a Division is also the only way to unlock its best primary weapon and its specialized Basic Training perk. So while you’ll lose your Division’s cool perks for leveling it up you’ll earn items you can’t otherwise unlock.

The General

When you max out the level on your entire character you can Prestige yourself as well — resetting all your weapon unlocks but gaining some cool social items for your calling card that show off your skills. To do that head past the Division Prestige and you’ll finally be allowed to talk to the General while you stand at the Overlook. Make sure you’re really ready to restart all your progress before you hit that Prestige button though. Once you do you can’t go back. But the upshot is you’ll unlock special items you can’t otherwise get in Call of Duty: WW2 multiplayer and you’ll receive a Prestige Token — which lets you immediately unlock any one item you might love without having to spend all the time unlocking it again.

1v1

From the main multiplayer menu you can pull up all of Call of Duty: WW2‘s team-based game types. But if you head down to the beach you can engage in a different kind of fight. The 1v1 section of the Headquarters lets you challenge other players in a 1-on-1 match as the name suggests. You can see how you stack up against other players thanks to a leaderboard near where you step into the competition.

Gunsmith

In addition to your Divisions and your character you can also level up all your guns. The more experience you earn with a weapon the more attachments you’ll unlock for it allowing you to customize how it handles. When your weapon reaches max level though you can Prestige it by bringing it to the Gunsmith on the beach. Doing so allows you to add your clan tag to the gun and keep track of how many kills you rack up with it. Plus you’ll get experience point bonuses for your character for your efforts.

The Gunsmith will also allow you to customize the paint job on your guns.

Zombies

If you’re bored of the Headquarters and you don’t want to fire up a multiplayer match you can head down into a tunnel on the beach. It’ll take you beneath Operations where you’ll find a guy you can interact with to access the Nazi Zombies game mode. There’s nothing much else to do here but if you don’t feel like going to Nazi Zombies through the menu you can do it here.

The best place to stop by on the beach is the R&R tent. There you can spend Armory Credits to play old Activision games like Pitfall II and Boxing. There are a bunch of games on offer if you’ve got the Armory Credits to purchase them providing a nice change of pace from all the shooting.

Scorestreak Training Range

On the other side of the beach is what looks a bit like a lifeguard tower. This is the Scorestreak Training Range where you can check out each of the game’s unlockable scorestreaks outside of a multiplayer match. When you climb the tower you’ll look down on a battlefield where computer-controlled soldiers square off against each other. You can pull up any scorestreak you want — even ones you haven’t unlocked — and use it on the battlefield to see it in action. It’s a handy place to figure out which streaks are for you as well as get an idea of how you might avoid them when other players use them against you in matches.

Emblem Gallery

Just up the hill from the Scorestreak tower is the Emblem Gallery tent. In Call of Duty: WW2 the card that displays your player name is made up of two parts: The calling card a large animated image and a smaller square emblem. You can choose from premade emblems when you create your card or you can make an emblem of your own with the game’s emblem editor.

Here's Why.,"Here's What You Need to Know: The M2 machine gun is still shooting to this very day.

The M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun is one of the most famous American weapons. Serving since the 1920s the gun has been a favorite of soldiers in practically every conflict since. It remained the same throughout most of the Cold War retaining the iron sights simple pintle mounts and tripods that were designed for it many decades prior.

But as the United States has stepped up its military commitments around the globe and embarked on a program of modernizing its weapons the M2 has also had to change. Since 2003 a myriad of improvements have come out for the M2 machine gun to improve its usability accuracy and reliability. But even with these upgrades will they be enough to keep the M2 in service?

The biggest upgrade to the M2 was the transition to the M2A1 model in the 2000s. The standard model for most purposes was the M2HB an air cooled version with a heavy barrel. Changing the barrel on the M2HB was an involved process that required adjusting the “headspace” (the distance between the bolt face and the cartridge) and the timing of the machine gun for every new barrel.

During sustained fire this was never ideal as the process would always take a significant amount of time but changing barrels is a necessity during sustained fire to avoid overheating. The adjustable headspace and timing were necessary at the time as parts could not be built to the consistent enough tolerances to have a fixed headspace.

However a few decades later quick change barrels were becoming the norm. The German MG34 and MG42 that the M2HB faced in World War II both used quick change barrels that could be swapped extremely rapidly. During the Cold War the Soviets used .50 caliber machine guns (in their own 12.7 x 108 millimeter caliber). The Soviet NSV was lighter than the M2HB and featured a quick change barrel.

Despite innovation elsewhere M2HB’s design was not revised to incorporate these new features. The same design tripods and mounts continued serving up until the 2000s. At that point the U.S. military held a competition to develop a quick change barrel kit for existing M2s. General Dynamics won the competition for the kit and it was adopted as the M2A1.

While the primary change was the addition of a quick change barrel kit the M2A1 also added a four-pronged flash hider to the barrel reducing the flash of firing which especially improves the ability to shoot at night with the weapon as it makes it less prone to washing out NVGs. The barrel extension is also made of a harder steel.

The Army has replaced all of its M2HBs with M2A1s and the Marines are looking to do the same. A similar setup is being offered as a whole new machine gun as the M2HB QCB by FN Herstal. Some countries have adopted it under that name.

Another upgrade that’s common recently is the attachment of optical sights to the M2. While Carlos Hathcock famously made an optic mount for a M2HB during his service in Vietnam optic mounts were not standardized until much later. In comparison the Soviet NSV came with a standard optic rail which was commonly used with a 4x to 6x sight.

But nowadays there is a lot of interest for optic mounts for the M2. The Korean company DI Optical is one of the leaders in this space producing red dots for the M2HB that have seen use with foreign militaries. Trijicon who makes the ACOG which has seen wide use also makes a machine gun red dot.

The tripod has also seen improvements. The old M3 tripod of World War II vintage is on the way out in the U.S. Army being replaced by the new M205 lightweight tripod. The new tripod is sixteen pounds lighter and has increased traverse and depression range relative to the old tripod.

During your campaign you promised to ""follow the science."" Well now's your chance. The recommendations for added sugar in the 2020-2025 USDA dietary guidelines -- released under the Trump administration -- follow the sugar industry the processed food industry and the money. These recommendations fly in the face of science and will continue to cause significant harm to American children and adults with unfortunate health and financial ramifications for years to come.

It is in the best interest of Americans that you amend this decision by reducing the USDA guideline's added sugar quota to less than 6% of total calories from its current level of 10% and give Americans a fighting chance at health. Reducing sugar consumption is essential to improving the health and productivity of all Americans.

In an 835-page report written by a team of academic medical doctors PhDs and RDs on the USDA's dietary guidelines advisory committee the team explicitly stated that given ""the scientific evidence ... the Committee suggests that less than 6% of energy from added sugars is more consistent with a dietary pattern that is nutritionally adequate.""

The USDA ignored this recommendation. Instead the USDA is keeping the added sugar recommendation at the previous level of 10% because ""the new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for added sugars or alcohol."" This message was conveyed by Mr. Brandon Lipps Undersecretary for Food Nutrition and Consumer Services to the Wall Street Journal.

Note: Mr. Lipps is a lawyer not a medical professional. Let's not ignore the fact that in the five years that the previous guidelines have been in place (2015-2020) diabetes increased in the U.S. population from 30 million to 34 million Americans.

The suggested 4% drop in total calories from added sugar (from 10% to 6%) might not seem like a lot but it represents 20 grams of sugar per person per day which adds up to roughly 2400000000000 -- that's two trillion four hundred billion -- extra grams of sugar per year consumed in the U.S.

Let's be clear: the human body does not need a single gram of added sugar to survive.

American bodies and the U.S. healthcare system are literally crumbling under the weight of added sugar in American diets. COVID-19 has been shown to be significantly more lethal in individuals with high blood sugar and diabetes and obesity are key drivers of mortality.

This fact however did not stop President Trump from increasing sugar imports in April 2020 due to increased 'demand' during coronavirus. Nearly three-quarters of Americans are overweight or obese conditions directly related to sugar consumption. Some 128 million Americans are diabetic or prediabetic and 90% of those with prediabetes don't know they have it. Nine of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. are a result of or made worse by poor blood sugar. Children are developing increasing rates of fatty liver disease and chronic liver dysfunction -- up 62% in the past 10 years.

These are results of too much refined sugar in the diet particularly fructose which in the form of high fructose corn syrup is subsidized by Congress to the tune of nearly $500 billion. Diets high in sugar or blood sugar dysregulation are associated with mental illness reduced cognition and learning heart disease Alzheimer's disease ADHD and suicide. The development of high blood sugar is largely preventable with healthy living and contributes to an astronomically diverse degree of human and economic suffering.

We are a country that aggressively subsidizes disease-promoting foods has weak regulations on the marketing of unhealthy foods to children (unlike many other western countries) and serves nutritionally unsound foods in schools -- which exceed the daily recommendations for added sugars -- and hospitals and then asks taxpayers to cover the costly bill for the health ramifications. Promoting guidelines that if followed will put more money in the pockets of the refined food industry and impair the wellbeing lifespan and livelihoods of American people adds insult to injury.

The food companies on the 2020 Fortune 500 list are universally sugar-slingers: PepsiCo Coca-Cola General Mills Kellogg Hershey McDonalds J.M. Smucker TreeHouse Foods. None of them stand to benefit from guidelines that reduce sugar and many of them are highly politically active in trying to promote their message of sugar being innocuous.

The economic consequences of guiding Americans to eat more sugar are dire. People with diabetes may have 44% less productivity at work. Individuals with diabetes incur more than $16000 of healthcare costs per year 2.3 times more than someone without diabetes. America spends $327 billion on diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. and $147 billion on direct costs of obesity (data from the CDC that hasn't been updated in 12 years). However the real price tag is much higher given that high blood sugar drives Alzheimer's dementia cancer stroke heart disease infertility erectile dysfunction chronic kidney and liver disease preventable blindness and more.

This is also a social justice issue. Minorities and the poor disproportionately suffer from blood sugar-related diseases and are most reliant on school lunches and nutrition assistance programs like SNAP which are influenced by USDA guidelines. Lax USDA nutritional guidelines will lead to more sugar on the plates and in the cups of the exact people who need the most health support and will widen health and economic disparities even more.

It is clearly time that we right this ship follow the science and encourage Americans to eat less added sugar. The payoff would be monumental in saved healthcare costs and increased productivity and could even improve the resilience of all Americans in the face of a pandemic that targets people with high blood sugar.

Though many former General Motors employees in Anderson credit the United Auto Workers with securing their economic advancement some recalled how the union also failed to treat members equally.

Lovel Wilkerson 80 who worked 40 years at GM before retiring in 2002 like most others started out as a janitor but hoped to work his way into production jobs that usually were reserved for white workers.

“There was great partiality in the plant because most of the people in union positions were white” he said.

Anderson resident Clarence Swain said Black workers initially were not allowed to participate in festivities at the union hall even if they were paying union dues.

“The janitorial union had to put pressure on the Anderson union hall to open up to its members” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wMi8yMC93aHktbm9ib2R5LXdpbGwta2lsbC10aGUtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXRoaXMtdGltZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Nobody Will Kill The Electric Car This Time,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2021/02/20/why-nobody-will-kill-the-electric-car-this-time/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wMi8yMC93aHktbm9ib2R5LXdpbGwta2lsbC10aGUtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXRoaXMtdGltZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIxLzAyLzE5NzYyMzEyL2VsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtcmVnaXN0cmF0aW9ucy1yZWFjaC1uZXctcmVjb3JkLWluLXVzLXdpdGgtdGVzbGEtZ20tbGVhZGluZy13YXnSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMTk3NjIzMTI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric Vehicle Registrations Reach New Record in US With Tesla GM Leading Way - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),"Electric vehicle registrations in the US in 2020 reached a record market share of 1.8% demonstrating increased consumer interest for electric vehicles.

What Happened: That's according to a study by IHS Markit Ltd IHS released on Friday.

The report also says that December 2020 had the highest monthly share for new EV registrations at 2.5%.

While roughly 1 in 40 registrations may seem like a drop of the bucket it's the highest seen since IHS started tracking new vehicle registrations by fuel type.

IHS market defined an EV as an automobile powered solely by electricity. No other power source counted toward the EV registration market-share tally.

Why It Matters: Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc TSLA stands to benefit from increased registrations.

According to a report by Automotive News Tesla took four out of the top five spots for new EV registrations in 2020. Tesla accounted for 79% of the total with 200561 EVs registered. That represents a 16% increase from 2019 which saw 172438 Tesla vehicles registered.

The Model 3 and Model Y led the way with 95135 and 71344 vehicles registered respectively.

General Motors Company GM was the only company besides Tesla to crack the top 5 for US EV registrations in 2020. Its Chevy Bolt compact had 19664 registrations in 2020.

Rounding out the top five for 2020 was Tesla's Model X with 19652 registrations and Model S with 14430.

IHS Markit forecasts EV sales in 2021 will surpass 3.5% nationally.

Many of these innovations are aimed at providing greater comfort and convenience – car keys for example have been replaced with key fobs with hands-free/push-button start. The question is will General Motors move to introduce face biometrics as the new standard method for vehicle ingress?

Let’s start with a quick background. The current industry standard for vehicle ingress is the key fob which pairs with hands-free/push-button starters as a replacement for traditional car keys. Now however General Motors is launching a new feature that replaces the key fob with a user’s smartphone such as with the all-new 2022 GMC Hummer EV. As GM Authority covered previously the new Hummer EV allows iOS and Android users to turn their smart device into a “digital key” allowing users to open the vehicle doors and start the EV using only their phones.

Now it’s looking like face biometrics could be the next evolution. As GM Authority exclusively covered General Motors has filed to trademark “Modus Biometric System” in the U.S. and Mexico suggesting the automaker will bring the same facial recognition software already offered in China over to North America.

For those who may not know General Motors currently offers the 2021 Cadillac XT4 luxury crossover in China with a face ID system that leverages a high-definition binocular infrared camera adaptive supplemental lighting a touchscreen and a fingerprint reader to make it easier and more secure for a user to enter their vehicle. The system will scan a user’s face and unlock the doors if the system recognizes the user while offering a fingerprint scan and password function as well.

Which begs the question – will General Motors replace car keys with face biometrics?

The king of eSwatini formerly known as Swaziland has said he recovered from COVID-19 and thanked Taiwan’s president for sending antiviral medication to help him.

The small southern African country an absolute monarchy is Taiwan’s only remaining diplomatic ally on the continent and Taipei has provided large amounts of economic and other aid.

In a speech on Friday King Mswati III said while the country awaited the arrival of vaccines there was an antiviral drug which he did not name that could be used to treat the illness.

He said he had tested positive “for a couple of days” in the first week of January but was now negative.

“I am grateful to the president of the Republic of China on Taiwan for sending through this medication to treat me” he said using the island’s formal name in the speech posted on the eSwatini government’s official Twitter account.

The 52-year-old king had not previously reported his coronavirus infection. He said the drug which was administered through a drip had allowed him to recover before he even had time to announce his hospitalisation.

Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said that upon hearing the king was infected Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen arranged medical assistance for him.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is gratified to hear of the eSwatini king’s successful recovery under the joint care of Taiwanese and eSwatini medical staff” she said.

The king could have been referring to Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral drug remdesivir which was conditionally approved in Europe in July for treating COVID-19 in adults and adolescents with pneumonia requiring oxygen support.

Taiwan also provisionally approved its use last year.

Using the slogan “Taiwan can help” the government has been keen to showcase its assistance to other countries during the pandemic donating face masks and other supplies.

The kingdom of eSwatini has recorded almost 17000 coronavirus infections and 644 related deaths.

Its Prime Minister Ambrose Dlamini died in December after four weeks of treatment for COVID-19 in neighbouring South Africa.

How an East Bay biotech is applying its cancer know-how to a next-generation Covid vaccine

By Ron Leuty

As potentially dangerous variants of Covid-19 emerge globally — including one mutant that infiltrated a Kaiser Permanente emergency room in San Jose late last year — an East Bay biotech outlined plans Tuesday for an experimental next-generation coronavirus vaccine meant to tackle novel forms of the virus.

Gritstone Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: GRTS) of Emeryville said it will work with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on a two-stage Phase I clinical trial of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that will begin later this quarter. That vaccine would not only knock down the “spike” protein that allows the virus to enter cells but also stimulate a part of the immune system to provide a second layer of defense.

BEIJING Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) or the yuan has retained its spot as the fifth most attractive currency for global payments by value in January but with a larger share as a global payment currency said the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) a global provider of financial messaging services.

In January the RMB's share in global payment accounted for 2.42 percent up from the 2.15-percent share in the same period in 2019 showed a monthly report published by the SWIFT.

Value of RMB payments increased by 21.34 percent last month compared with that of December 2020 while in general all payments currencies decreased by 5.86 percent the report added.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the largest market for offshore RMB transactions taking up 75.93 percent followed by the economies of the United Kingdom Singapore and the United States according to the report. ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZWFzdGFzaWFmb3J1bS5vcmcvMjAyMS8wMi8yMS9iaWRlbnMtYnJpZWYtd2luZG93LXRvLWZpeC10aGUtd29ybGRzLWJyb2tlbi1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden’s brief window to fix the world’s broken institutions,"Instead of working to fix flaws in the World Trade Organization (WTO) the World Health Organization (WHO) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other institutions Trump either ignored the problem attacked the institution or withdrew from the institution altogether. He recklessly surrendered one of the most powerful weapons in the US arsenal: the ability to lead in writing global rules and shape global institutions.

Re-writing global rules and reforming the world’s institutions isn’t easy. Past reforms have been painstakingly difficult. Historically successful reforms have required at least three things: leadership from the President of the United States approval from the US Congress (at least when funding is required) and a quorum of major countries that support the change. For the first time in more than a decade all three pieces of the puzzle could be in place.

The Democrats’ dual January Senate wins in Georgia mean they now control both houses of Congress and the White House. President Joe Biden understands that much of US power has come from the institutions and rules it created to cement US interests and influence. Want to trade or invest internationally? You’ll need US dollars for that. Want to access the global payments system? Then don’t upset the United States. Need an IMF bailout or a World Bank loan? Only the United States has veto power.

But these institutions have not aged well and US influence has suffered as a result. Past reforms have helped but more is required. The WTO is a relic of the past. The global trading rules need to be updated to cover subsidies state-owned enterprises forced technology transfer and the digital economy. These issues have fuelled tensions and trade wars.

The IMF is little better. Its quota formula — which gives too many votes and funding responsibilities to Europe and too little to Asia — should be updated to reflect the modern economy along with its Executive Board. Without reform the IMF’s legitimacy and funding suffers; forcing it to be a minority lender in major bailouts while relying on temporary loans (which progressively expire from 2023 to 2025) for half its funding.

The WHO’s budget is smaller than the budget of most big hospitals. The share of unearmarked funding is low with membership dues representing less than 20 per cent of the agency’s total budget. The WHO’s mandate is too broad and its governance structure is too narrow — excluding voices from civil society — while its technical expertise is too limited in areas ancillary but critical to effective health responses: logistics urban design economics law and information technology.

Many more global institutions need reform. Like the IMF the World Bank’s governance needs to reflect the global reality. The out-of-date-membership of the International Energy Agency means that the body which is meant to represent energy consuming countries now excludes a majority of the world’s energy consumers.

The consequences of these out-of-date institutions are the same: more fragmentation and less US influence. As the funding legitimacy and effectiveness of these institutions dwindle regional competitors emerge. For the WTO it’s a plethora of plurilateral and bilateral trade agreements. For the IMF it’s the European Stability Mechanism the Chiang Mai Initiative and hundreds of bilateral currency swap lines. For the World Bank it’s the Asian Development Bank the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and bilateral agencies among others.

Fragmentation makes the global system less effective. Most global regional and bilateral trade agreements are incompatible with each other and create a nightmare for businesses to navigate. Responses to financial crises are now slower more cumbersome and more political. Responses to health crises development challenges and energy transitions are less effective and less coordinated.

As US-dominated institutions fade into the background so does US influence. But for the first time in more than 10 years Biden has a window of opportunity to fix this. Holding the White House and both houses of Congress the United States can lead reform in these institutions and create new rules where there are none today: from tax trade and climate change to competition policy data and the digital economy.

Countries overwhelmingly support change especially in Asia. Indonesia will host the G20 next year and has been a stalwart leader on the case for WTO reform. Asia’s bitter memories of the IMF’s past failings have seen them spend decades calling for reform. A region desperate for investment will benefit substantially from reformed and better coordinated development banks while climate change is an opportunity for constructive engagement on a common priority between the United States China and the Asian region.

Indonesia’s G20 host year in 2022 is an opportunity to get this done. If history is anything to go by Biden will lose the House of Representatives the Senate or both in the November 2022 US mid-term elections. He has no time to wait.

The law is already in force.

Comments

According to the PNPSA those who benefit from environmental services such as water supply oxygen production stability of climatic conditions among others must pay for them through a voluntary transaction. On the other hand those who provide such services must be rewarded for their contribution.

The policy focuses on maintenance recovery and improvement of vegetation coverage in priority areas for conservation and seeks to combat habitat fragmentation and encourage the formation of ecological corridors.

The payment can be made through different modalities among them direct payment (monetary or nonmonetary) the provision of social improvements to rural and urban communities; and the Rural Environmental Quota and sale of green bonds which opens space for the monetization of preserved areas and encourages the voluntary carbon market.

In addition the PNPSA brings provisions that affect the collection of taxes and institute incentives for environmental protection which can become a great opportunity and a relevant instrument for controlling the negative effects of climate change.

More detail

Any person that uses ecosystem services such as public authorities civil society organizations or private agents individuals or legal entities whether national or international will be considered a “payer.” The “providers” on the other hand would be those — private individuals or legal entity established under public or private law or even a family or community groups — that through their actions maintain recover or improve the environmental conditions of ecosystems. In this sense the law prioritizes aid to small producers indigenous and quilombola tribes and traditional communities in the conservation of native vegetation areas.

In these terms the policy seeks to recognize individual or collective initiatives that favor the maintenance recovery or improvement of ecosystem services through monetary or nonmonetary retribution service provision or other form of reward such as the supply of products or equipment.

Maintenance recovery or improvement actions may be carried out in areas covered with native vegetation and/or subject to ecosystem restoration in integral protection conservation units wild areas of sustainable use conservation units quilombola and indigenous lands and areas of conservation exclusion of fishing.

The regulation of the policy will define the essential clauses for each type of payment agreement to be executed for environmental services.

In addition the PNPSA’s institution strengthens the Floresta+ Program which aims to encourage conservation of native forest and creates a market for environmental services a model in which a payer remunerates those that perform effective and lasting actions to maintain the native vegetation in Brazil.

Facebook Would Rather Ban News in Australia Than Pay for it

Facebook has barred Australians from finding or sharing news on its platform in response to an Australian government proposal to require social media networks to pay journalism organizations for their content. The move is already reducing online readership of Australian news sites.

Similar to what happened when Facebook suspended Donald Trump’s account in January the fight with Australia is again raising debate around social media networks’ enormous control over people’s access to information. Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison says his country “will not be intimidated” by an American tech company.

My research in the history of international media politics has shown that a handful of rich countries have long exerted undue influence over how the rest of the world gets its news.

Facebook has 2.26 billion users and most of them live outside of the United States according to the company. India Indonesia Brazil Mexico and the Philippines are home to the most Facebook users outside the U.S.

Facebook’s share of the global social media market is staggering but the company is not alone. Eight of the world’s 11 most popular social media companies are based in the U.S.. These include YouTube and Tumblr as well as Instagram which is owned by Facebook.

The geographic concentration of information technology puts these billions of non-American social media users and their government officials in a subservient position.

The business decisions of Big Tech can effectively dictate free speech around the world.

Imperial origins of international news

Reliance on foreign media has long been a problem in the Global South—so-called developing countries with a shared history of colonial rule.

It began in many ways 150 years ago with the development of wire services — the news wholesalers that send correspondents around the world to deliver stories via wire feed to subscribers. Each service chronicled news in its home country’s respective colonies or spheres of influence so Britain’s Reuters would file stories from Bombay and Cape Town for example and France’s Havas from Algiers.

The Associated Press based in the U.S. became a force in the global news business in the early 20th century.

These companies cornered the global market for news production generating most of the content that people worldwide read in the international section of any newspaper. This meant for example that a Bolivian reading about events in neighboring Peru would typically receive the news from a U.S. or French correspondent.

The news monopolies of former colonial powers continued into the 20th century. Some Latin American countries such as Argentina and Mexico developed their own strong newspapers that reported on local and national events but they could not afford to send many correspondents abroad.

In the 1970s North Atlantic wire services still provided as much as 75% of international news printed and broadcast in Latin America according to my research.

Cold War problems

Separately many world leaders outside of the U.S. and Europe also worried that those foreign powers would intervene in their countries’ domestic affairs by covertly using their countries’ media.

That happened during the Cold War. In the lead-up to a 1954 CIA-supported coup in Guatemala the agency secretly used the Guatemalan radio waves and planted local news stories to convince the Guatemalan military and public that the overthrow of their democratically elected president was inevitable.

After Guatemala in the late 1950s and early 1960s many leaders in the “third world”—countries that aligned with neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union—began creating news and radio services of their own.

Cuban leader Fidel Castro established a state-run international news service Prensa Latina to allow Latin Americans “to know the truth and not be victims of lies.” He also created Radio Havana Cuba which broadcast revolutionary programming across the Americas including in the U.S. South. These were government agencies not independent news organizations.

Global South leaders also wanted to shape the international portrayal of their countries. North Atlantic news services often depicted the third world as backward and chaotic justifying the need for outside intervention.

This tendency was so common that it earned the moniker “coups and earthquakes” journalism.

Taking control

Global South leaders also lacked full access to communications technology especially satellites which were controlled by the U.S. and Soviet-dominated organizations.

In the 1970s Global South leaders took their concerns about information inequities to UNESCO lobbying for binding United Nations regulations that would prohibit direct foreign broadcasts by satellite. It was a quixotic quest to persuade dominant powers to relinquish their control over communications technology and they didn’t get far.

But those decades-old proposals recognized the imbalances in global information that remain in place today.

In recent decades other countries have created their own news networks with the express aim of challenging biased representations of their regions.

One result is Al Jazeera created in 1996 by the Qatari emir to challenge U.S. and British depictions of the Middle East.

Another is TeleSur founded by Venezuela in partnership with other Latin American nations in 2005 which aims to counterbalance U.S. influence in the region. It was created after the 2002 coup attempt against Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez which was supported by the U.S. government and powerful Venezuelan broadcasters.

Why media matters

State-sponsored media outlets have faced accusations—some well-founded—of coverage biased in favor of their government sponsors. But their existence nonetheless underscores that it matters where media is produced and by whom.

Research suggests this concern extends to social media. Facebook and Google for example produce algorithms and policies that reflect the ideas of their creators — who are primarily white male and based in Silicon Valley California.

One study found that this can result in racist or sexist search engine search results. A 2016 ProPublica investigation also discovered that Facebook allowed advertisers for housing to target users based on race violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

All of this raises doubts about whether Facebook or any international company can make rules regulating speech that are equally appropriate in every country they operate in. Deep knowledge of national politics and culture is necessary to understand which accounts are dangerous enough to suspend for example and what comprises misinformation.

Facing such criticism in 2020 Facebook assembled an independent oversight board colloquially referred to as its Supreme Court. Comprising media and legal experts from all over the world the board has a truly diverse membership. But its mandate is to uphold a “constitution” designed by the American company by evaluating a handful of appeals to Facebook’s content removal decisions.

Facebook’s current fight with Australia suggests that equitable control of international news remains very much a work in progress.

LONDON — Global dividends fell sharply in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic with the amount of investor payouts declining 12.2% to $1.26 trillion according to new research. As the international public health crisis spread throughout the world prompting lockdowns and curtailing business activity dividend cuts and cancellations totaled $220 billion between the second and fourth quarters of 2020 according to the latest Global Dividend Index from asset manager Janus Henderson. Still the total amount of dividends paid out between April and December 2020 was $965.2 billion noted Janus Henderson which analyzes dividends paid by the 1200 largest firms by market capitalization before the start of each year. Dividend cuts were most severe in the U.K. and Europe the index found with both together accounting for more than half the total reduction in payouts globally ""mainly owing to the forced curtailment on banking dividends by regulators"" Janus Henderson found.

U.S. resilient

However dividend payouts were resilient in the U.S. rising 2.6% on a headline basis in 2020. ""North America did so well mainly because companies were able to conserve cash and protect their dividends by suspending or reducing share buybacks instead and because regulators were more lenient with the banks"" the report found. Elsewhere globally Australia was badly affected but China Hong Kong and Switzerland joined Canada among the best performing nations. The decline of total dividends in 2020 to $1.26 billion was just slightly less than Janus Henderson's best-case forecast of $1.21 trillion thanks to a less severe fall in fourth-quarter payouts than anticipated. Fourth-quarter payouts fell 14% on an underlying basis to a total of $269.1 billion.

The decline was less severe than expected Janus Henderson noted due to some companies (they cited Sberbank in Russia and Volkswagen in Germany) restoring suspended dividends at full strength while others like Essilor in France brought them back at a reduced level. ""One company in eight cancelled its payout altogether and one in five made a cut but two thirds increased their dividends or held them steady"" it said. On a sectoral basis banks accounted for one third of global dividend reductions by value with almost $54 million dividends cut and $34 million canceled within the industry more than three times as much as oil producers — the next most severely affected sector — which saw just over $24 million payouts cut and canceled. Banks in the U.K. and euro zone have been subject to temporary bans on shareholder payouts since last March amid concerns that banks could run low on capital as the coronavirus crisis took hold. However the Bank of England said in December that banks can resume limited dividends; British bank Barclays announced last Thursday that it would resume dividend payments to shareholders. The European Central Bank's supervisory board which overseas banks in the region also asked regional lenders last March to avoid paying cash dividends to shareholders with the recommendation due to last until September 2021. Jane Shoemake investment director for global equity income at the asset manager noted that the pandemic's ""impact on dividends has been consistent with a conventional if severe recession."" ""Sectors that depend on discretionary spending have been more severely impacted while defensive sectors have continued to make payments. At a country level places like the UK Australia and parts of Europe suffered a greater decline because some companies had arguably been overdistributing before the crisis and because of regulatory interventions in the banking sector.""

It's not like football where two games can completely take you out of contention and it's not like basketball where you can fluctuate wildly from poll to poll. Baseball is a grind and Texas Tech baseball is just beginning the 2021 season.

On Saturday night the Red Raiders got a great start from transfer Patrick Monteverde but ultimately lost to Arkansas 13-9. On Sunday afternoon the Red Raiders left the bases loaded in the top of the ninth against Ole Miss losing 5-4.

In both games the Red Raiders gave up too many free passes and had several errors that ended up costing them two games against top ten teams that they had solid chances to beat. The good news again is that this is a long season and the Red Raiders will have several months of action coming up culminating in the NCAA tournament. The future starts Monday morning February 21st against Mississippi State.

More than just excellent competition the Red Raiders got to experience a major league stadium and atmosphere in Arlington this weekend. The announced attendance on Saturday was more than 16000 and the Sunday game between Texas Tech and Arkansas felt like a weekend game in Omaha. All three decks had fans socially distanced between rows and all six fan bases involved this weekend combined for a magnificent crowd.

During the Red Raider games there were raucous RAIDER POWER chants and things felt normal for the first time in nearly a year. Sure there were masks and ticketless entrance and other small changes from the past but for the first time for me at least a mostly full stadium came together and cheered for high-level athletes.

Win or lose it was a step in the right direction.

On a Texas Rangers note Globe Life Field was awesome. Coming off the worst winter weather the state of Texas has ever seen the roof was closed and it was a balmy 72 degrees inside. The brutal dog days of summer will never be a problem again for the Rangers. The features and pro shop were top of the line and the beer was cold. The turf looked like real grass and the dirt was meticulous. There were also double the staff as normal picking up trash and making sure everything was clean.

Pregame Notes

Arkansas is the designated home team against Texas meaning it will be in the field first and hit last.

B-4th: Arkansas 1 Texas 0

After going 11 up 11 down Arkansas put together a two-out rally in the fourth. Cullen Smith started it with a single and then Braydon Webb walked. That set up an RBI single by Brady Slavens.

B-6th: Arkansas 4 Texas 0

Slavens did more two-out damage in the sixth crushing a three-run home run to right-center. It's the Razorbacks' first homer of the season.

FINAL: Arkansas 4 Texas 0

We sure have missed you Diamond Dawgs. There’s nothing like the smell of grills at The Dude the roar of the crowd after a homer the midweek stress reliever the Southeastern Conference series on the weekends... the list goes on and on.

I hope this 2021 college baseball opening day finds you well as your Mississippi State Diamond Dawgs take the field at 11 a.m. CT at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas.

A few of the teams playing in this weekend’s College Baseball Showdown got together and answered some questions regarding the tournament.

For the last several years the Big 12 and the SEC have vied for College Baseball Conference bragging rights during the regular season. How important are these “challenge” tournaments both from a competition standpoint and for fans?

Frogs O’ War: TCU might be ranked in the top ten but they are still kind of an unknown when it comes to the season ahead. With so many young players expected to play a significant role and a bunch of players who have only a handful of Division I games under their belt facing off against a field like this will certainly be a measuring stick and a wake up call for those who have never been through the grind of a Big 12 season. I think it will be critical for the pitching staff especially — it’s a luxury to put guys in a pressure cooker like this right off the bat and see who has a taste for the bright lights. I think it’s equally as exciting for fans too who got robbed of conference play after such a promising start to last season. To open the 2021 campaign at a Big League ballpark in front of 15000 (hopefully mask-wearing) fans with nothing but top ten teams in the field? What more can you ask for in college baseball? Or even college sports in general?

For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: I would classify this tournament as a “Setting the Stage” type of tournament. Unlike many first game tournaments this trip will require all cylinders to be hitting due to the competition. These “challenge” tournaments are definitely more important for fans and bragging rights more so than the players. The players will have time to reboot if this tournament doesn’t go exactly the way they want. It’ll take more time and more wins for fans (at least Mississippi State baseball fans) to get back on their feet.

Red Cup Rebellion: These early season tournaments in my opinion are to battle test rosters early and to give the coaching staffs an idea of what kind of identity and/or mindset their team has. Is this a team that is going to operate with machine-like precision and never waver in the face of adversity against a weekend against top-10 competition? Or is this a team that may not be ready for primetime and is going to need to find themselves over the course of the next few months?

Viva the Matadors: I would say the fans do especially when these events are so early in a season. Teams are just starting to feel out their rotation and lineups it is just too soon to get any meaningful conclusions for a staff to evaluate. However fans get to flex and talk trash and try to claim bragging rights. While this kind of event is awesome competition for the teams the fans get a lot more out of it for the long haul.

Who are a couple players on your team that opposing fans should know/are worth the price of admission to watch?

Frogs O’ War: The Horned Frogs have a local product in freshman Elijah Nunez who seems like the kind of player that is going to make people take notice this spring. He coupled with Tommy Sacco (a defensive wizard at shortstop) and hard-hitting Gene Wood at first should be entertaining ones to watch. As far as pitchers Haylen Green is arguably the best swiss army knife arm in the sport Johnny Ray has serious Big League stuff and Austin Krob might be the best pitcher this weekend that no one has heard of. TCU hasn’t yet identified where the star power will come from this season but hopefully we will have a better idea after this weekend.

For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: Some vets. Tanner Allen returns for his senior season looking to make a statement. He’s been a dominant batter as well as performing wherever you need him in the field. His bat will be what makes the most noise this weekend though. Rowdey Jordan also returns for his senior season looking to be the guy on base. In previous years Rowdey would find a series rhythm where he was your guy to get on base. He’s got wheels the bat and the glove to draw the attention of MLB scouts this year.

Red Cup Rebellion: The weekend rotation has an argument to be the best in the country. Doug Nikhazy on Friday is going to be electric from the left side changing speeds and giving hitters fits with his location. Gunnar Hoglund is your prototypical MLB Draft buzz robot. Big physical presence on the mound mid-90’s fastball with a ton of movement and a hammer offspeed pitch to put you away. And rounding out Sunday is Derek Diamond an uber-aggressive competitor who is just starting to truly come into his own with his four-pitch mix.

Viva the Matadors: Dylan Neuse is all that and a bag of chips. He is probably going to do a lot of the consistent offensive lifting and his fielding doesn’t see much of a drop-off in talent either. Micah Dallas is a potential ace for this bullpen and looks to solidify himself as the dominant arm in crunch time. These two guys are basically the most well known Red Raiders across the country and with good reason. On a squad poised for another conference championship and a run to Omaha they lead the pack.

Which game are you most looking forward to and why?

Frogs O’ War: These are all great matchups but the Friday afternoon game with Ole Miss is the one I am most looking forward to. They are the highest rated SEC team in the field and it’s a team the Frogs have seen before (in Houston at the Shriners’ College Classic). I also hope there is some revenge against Arkansas Sunday who beat TCU in the Fayetteville Regional back in 2019.

For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: Tough question… I would say many Mississippi State fans are excited to face off against TCU who we have never played in program history. It’s always exciting to play another solid college baseball program that you’ve never faced off against.

Red Cup Rebellion: To be honest it’s hard to pick a favorite. We always love mixing it up with our friends from the Big 12. Although we aren’t exactly partial to the last time we played the Longhorns.

Viva the Matadors: Probably Mississippi State or Arkansas. Tech has more recent history with those two and did not come out well from the series last time with the Bulldogs. So I would be leaning towards the MSU game but all of them are going to be great.

TCU skipper Jim Schlossnagle said that he could see “a team go 0-3 [this weekend] and still make the CWS”. What does that say about this field and how accurate do you find that statement?

Frogs O’ War: Oh absolutely. The odds say that not all of these teams will be together again in Omaha of course but I wouldn’t be shocked if 3-4 teams find themselves in Nebraska this summer. These are well coached teams with incredible talent veteran-laden rosters and elite level pitching staffs. Every single one of them can claim that their goal is to play for a National Championship without it sounding hyperbolic.

For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: This crew of teams competing this weekend could very well make the CWS. Many of these teams know how and when to find their rhythm before the postseason. I wouldn’t base everything on this upcoming weekend.

Red Cup Rebellion: That’s a fact. It’s very possible that three or four teams from this weekend’s event make it to Omaha.

Viva the Matadors: It is so early in the season that statement would be true no matter what but especially with the competition this weekend. While all the teams are going to be breaking in their squads the rust will hide someone’s true potential I guarantee it. All these teams are going to be in the thick of their conference races which makes this such an insane field. If Vegas offered the odds I’d be reasonably comfortable betting one of these teams wins it all.

Who do you expect to ‘win’ the Showdown?

Frogs O’ War: I want to go with the homer pick and choose TCU but I think Texas Tech is primed to come out of the weekend 3-0. The Red Raiders are going to be a big giant pain in the you know what come Big 12 play this spring.

For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: I imagine most of our authors here will go with the obvious: Themselves… or in my case the DIAMOND DAWGS.

Red Cup Rebellion: It’s tough to say so we’ll go with the easy answer: Rebs

Viva the Matadors: I expect Tech to put on quite the show. These challenges are great because it is always theoretically best-on-best matchups. Tech’s best is really darn good it is tough to see a scenario they aren’t 3-0 when all is said and done. My numero dos option would be TCU they can prove a lot with a dominant showing in this shindig and they are a tough squad.

What is the realistic expectation in 2021 for the program that you cover and why?

Frogs O’ War: TCU followed four straight CWS appearances with two down seasons (by their high standards at least) missing the postseason altogether in 2018 and limping out of the Fayetteville Regional in 2019. Last year had the makings of a team that could make a run but that season as we all know was over before it truly even began. Well every single senior on that roster elected to return and TCU lost just one recruit to the MLB Draft so the expectations for 2021 are through the roof. This is a team that expects to get to Omaha and win once they are there. The Horned Frogs have been so close to winning it all too many times… maybe this is the season they can finally get over the hump.

For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: The expectation for Mississippi State baseball is to make it to Omaha. That’s the expectation every single year and it doesn’t change in 2021. The expectation may even rise this year because of the returning + recruited talent that is all over the Mississippi State 2021 roster.

Red Cup Rebellion: At this point it’s hard to give the canned “Omaha or bust” response but Mike Bianco and Ole Miss have built a nationally-relevant program that is on the cusp damn near every year. With the aforementioned rotation and a ton of offensive production back I would be lying if I said I don’t expect this bunch to be in a Super Regional somewhere with a great chance to go to Nebraska.

Viva the Matadors: Losing Hunter Dobbins is a blow that potentially lowers the ceiling for the Red Raiders. Omaha is all about pitching depth and Dobbins was a big piece of that equation for Tech. Still there is definitely the sense that Tadlock is due his first national title and I don’t think that’s unrealistic as a goal for this season. This team is as good as any the question becomes can someone step in and give enough high quality innings to minimize losing a weekend starter in preseason."
GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlcy9nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLXRoZS1zZWN1cml0eS1iYXNlZC1saW5lLW9mLWNyZWRpdC1kaWZmZXJlbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs: The Security Based Line of Credit Difference,"Securities-based lines of credit (SBLOC’s) can be valuable tools as advisors aim to meet clients’ liquidity needs

“Clients all across the wealth spectrum come to advisors with liquidity needs. Whether they want to make an offer on the vacation home of their dreams or need a quick infusion of cash to avoid penalties on a high tax bill the funding has to come from somewhere. And while advisors have a variety of ways to meet immediate liquidity needs some options may be more appealing than others” says Gary Basso head of institutional sales and distribution at Goldman Sachs Private Bank Select® or GS Select®.

The Security Based Line of Credit Difference

Securities-based lines of credit (SBLOC’s) can be valuable tools as advisors aim to meet clients’ liquidity needs

For example liquidating an investment might trigger transaction costs and tax implications. It also could create opportunity costs since the client will be out of the market until they build that position back up. At the same time an advisor may need to make additional changes to a client’s portfolio to keep it aligned with the client’s long-term financial strategy.

Tapping a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is another common alternative for filling a short-term liquidity need. But it presents a different set of challenges. “Since the financial crisis HELOCs have been harder to get and the new tax laws mean interest expenses might not be deductible” says Basso. Opening a HELOC can also be a cumbersome and slow process taking weeks or even months to set up. Selling or leveraging other types of assets may be possible but matching an asset that has the right value and as a source of liquidity to fund a current need can be a tricky proposition.

A securities-based line of credit (SBLOC) can be an excellent solution for bridging liquidity gaps with fewer complications. While advisors have traditionally been more likely to encounter SBLOCs in a wirehouse setting GS Select has integrated them into its digital platform giving a broader range of advisors and their clients more convenient access to these products. And with a streamlined approval process the funds can be available in a fraction of the time required by other lending options.

“The key feature of an SBLOC is that it gives clients opportunistic access to liquidity” Basso says. That capability allows clients to act quickly in a range of common scenarios typically associated with a lifestyle purchase life event or business investment. However Basso cautions that advisors and clients should consider the potential risks of this approach especially for loans where principal may be outstanding over a longer period of time. In particular interest rate fluctuations could change the overall cost of borrowing and market declines could reduce the amount a client can borrow using a given security as collateral resulting in a call for partial repayment or additional collateral.

Real estate purchases

Real estate is one of the most common areas in which SBLOCs can demonstrate their utility. “Whether residential or commercial real estate moving fast with cash might allow you to seize an opportunity more quickly” says Basso. In the residential sector access to liquidity can mean greater flexibility since buyers don’t feel obligated to sell their old home before purchasing a new one.

Basso also points out that while retirees may have substantial wealth they can also run into difficulties getting a mortgage because of limited income. “That situation can make a conventional lending strategy a lot more difficult” he says.

Tax obligations

SBLOCs give advisors another tool for clients have unexpected tax obligations. “For instance the sale of a business can incur a sizable tax obligation” says Basso. The tax liability must be paid when due to avoid penalties but there’s often a question as to whether it’s better to borrow money or simply pay the taxes outright by liquidating investment. “We can often demonstrate that it’s more beneficial to borrow especially in today’s low-rate environment” says Basso. “In many cases an SBLOC could easily be more cost-effective than being out of the market on a substantial amount of your investment assets.”

Business needs

For business owners SBLOCs can free up cash to purchase equipment or even finance accounts receivable smoothing out cash flow. Basso points out that access to cash can be critical for a young business without enough of a financial history to qualify for more traditional financing. “As businesses grow SBLOCs can also provide the capital they need to make targeted acquisitions” he adds. “For example a younger dentist or financial advisor may want to purchase the practice of a sunsetting practitioner.”

Other short-term opportunities

Basso also sees SBLOCs as a useful alternative to traditional consumer financing options in some cases. “These lines of credit can be tens of millions of dollars but they can also be quite small making them a good fit for a down payment on a child’s first home paying a tuition bill or financing a wedding” he says. This alternative can be especially appealing for people with variable income. People with large one-time income from the sale of a business or real estate for instance could invest the proceeds of that sale immediately while securing an SBLOC with those investments to make tax payments when they come due.

Emergency funds

In an unexpected disaster SBLOCs can be useful source of emergency cash. Basso knows of a commercial property owner heavily invested in retail who used an SBLOC to help offset rent that his tenants were unable to pay when the coronavirus pandemic hit. “It was potentially a risky move but it may have been less risky than letting tenants give up their spaces entirely leaving them vacant” he says. In other cases Basso has seen clients draw down an SBLOC in advance of an insurance payout to jump-start the repair process following a natural disaster such as a hurricane or tornado.

Ease of access

Recognizing the utility of SBLOCs for clients is only half the battle. “GS Select has worked to make these products much more client-friendly making it easier for clients to weigh the merits of them compared to other options” says Basso. A digital-focused design makes the application and approval process both streamlined and transparent giving both clients and advisors easy access to information about the product.

Basso hopes this ease of use will bring these flexible products to a wider client base. “It’s exciting that these products and services that advisors might only have seen in a wirehouse or regional private bank environment are now available to independent advisors in an easy-to-use platform” he says.

And looking at copper which is already where it traded just before the global financial crisis...

... it is only a matter of time before we see a new all time high. Indeed overnight copper extended its surge to a nine-year high as Goldman Sachs warned of a historic shortage with ""the market now on the cusp of the tightest phase in what we expect to be the largest deficit in a decade"" as Chinese buying ""triggers the next leg higher"" adding to expectations that prices will near a record sooner rather than later. Here are some highlights from a note published overnight by Goldman analyst Nicholas Snowdon:

China’s return from the LNY holiday has heralded a burst of onshore investor copper buying after the holiday season with limited inventory builds evident so far. This latter trend during a period of what should be peak surplus generation onshore has particularly bullish implications given that the market is now on the cusp of the tightest phase in what we expect to be the largest deficit in a decade. The very low starting point for inventories at the beginning of this year has been further exacerbated by a counter seasonal stock draw so far in Q1 on a scale only seen once before in recent history (in 2004). These trends point towards a high risk of scarcity conditions over the coming months. In this context the fundamental outlook for copper remains extremely bullish with no evidence that current price levels are yet stimulating softening effects to reverse both spot and forward fundamental tightening trends. We continue to forecast the largest deficit in 10 years in 2021 (327kt) followed by an open-ended phase of deficits as peak copper supply (2023/24) and a record 10-year supply gap on the horizon. To reflect the rising probability of scarcity pricing our new 3/6/12M copper targets increase to $9200/$9800/$10500/t (from $8500/9000/10000/t previously). We consider below the key bullish increments for copper supporting the revision higher in price targets.

This means that Goldman now expects copper to be trading at record highs in 1 year. Anyway back to the note:

Chinese investors have refocused on copper. The absence of Chinese investor copper buying for the year-to-LNY period was a clear restraint on copper price action. Chinese buying had been the key buying channel from early November which took copper from $6600/t to $8000/t in just six weeks but then dissipated from year-end. However today on the open after a week holiday we saw SHFE copper interest increase by 22k lots (+8%) set against a strong rise in price (Exhibit 3). This points clearly to the return of very strong onshore investor buying. The absence of this investor flow pre-LNY was in our view predominantly related to typical position squaring into the holiday period rather than reflecting a substantially different view on copper. With that calendar restraint now passing we expect a sustained wave of Chinese buying. We would note that total SHFE copper open interest (324k lots) is still 16% below late November recent peak (377k lots) as well as 40% below record highs. Therefore we believe there is ample capacity for further onshore positioning extension in copper. We would also note that positioning on Western exchanges (LME COMEX) has remained relatively stable at significant net long levels but still substantially below record net length (COMEX money manager net long still 30% below September 2017 record net long). In our view the market remain some distance from approaching peak spec long capacity

Citi agreed with Goldman expecting a substantial supply deficit until at least 2023.

Three years later the boom turned into a bust and Bentley was laid off. Confronted with grim oil industry job prospects she rolled the dice and set out to create a cowboy boot company to sell her original designs.

Bentley’s City Boots officially launched in 2019 is competing in a category with well-established brands such as Ariat Justin Lucchese Nocona and Tony Lama and heavily backed newcomers like Tecovas. But the Western boot market is expected to grow to nearly $2 billion in annual U.S. sales by 2025.

What makes her boots different? That takes Bentley back to her youth growing up in Amarillo. Wearing distinctive boots was a rite of passage during her childhood.

“Boots have always been a family deal” said the 30-year-old. “It was a big deal when your granddad took you to go buy your first pair of boots.”

At SMU she’d wear vintage boots she found on eBay or Etsy to social events or classes — often prompting non-Texans to ask her where she found such unique footwear.

“I thought it was interesting that people didn’t know where to buy cowboy boots” Bentley said. “That was the first spark for the idea for the company.”

At Halliburton she noticed that her male co-workers frequently wore nice cowboy boots to the office but she struggled to find women’s boots appropriate for business professional attire.

That’s when two ideas merged: She could sell cowboy boots online to female working professionals. Outside of her 9-to-5 job Bentley began designing her own boots and splurged on getting 50 pairs made at a factory in Mexico.

The first pair arrived a week before she was laid off.

“It was kind of divine timing” Bentley said. “I had saved enough money to live for a year and I just went for it … and really have not looked back.”

Initially Bentley relied on home and trunk shows to get the word out about her handmade creations. When she’d hear about interested customers her grass-roots marketing meant packing up boots in her car hitting the road and driving around Texas.

“Anytime somebody buys a pair of boots it’s a great feeling that somebody wants what I’ve made” she said.

In 2019 City Boots opened its first showroom available to the public once a week and by appointment in shared space at Local Design Studios + Galleries in Fort Worth. She and other entrepreneurial women use the space to actively promote each other’s female-owned businesses.

Today City Boots offers about 10 different selections and styles at any given time costing $850 to $1350 a pair. Sales extend beyond Texas and the Southwest to customers from Florida to California.

“It’s so fun to see boots go beyond what would be considered the traditional Western area” Bentley said.

She also sells online at cityboots.com and at the soon-to-open LoveShackFancy at Highland Park Village.

Bentley was excited to put together a Dallas collection with boots named after well-known streets. Popular styles like the Preston the Hillcrest and the now-discontinued Lovers Lane were named in appreciation of her time at SMU.

Amid the challenges of the pandemic City Boots had higher 2020 fourth-quarter revenue than in all of 2019 Bentley said. She expects annual sales to top $1 million this year.

“There is a creative aspect” she said. “But so much of what I do is looking at the business as a whole where we can get returns and where we’ve been able to grow the business with cash flow.”

When Fort Worth’s annual stock show and rodeo was canceled for this year Bentley feared the company would lose a major source of income. She said sales remained surprisingly strong.

“People are doing more outdoorsy things because of COVID and they need boots” Bentley said. “Everything has become more casual.”

In the past year and a half Bentley has hired six employees who fill a variety of full-time seasonal and commission-based roles to help her build the business.

When reflecting on her six-year journey from unemployment to entrepreneur Bentley said the greatest challenge has been growing the confidence to approach people who knew nothing about her company.

“I had no retail experience and no design experience” she said. “I just knew what I liked. I was hoping others would like it too. And luckily they have.”

The Night Of

Kyle Rittenhouse raised his hands in the air as he stumbled toward the convoy of armored police vehicles his AR-15 bouncing against his legs.

Behind him three men who had chased him lay bleeding on the street. Two were dying and the third was in agony his right bicep blown off.

Kyle a teenager from Illinois had traveled to Kenosha Wisconsin where he picked up a semiautomatic rifle he'd bought illegally. He had inserted himself into the third straight night of rioting that erupted over the police shooting of a local resident named Jacob Blake. Then when he found himself engulfed by the chaos and violence in the streets he opened fire.

Now as police arrived at the scene Kyle tried to surrender. He approached the oncoming vehicles hands above his head. Bystanders pointed and shouted that he was the gunman.

And then … nothing.

One after another the police drove past Kyle lights flashing. An officer screamed at him to get out of the way.

""Clearly"" Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis later explained the officers at the scene were ""not seeing him as a suspect or a threat of any kind.""

The moment was emblematic of the nationwide tensions that had sparked a summer of civil unrest. To supporters of Black Lives Matter it was another glaring example of a racial double standard in policing. Just a few nights before officers in Kenosha had shot Blake — a Black man who was armed with a knife and resisting arrest — seven times in the back leaving him paralyzed for life. A white teenager who had gunned down three people with a far more dangerous weapon meanwhile couldn't get arrested even when he tried.

But on the right a movement sprang up to celebrate Kyle as an all-American hero. Fox News portrayed him as a patriot who stood his ground against an angry mob. His mother Wendy received a standing ovation at a conservative convention. The notorious far-right lawyer L. Lin Wood rushed to represent Kyle raising millions of dollars in donations for his legal defense. Officials in the Department of Homeland Security were instructed to depict Kyle in a sympathetic light. Even President Donald Trump waded into the debate speculating that Kyle ""probably would have been killed"" had he not pulled the trigger.

The right's lockstep defense of Kyle Rittenhouse offered an ominous foreshadowing of the insurrection at the Capitol in January when an armed and violent mob stormed the building and battered police officers. While Trump had appealed to millions of Americans including Kyle with his campaign mantra of ""law and order"" the words actually endorsed a lawlessness as old as America itself. Many of his supporters have come to believe they should be free to do whatever they like wherever they like — be it refusing to wear a mask in a grocery store calling for the assassination of political opponents or showing up to a riot with an illegal weapon. The siege on Congress was simply an extension of the principle established in Kenosha: The law ultimately is whatever ""patriots"" say it is.

Kyle a boy who loved police and guns and the president came to believe it was both his right and his duty to preserve law and order as he saw fit. A few hours before the shootings he told a reporter why he had traveled to Kenosha gun in hand. ""People are getting injured"" he said standing in front of a car dealership with other heavily armed vigilantes. ""Our job is to protect this business. And part of my job is to also help people.""

II. An All-American Boyhood

Kyle spent much of his young life imagining himself as a savior.

He struggled in school but participated eagerly in cadet programs at his local police station and fire department. He was disqualified from joining the Marine Corps but was hired as a part-time lifeguard at the Hastings Lake YMCA a job that would teach him the basic first-aid skills he would later offer to protesters in Kenosha.

And when a relative attempted suicide twice it was Kyle who called 911 both times for help.

Kyle grew up in Lake County Illinois a cluster of quiet villages suburban neighborhoods and commuter towns. Though the county is one of the country's wealthiest Kyle's family struggled to get by. His mother Wendy worked as a nurse's assistant in a nursing home while raising Kyle and his two sisters on her own. Court records show she sued Kyle's father Michael for child support in 2014 and filed for bankruptcy in 2018.

Kyle's family moved repeatedly apparently unable to pay the rent. Liens and eviction records filed in the Lake County Circuit Court indicate that they owed money to several landlords. Their last known address was a small apartment complex tucked behind an industrial park in the town of Antioch.

On a recent visit the family's old apartment on the ground floor appeared empty a small barbecue abandoned outside. Neighbors said Kyle's family had lived there less than a year. One woman who chatted with Kyle while he was walking a dog last summer described him as ""nice and sweet as could be."" But the family had left in a hurry within days of the shootings as protesters and reporters descended on the neighborhood.

Kyle had a tough time in school. In 2017 Wendy filed for an order of protection on Kyle's behalf against a 13-year-old bully who was calling Kyle names and threatening to hurt him. The bully ""comes to my apartment and yells at my apartment to my son Kyle calling him names and tell him that he is going to kick his butt"" Wendy wrote in the petition. ""Last month in December they call me and telling me that I need to watch my son or he is going to get hurt."" Kyle ended up dropping out of school after only one semester.

Things weren't any easier at home. According to police reports obtained by Insider Kyle called 911 twice to report a relative's suicide attempts — first in May 2018 when he was just 15 then again in May 2020 when he was 17. Both times Kyle told dispatchers and police officers that the relative had swallowed large quantities of pills. Both times the relative was rushed to a hospital by ambulance.

Kyle deeply admired police officers and joined a cadet program that gave him a uniform and hands-on training. Grayslake-Lindenhurst-Hainesville Public Safety Program/Facebook

It's no surprise then that Kyle spent his teenage years idolizing those charged with protecting the weak and standing up to bullies: the police. As a police cadet Kyle was eligible to receive basic firearms training and to ride along with officers on patrol. He also joined the fire cadets who met every other week for hands-on instruction and accompanied firefighters on calls. But when Kyle tried to join the Marines he was turned away. Enlistment typically requires the equivalent of a high-school diploma.

It was as if Kyle was playing dress-up auditioning for a role in law enforcement. Before Facebook removed his profile it was filled with photos of him in uniform sporting military-style camouflage police bomber jackets trooper hats and even firefighter gear. In one picture he posed with a rifle — apparently the same one he would use in Kenosha — wearing American-flag-themed Crocs and a broad smile.

Kyle was also drawn to Trump who warned that violent elements in society were waging war on the police. In January 2020 Kyle traveled to Des Moines Iowa to attend a campaign rally for the president. Standing in the front row just feet from Trump he looked up at the stage in awe as the president railed against ""crime corruption and chaos"" and praised ""the incredible heroes of law enforcement.""

Kyle did what he could to support the police. He frequently posted on his Facebook page about Blue Lives Matter a pro-police countermovement created in response to Black Lives Matter. On his 16th birthday he asked his friends to celebrate by donating to Humanizing the Badge a pro-police nonprofit organization. His Instagram biography featured the slogans ""Trump 2020"" and ""BLUE LIVES MATTER.""

""Bruh I'm just tryna be famous"" his profile read.

In a sense it was Kyle's childhood — his small-town roots his hardscrabble upbringing his reverence for anyone in uniform — that has made him an ideal symbol for the far right. Here was a boy who wanted to grow up to be a policeman a boy willing to take up arms to defend a city beset by racial unrest. Twitter fan accounts have tracked every detail of his case and traded memes mocking Kyle's victims while his mother raised money for his defense by selling ""Free Kyle"" merchandise including sports bras and bikinis. ""He's a national treasure and a hero"" one anonymous donor to Kyle's defense fund told Insider. ""An American hero.""

In the handful of interviews he has given Kyle comes across as bold and self-assured. He is articulate when he speaks and was confident enough in Kenosha to bark friendly commands at police officers journalists protesters and armed vigilantes more than twice his age.

But in his perpetual desire to help Kyle sometimes seemed prone to intensifying rather than de-escalating conflicts. One widely circulated video taken early last summer appears to show him jumping into a brawl between several teenagers and repeatedly slugging a girl from behind.

In Kenosha in an interview with Richie McGinniss of The Daily Caller just hours before the shootings Kyle presented himself as a selfless fearless protector. He knew danger was all around him and he was ready for battle.

""If there's somebody hurt I'm running into harm's way"" he said. ""That's why I have my rifle because I need to protect myself obviously.""

III. The Vigilantes

It's easy to see how hero fantasies may have drawn Kyle to Kenosha where yet another police shooting had sparked civil unrest. On August 23 a Kenosha police officer had fired seven bullets into the back of Jacob Blake who was resisting arrest. The shooting was filmed by a bystander with a cellphone and the footage quickly went viral.

Kenosha erupted. During the days the protests remained largely peaceful; in the evenings they devolved into mayhem and violence. For three nights in a row rioters torched cars and razed buildings leaving businesses in ruins and residents homeless. Police fired back with rubber bullets and tear gas and Wisconsin's governor activated the National Guard. All told city officials estimated that the riots caused $50 million in damage.

On the evening of August 25 right-wing vigilantes began arriving in Kenosha determined to confront Black Lives Matter protesters and rioters. Kevin Mathewson a member of a group that called itself the Kenosha Guard created a Facebook event calling for ""patriots willing to take up arms and defend [our] City tonight from the evil thugs."" Facebook which has since removed both the Kenosha Guard page and Kyle's profile has said there is no evidence Kyle was part of the online group or was even invited to the event.

Kyle in fact was already in Kenosha. The day before he had come to the city a half-hour drive from his home to work a shift as a lifeguard at a local pool. After he was off duty he and his sister spent the night at the home of his friend 19-year-old Dominick Black where they watched livestreams of the violence unfolding downtown. Kyle as usual was eager to make himself useful. The next morning the trio headed out to help with the clean-up scrubbing graffiti off the side of a school.

When his mother arrived to pick up Kyle and his sister he decided to stay in Kenosha. He told Wendy he was going to hang out at Black's house again. In reality the pair headed to a car dealership they believed was hiring private guards for the night. The co-owner of the dealership has denied that he hired anyone to protect the business nor did he want or endorse their help. But the promise of a ""job"" as an armed guard even an unpaid one seemed like just the sort of role Kyle had been dreaming of.

With his cowboy boots AR-15 and military-style rifle sling he'd purchased earlier that day Kyle fit in perfectly with the heavily armed groups in Kenosha that evening. It remains unclear how closely he was interacting with the vigilantes but he spent much of the evening alongside a member of the Boogaloo Bois an extremist antigovernment group known for wearing Hawaiian shirts and warning of an imminent civil war.

Kyle told The Washington Post he hadn't known any of the armed insurgents he met in Kenosha that night but they shared a common purpose. ""I'm not part of any group"" Kyle said. ""They were just complete strangers that were there to help protect the businesses with us. They just came with us to help so they just tagged along with us.""

Throughout the night Kyle was calm and assertive as he hollered out offers for medical aid and chatted with police officers and journalists. In numerous social-media videos he could be seen asking protesters if they were injured and misrepresenting himself as a certified EMT.

If the police were alarmed at the presence of so many right-wing vigilantes in their city they didn't show it. At one point Kyle barked out an order at a cavalcade of passing police vehicles. ""We need water"" he said.

An officer opened up the roof hatch and began tossing out bottles of water to the armed men surrounding Kyle.

""We appreciate you guys we really do"" a voice from inside the vehicle said.

None of the cops questioned whether the baby-faced teenager was old enough to legally carry the semiautomatic rifle strapped to his torso. In fact he wasn't. Kyle had persuaded Black to purchase the AR-15 for him months earlier. Kyle told The Post he had paid for it with $1200 he received in unemployment assistance after he was furloughed from the YMCA.

Kyle and Black had originally agreed to keep the rifle at the home of Black's stepfather who lived in Kenosha and to use it only when they went hunting. But when the pair decided to go to the car dealership that night Kyle insisted on picking up the gun and bringing it along.

Black later told police he knew Kyle wasn't old enough to carry the rifle. But he decided not to speak up fearing that Kyle would have ""thrown a fit."" Black now faces two felony counts of intentionally providing a dangerous weapon to a minor resulting in death.

Kyle's lawyers say he was ""legally entitled to open-carry the firearm under Wisconsin law"" citing a provision that allows minors to carry rifles and shotguns for hunting. Prosecutors have brushed the argument aside alleging that Kyle was ""hunting humans not deer."" State law they argue is clearly intended to bar minors from possessing dangerous weapons.

Kyle has said he has no regrets about bringing the AR-15 with him that night. ""I feel I had to protect myself"" he told The Post. ""I would have died that night if I didn't.""

IV. The First Shooting

The notion that Kyle would have been killed had he not armed himself has become gospel among his right-wing supporters many of whom have expansive views of their Second Amendment rights. John Pierce a prominent conservative activist who served on Kyle's defense team called the teenager's upcoming trial ""the most important case in the history of self-defense in the Anglo-American legal system."" Kyle he argued is the modern embodiment of the ""well-regulated militia"" protected by the Constitution.

In reality it's impossible to know whether Kyle would have lost his life in Kenosha had he not been armed. The very presence of his weapon after all threw additional fuel on what was already a raging fire. Throughout the night tensions had been mounting between the right-wing vigilantes and the protesters they had come to confront. According to CJ Halliburton an independent journalist known as ""CJTV"" who livestreamed the evening on Facebook many protesters were also armed. ""They had 'Justice for Jake' written on their helmets"" he told Insider. ""They were making it clear that they were there to defend Kenosha and the people from outside antagonists.""

Joseph Rosenbaum a 36-year-old Kenosha man seemed especially intent on taunting the vigilantes. In one video he was captured daring armed civilians outside a gas station to ""shoot me."" In another he could be seen helping to push a flaming dumpster across a street. In yet another he was naked from the waist up his shirt wrapped around his head swinging what appeared to be a chain.

Rosenbaum was not well. Just that morning he had been released from a psychiatric hospital in Kenosha following a suicide attempt. His fiancée Kariann Swart told The Post that Rosenbaum had recently been charged with domestic violence and had served three weeks in jail after violating a restraining order. As far as she knew he was homeless.

Kyle meanwhile had decided to leave his post at the car dealership and offer medical assistance to protesters. By the time he tried to return to the dealership police had barricaded the only route back. That's when Kyle crossed paths with Rosenbaum and the evening quickly descended into violence.

Several videos captured what happened next from multiple angles. After a brief confrontation Rosenbaum began chasing Kyle who turned and fled. As Rosenbaum gained ground he hurled the plastic bag he'd been carrying since his hospital discharge. It contained his underwear socks and a stick of deodorant.

The bag missed Kyle as he sprinted past a row of parked cars. Then as Rosenbaum caught up to the teenager a nearby protester fired a warning shot into the air. A video from the scene shows a muzzle flash just feet to the left of Kyle who turned to face Rosenbaum.

According to an eyewitness Rosenbaum tried to reach for Kyle's gun. The teenager raised his rifle and opened fire striking Rosenbaum four times.

Kyle ran behind the parked cars before circling back to Rosenbaum who lay bleeding out on the pavement. Kyle put his cellphone to his ear — but instead of calling 911 he dialed Black.

""I just killed somebody"" he told his friend.

V. The Pursuit

The sound of gunfire alerted everyone nearby to Kyle's presence. Halliburton the journalist began running toward the noise his camera rolling. He made it only half a block before he saw a wide-eyed terrified teenager clutching a rifle and running down the street. He was being chased by a mob of people screaming ""He shot somebody! He shot somebody!""

Kyle passed within 10 feet of Halliburton. ""I didn't shoot anybody"" he told the journalist.

""He looked scared"" Halliburton recalled. ""He looked like a little kid carrying a huge gun.""

As Kyle ran the crowd pursuing him grew.

""What'd he do?"" someone shouted.

""Just shot someone!"" a response came.

""Get his ass!"" another person yelled.

At that moment Kyle tripped slamming to the ground in the middle of the street. Rolling over to face his pursuers he raised his rifle. Some slowed as they approached jerking away at the sight of the gun. One protester appeared to kick Kyle in the head.

Anthony Huber a 26-year-old skateboarder from Kenosha who had joined the pursuit was undeterred. Running up to Kyle he bashed the teenager with his skateboard. Then as he reached for Kyle's rifle Huber appeared to lose his balance. Kyle fired one shot into his chest.

Gaige Grosskreutz a 26-year-old activist from Milwaukee was a few feet from Huber when he fell. Like Kyle Grosskreutz had arrived in Kenosha with a gun and a medical kit hoping to help the injured. Unlike Kyle he had experience working as a paramedic and he had a concealed-carry permit for his handgun.

Now as Huber lay dying in the street Grosskreutz paused. Holding his own gun he put his hands in the air. Then he darted toward Kyle who fired a shot into his right arm.

Grosskreutz doubled over. ""I need a fucking medic!"" he screamed as blood gushed from his arm. A nearby photojournalist moved in closer to Grosskreutz to get a better angle.

""There is no way — if you'd have seen the wound that I saw — you would've thought that that arm was going to stay on his body"" said Halliburton who was feet from Kyle when he opened fire. ""It was a scary scary moment just watching the blood pumping out of his body.""

Screaming in pain Grosskreutz yelled that he had a tourniquet in his medic bag. Halliburton pulled it out and tried to save Grosskreutz's mangled arm. ""There was just enough of his arm left above the bicep to get the tourniquet on which was another miracle"" Halliburton said.

As Halliburton fumbled with the tourniquet Grosskreutz guided him through the process.

""You're doing it wrong"" the medic told him.

""Help me"" Halliburton said.

""I don't know if I was talking to him or talking to God"" the journalist later recalled.

VI. The Standing Ovation

Hours after the shooting Kyle turned himself in to the police station in his hometown of Antioch. Between bouts of crying and vomiting he told officers he had ""ended a man's life"" and ""shot two white kids."" He faces five felony charges including murder attempted murder and possession of a dangerous weapon while under the age of 18.

Footage from inside the police station shows Kyle and his mother sobbing together their arms wrapped around each other. At one point Kyle asks an officer if he can go home and receive counseling for PTSD. At another he can be seen hyperventilating.

Kyle has maintained that the shootings were in self-defense. He and his lawyers declined to respond to questions from Insider as did his family and friends.

It didn't take long before conservatives began lionizing Kyle — and blaming protesters for the violence. ""Are we really surprised that looting and arson accelerated to murder?"" Tucker Carlson said on Fox News less than 24 hours after the shootings. ""How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?""

Michelle Malkin the far-right commentator brought Kyle's mother to an event for Republican women in Wisconsin where she received a standing ovation. Afterward Malkin proudly tweeted a photo of her and Wendy at the event. ""I was able to talk to Kyle by phone & THANK HIM for his courage!"" Malkin wrote. She ended the tweet with ""#fightback.""

The hashtag was a direct plug for the conservative lawyer and conspiracy theorist L. Lin Wood who had rushed to represent Kyle within 48 hours of the shootings. An organization Wood helped create #FightBack Foundation raised millions to cover Kyle's bail. But according to prosecutors it was also used as ""an unregulated and unreported slush fund"" to underwrite lawsuits that Wood was filing on behalf of Trump to try to overturn the election of Joe Biden. Given the fund's competing priorities some of the money raised to defend Kyle may have been used to spread misinformation on behalf of the president he idolized.

The fund's dubious uses surprised even some of its biggest donors. In November Wood announced on Twitter that Mike Lindell the MyPillow CEO and prominent Trump ally had helped raise money for Kyle's bail. But Lindell quickly issued a statement insisting that the headlines about the donation had surprised him: He had contributed $50000 to the foundation to support its election-fraud litigation not specifically for Kyle.

Eventually the defense fund run by Kyle's family announced the firing of both Wood and John Pierce the other conservative activist who had been representing Kyle. The family who said it had never ""received an accurate accounting"" for the money #FightBack raised in Kyle's name has created an independent trust to oversee all funds raised for Kyle's defense. Pierce has said he had no affiliation with #FightBack since taking Kyle's case and Wood has denied allegations of mismanaging the funds and said his foundation keeps detailed financial records.

Other organizations — including one that supports gun rights and another that backs right-wing vigilantes across the country — have reportedly given $100000 to Kyle's family to help with personal expenses. Another crowdfunding campaign raised nearly $600000.

But some donors who contributed to Kyle's legal defense freely admitted to Insider that their support doesn't have much to do with Kyle at all. In their eyes Kyle is simply a convenient way to give a middle finger to Black Lives Matter and anyone else they consider enemies of America.

In explaining their support for Kyle many donors ticked off long lists of conservatives who they feel have been unfairly maligned by the media and the left. Among those cited most frequently were Nicholas Sandmann the Kentucky high-school student who was filmed standing face to face with a Native American activist at the Lincoln Memorial and Mark and Patricia McCloskey the St. Louis lawyers charged with felonies after brandishing guns at protesters who were marching down their private street outside their home.

Ronnie Thomas a donor from Texas said he lives paycheck to paycheck and can't usually afford to aid political causes. But when he learned that major crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe and Fundly had shut down campaigns for Kyle citing violations of terms of service something in Thomas snapped.

""They made it political"" he said. ""This kid needed support. Nobody was willing to stand up for him. That was my way of saying 'enough.' Someone's got to step up and say we're tired of the peer pressure we're tired of being pushed around. I'm going to do what I can to support this kid.""

Roughly $20 was all Thomas could afford to give. So he along with 13000 other donors sent his money to a campaign hosted on the Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo.

Another Wyoming donor who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Kyle's case rekindled a frustration he'd felt when a friend called him racist for criticizing Obamacare. ""You cannot have a reasoned rational logical discussion right now and it's because of the left"" he said. ""These leftists believe Kyle is some kind of white supremacist Nazi. From what I've seen and read there is nothing to indicate that whatsoever.""

VII. 'Proud of Your Boy'

Whatever his political beliefs Kyle doesn't fit easily into well-established categories of deadly shootings. He is unlike the mass killers who have terrorized American schools churches and businesses in recent years. His actions in Kenosha though deadly were not indicative of a bloodthirsty rampage. He opened fire only on those who chased him a point his attorneys intend to make the centerpiece of his defense.

His case more closely resembles that of George Zimmerman the neighborhood-watch volunteer who followed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin through a Florida neighborhood in 2012 despite a 911 dispatcher's advice to stand down. Like Zimmerman Kyle dreamed of becoming a cop. Like Zimmerman he was lionized by the right for enforcing his own version of law and order. And like Zimmerman he stands a good chance at being acquitted at trial.

From a legal standpoint it may not matter whether Kyle was right or wrong to be in Kenosha after curfew with a gun he didn't legally own. Legal experts told Insider that the case against Kyle will come down to one key factor: whether the jury believes he had a reasonable fear for his own life when he pulled the trigger.

Under Wisconsin law Kyle can claim self-defense if he reasonably perceived a threat to his life and responded with an appropriate amount of force. Since Rosenbaum and Huber are dead it's impossible to know whether they intended to kill Kyle that night or if they simply hoped to disarm him. And since both men along with Grosskreutz were chasing Kyle — Huber wielding a skateboard and Grosskreutz a handgun — a jury could rule in Kyle's favor.

""The jury is required to acquit him if there's any reasonable doubt"" said Anthony Cotton the former president of the Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ""If the prosecution hasn't met that burden which is so insanely high they have to find this kid not guilty.""

In arguing that Kyle acted in self-defense his lawyers have repeatedly denied that he is affiliated with extremist or white supremacist groups. In the aftermath of the shooting even the armed vigilantes who fraternized with Kyle in Kenosha initially distanced themselves from him. Kevin Mathewson the Kenosha Guard organizer who issued the call for ""patriots willing to take up arms"" told reporters that Kyle ""had no business carrying a gun."" Ryan Balch the Boogaloo Boi seen walking with Kyle that night called him ""a kid who lied to the people he was with.""

But prosecutors in Kenosha remain skeptical. In January they obtained damning footage of Kyle who was released from a Kenosha jail in November on a $2 million bond flashing white-power signs at a bar with a group of Proud Boys. In the footage captured by the bar's security cameras Kyle is clad in a T-shirt that reads ""Free as Fuck"" posing with his fingers in the ""OK"" sign commonly used by white supremacists. Prosecutors alleged that Kyle was ""loudly serenaded by five of the adult males in his group with the song 'Proud of Your Boy' the anthem for the Proud Boys."" Kyle's lawyers insisted that he didn't know the men and has no ties to the group.

Like George Zimmerman before him Kyle Rittenhouse has become more an icon than an individual. His actions in Kenosha were the result of two intertwining motifs of the Trump era: a distorted ideal of personal freedom beyond restraint or consequences and a conviction that ""law and order"" is something that applies only to one's enemies never to oneself. Together those threads of twisted logic gave Kyle the audacity to show up in a city that wasn't his with a rifle he couldn't legally own believing he was the one with the law on his side. In picking up a weapon he himself became weaponized — not just by the far right but by the highest reaches of the federal government.

Perhaps the greatest irony has been the support he's received from those responsible for protecting America's cities. In an internal document leaked to the media last fall officials at the Department for Homeland Security were instructed to cast Kyle not as a threat to public safety but as a symptom of the widespread unrest over police violence.

The only way to exit the cul-de-sac is to drive onto Denton Street.

However when the county council repainted parking bays on the street last summer they failed to replace the double yellow lines at the top of her road.

Since then drivers have been parking close to the end of her road making it impossible for motorists leaving Metcalfe Street to see oncoming traffic.

Sharon who is a key worker at a supermarket fears she will soon have an accident if people are allowed to continue blocking the road.

Other users have been parking close to zig-zag lines at the crossing to use the cash point making the problem even worse.

She said: ""I'm trying to get the council to repaint the yellow lines on Denton Street as people are parking on street corners.

""It's very dangerous as it obstructs the view when coming out of side streets. The parking is terrible people are parking on zigzag lines at zebra crossings.

I""t is difficult to get out of my road because of selfish parkers. I've been her for 18 year and it's just got worse.

""There were double yellow lines but when the council re-did the parking bays they've not replaced them. It was maybe last summer

""I've had two near misses in two days with people beeping at me and flashing their lights. I nearly had an accident just the other day - surely it can't be right.""

Sharon has raised the issue with the council but has yet to receive an answer to her questions.

She has even contacted police about the problem but was informed there was nothing they can do as the vehicles are not parking illegally without the double yellow lines.

She says she would just like an answer over whether the council plan to replace the yellow lines.

Sharon added: ""It's really dangerous. I can't see to get out my own road. If I was in a big van or something I might be able to see but I'm in a little Fiesta how am I supposed to see?

""People are just parking anywhere they like. I don't know how other people on my street manage.

""I'm not going to park elsewhere - why should I?

""I'm putting my life in their hands - short of stopping someone and asking them to guide me out what can I do?

""I think I will have an accident. I have to come out four times a week.

""Putting yellow lines probably wouldn't stop everyone parking there but it might stop some of them. At least it would be restricted. At the moment there's nothing to stop them.

""The council can't do anything about selfish drivers but they can put the lines back!""

According to the Government's website the law states that drivers must not park on a pedestrian crossing including the area marked by zig-zag lines.

Drivers should also not not park opposite or within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction except in an authorised parking space.

By Ronni Newton

Harry’s Pizzeria & Tavern has had a presence in West Hartford for nearly three decades but owners Bob and MaryAnn Hagmeier said it is with heavy hearts that they are announcing the business will officially close its doors on March 14

“We’re really sad too” MaryAnn Hagmeier said Sunday. “We just couldn’t come to terms with the landlord.”

The lease runs out on March 31 and MaryAnn Hagmeier said they worked hard to negotiate a contract that would work in the current economic climate. When that wasn’t going anywhere they thought they had secured a buyer for the business but that potential buyer was also unable to come to terms with the landlord.

“We made some very reasonable proposals” she said noting that they have continued to pay a very expensive lease in full throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2017 the Hagmeiers bought Harry’s from founder Barbara Lang – who had moved the business from Hartford to 1003 Farmington Ave. in West Hartford in 1992. Harry’s moved to 39 South Main St. 10 years ago taking with it much of the same decor.

The Hagmeiers did a major remodeling and updating of the space in 2018 – remaining open for takeout throughout the process. The renovations included covering the walls with barn wood and creation of a 15-seat bar with high-top tables as well as a tweak of the name to include “Pizzeria & Tavern.”

“We’ve had tremendous support from the community” Bob Hagmeier said. The COVID-19 pandemic is not the reason they are closing he said.

“We have had the pleasure of working with an incredibly committed team who have helped us stay afloat during the past year and we thank you all from the bottom of our hearts” the Hagmeiers said.

The Harry’s name is not going to disappear however.

One outcome of the pandemic is that they have been challenged to “think outside the box” and as another revenue stream had already developed a line of individually hand-stretched premium frozen pizzas.

“We use the same high-quality ingredients that we use for our in-house pizza and we are getting rave reviews” they said.

“Harry’s Pizza” will continue to be in the name and finalization of the branding is currently underway.

Bob Hagmeier said they are in negotiation to secure commercial kitchen space and would love to eventually find a new permanent location to create the new product line in West Hartford.

The frozen pizza is currently available at Geissler’s Supermarket in Bloomfield Granby East Windsor and South Windsor as well as Highland Park Market in Farmington and Manchester. They plan to approach Crown Market Hall’s Market and perhaps Whole Foods as well regarding distribution of the frozen pizza product.

Harry’s Pizza is also available at some Connecticut breweries.

The contents of the South Main Street restaurant – including the bar lighting fixtures from Connecticut Lighting Center furnishing and fixtures all of which are less than three years old – will be offered for sale prior to the termination of the lease on March 31.

“The West Hartford community has been really supportive” MaryAnn Hagmeier said. “We are tremendously grateful.”

They said it has been a privilege to serve this community and they hope to continue the relationship through the frozen pizza product.

Updates on the expansion of the frozen line will be posted to their Facebook and Instagram (@Harryspizzaweha) as distribution expands throughout the year.

The case which also garnered the attention of local politicians was resolved Friday after the tenants reached an agreement with the owner of 170 Earle St. to postpone their eviction by 30 days the parties said during a hearing in Hartford Housing Court on Friday.

The mother reached Friday while she was at work declined to speak about the case. The Law Offices of Bruce Bergman which represent the landlord did not return a request for comment.

At right Cancel Rent CT activist Kerry Ellington uses a megaphone at a rally protesting the near-eviction of a Hartford family with young children. About 50 people attended the gathering at the corner of Earle and Barbour streets in the city’s North End.

The Connecticut Fair Housing Center — which learned of the case Thursday morning and stepped in to represent the tenant in court — says it was just one among more than 1000 eviction cases filed in Connecticut since the start of the pandemic. The long-anticipated wave of evictions has already started to break with 50 to 60 families and individuals being removed from their homes each week executive director Erin Kemple said.

While most tenants are still protected from eviction by the state and federal moratoriums which have been extended through the spring a growing number of people risk being left out in the cold.

Property owners can evict people who owe more than six months’ worth of rent since the start of the pandemic nearly 12 months ago.

“That’s a lot of people and landlords are absolutely going ahead and taking advantage of that” Kemple said.

In this case the tenants were also many months past due on rent before the pandemic according to the landlord’s complaint.

That’s not unusual either Kemple said. Even before the coronavirus crisis many working-class low-income people were struggling to get by and to find decent affordable housing. That’s only gotten harder with massive unemployment and other economic hardships caused by the pandemic.

But few evictions have garnered as much attention as the story of an anonymous Hartford family nearly forced out into the snow.

“It’s a criminal act of the state to put a mother and her child out on the streets in the midst of a global pandemic in the midst of a winter snowstorm in the midst of a legacy of economic and housing oppression in Black and brown working class communities in Connecticut” said Kerry Ellington of New Haven an activist with Cancel Rent CT.

It began when a marshal knocked on the family’s door earlier this week to start the process of removing them from 170 Earle St. a multifamily building in the heart of the North End. Grassroots organizers from several organizations connected with the family and members rallied on their street Thursday morning as the Connecticut Fair Housing Center applied for an injunction to halt the eviction.

The family — two adults and two children ages 1 and 6 — would become homeless if forced to leave the apartment which itself has “significant health code violations” the center wrote in the application.

State Rep. Brandon McGee who represents parts of Hartford and Windsor said he’s committed to helping any other tenants of 150 and 170 Earle streets a “prison-like” brick apartment complex that looks the same as it did when McGee was growing up on Barbour Street.

Now that he’s spoken to the family facing eviction he’s worried about the conditions others are living in.

“This is crazy that this has been allowed to go on so long” he said.

The city says a fire at the second building in the complex in January revealed some fire and building code violations and that repairs are ongoing.

“Overall the residents did not voice concerns about their buildings” Vasishth Srivastava the mayor’s chief of staff wrote in an email Friday afternoon. “We also checked our records of complaints and found few recent ones. However we will be going back to building and depending on our ability to access the units conducting inspections.”

The situation was publicized on social media by McGee who co-chairs the General Assembly’s Housing Commission and City Councilman Joshua Michtom whose wife Constanza Segovia is a lead organizer with Mutual Aid Hartford.

Their tweets which also reported that the landlord owed a large amount of property taxes to the city prompted Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin to look into the case.

Stephen Poland of the CT Right to Counsel Coalition left activist Cornell Lewis center and state Rep. Brandon McGee speak to one another at a rally against evictions near the corner of Earle and Barbour Streets in Hartford on Friday afternoon.

In fact MOKE Peace 18 Corp. — the Brooklyn-based company that owns both 150 and 170 Earle St. — has failed to pay nearly $340000 in Hartford property taxes since 2016 according to city records.

“We recognized the address and we knew we had some particular leverage” Srivastava said Saturday.

Over about a dozen phone calls on Thursday and Friday Bronin and his staff helped broker an agreement between the two parties in which the tenant would be evicted after 30 days but would not pay the $15000 they owed in unpaid rent according to Srivastava.

When the property owner backed out of the deal Bronin called and convinced him to go ahead with it.

Attorneys for the tenant and landlord presented the agreement to a judge at a hearing Friday afternoon. About 50 community members gathered in the snow near Earle and Barbour streets for a second time in solidarity with the family holding “Cancel Rent” signs and chanting “shelter is a birthright.”

They belonged to Mutual Aid Hartford Cancel Rent CT the Central Connecticut Democratic Socialists of America and the CT Right to Counsel Coalition which have been working together to both push for broad policy changes and help individuals in crisis.

Between Monday and Wednesday this week courts in Connecticut issued 42 warrants of eviction the orders that authorize law enforcement to remove evicted tenants according to Dahlia Romanow of the Central Connecticut DSA.

“We need to worry about the people who are evicted right now and we also need to think about the fact that there’s this huge crisis that’s coming and it’s happening” she said.

Sometimes tenants don’t know they’re facing eviction until a state marshal comes to remove them Kemple added.

“It’s unclear where people are leaving (eviction) notices especially in multifamily buildings so they may leave a notice in a common area and it ends up blown out the door or not getting in the right hands” he said.

McGee who also supports the “right to counsel” movement for tenants says the state’s housing crisis “is set to explode.”

“Today from my perspective was just a small example and it’s just really a microcosm of what is getting ready to happen” he said.

Not everyone was happy.,"A word to the wise: Tread lightly when speaking about the Whalers in Connecticut.

Hartford’s former NHL team now the Carolina Hurricanes invokes a sense of heartbreak and bitterness among the lingering diehards fans. That was on full display Friday when the Hurricanes unveiled their new throwback jerseys — and homage to the classic green and blue Hartford jerseys.

The Whalers who played in Hartford from 1972-97 before relocating to North Carolina are still a hot topic in Connecticut. Whenever Carolina does anything in reference to the Whalers strong reactions follow from folks in the north.

The Hurricanes wore the throwback jerseys in a 5-3 win over Chicago on Friday. Their Twitter account had some fun with it with whale-based puns and Brass Bonanza references all around.

Naturally not everyone enjoyed it.

I took a seat on the right so I could behold the Manhattan skyline when we crossed the Hell Gate Bridge over the East River. Morning papers in hand I went to the café car for coffee.

All was well as I traveled to a favorite destination on a favored mode of transportation.

My purpose was attending Toy Fair 2020 to publicize my then-latest book “Kid Number One: Alan Hassenfeld and Hasbro” the sequel to my 1998 title “Toy Wars.” The visit also would be a chance to reconnect with old friends and to break bread with them in city restaurants.

Penn Station was congested and frantic as always when I arrived. I walked to my hotel a boutique establishment near the Empire State Building settled in and had lunch at a restaurant across East 31st Street. That evening I dined in Koreatown and the next morning Saturday Feb. 22 I took an Uber ride to the Javits Center where Toy Fair was officially opening.

Thousands of buyers industry and company leaders and media members had gathered as they have annually for years. Exhibits and displays filled four floors of the center. Fun and games could have been the mantra — and the mood was merriment as we beheld timeless classics and the latest introductions from companies as large as Hasbro Lego and Mattel and as small as the many startups hoping their doll or warrior would be the next big hit.

The highlight of Day One first of four was the appearance of NBA great Shaquille O’Neal who was endorsing a line of Tonka Trucks. O’Neal invited attendees to be photographed with him a goodwill gesture he may have regretted when hundreds crowded around him.

The food courts and lounges were packed.

No one was social-distancing. No one was wearing a mask.

There was talk of a virus that had emerged in China where many toys are made but it was mostly concern that production might be affected. A month before the first case of what would be called COVID-19 was confirmed in Washington state and the next day I had written the first Journal staff story that mentioned it. Initially though no one I talked with in New York seemed worried it would become a scourge.

I returned to Javits for the second and third days of Toy Fair to record a Story Corps interview with Hassenfeld former Hasbro chairman and CEO and grandson of one of the company's immigrant founders. I traveled to a radio station in Brooklyn for a live appearance. I dined with a good friend and took several Uber rides.

And I can pinpoint the moment when I felt my first unease.

It was the third day and I was walking past a construction site near Fifth Avenue where laborers were on coffee break. One of them held his dust mask up to passersby and joked: “Get ‘em while you can! Bargain price! Just ten dollars!”

I walked faster.

Later that day a chatty Uber driver told me that if “that virus” as he called it came to the city he was going to stop driving. No upside to a steady stream of strangers in the back seat of your car.

In fact as later research would prove the virus was already in New York.

Now I was paying closer attention to recent events such as the early-February edict that travelers to the U.S. from China’s Hubei Province had to quarantine. I did not buy a mask but for the remainder of my time in new York I kept my distance from people sanitized and washed my hands frequently and was hyperalert for coughing and sneezing.

When my Providence-bound train pulled into Penn on Tuesday Feb. 25 I walked a good distance up the platform until I found a mostly empty car. I placed my coat and computer on the seat next to me so that no one would sit there. I did not visit the café. When I got home I began looking on Amazon for masks soaps and sanitizers.

On March 1 the first COVID case was reported in Rhode Island. Three weeks later with Toy Fair attendees having scattered back across the planet the Javits Center was being prepared for use as a field hospital.

As of this writing there have been 110.8 million known cases of COVID globally almost 29 million of them in the U.S. and 123145 in Rhode Island. Globally almost 2.5 million people have died including almost a half million Americans and 2367 Rhode Islanders.

And it’s not the only Hasbro board game being developed for TV — bingo games free to play and others like Risk are also headed for the small screen via Hasbro’s eOne production company.

While we wait to head back to Clue’s cursed mansion check out these eight other popular games that made it to TV all in game show form in the gallery below.

Boggle

Surviving less than a year on The Family Channel — an ancestor of Freeform — the 1994 game show Boggle: The Interactive Game brought “America’s most popular hidden word game” to the small screen with contestants spelling words from adjacent letter cubes just as you do with the game at home. The TV version didn’t catch on though perhaps because host Wink Martindale had to spend a minute and a half of airtime just explaining the game.

The Game of Life

The Game of Life which aired on Discovery Inc.’s now-defunct channel The Hub in 2011 and 2012 brought new life to the Milton-Bradley game of the same name. In this show families steered a car — which actually rocked side to side through all of life’s proverbial twists and turns — through an animated board and answered trivia questions along the way to earn “Life points” and a shot at the grand prize.

Monopoly

After creating Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune Merv Griffin tried bringing Parker Brothers’ ever-popular real estate game to television with contestants solving word puzzles to rack up properties from Mediterranean Avenue all the way to the Boardwalk. Monopoly lasted just three months on ABC before landing in TV jail. (The syndicated show Monopoly Millionaires’ Club hosted by Bob ♥ Abishola star Billy Gardell fared a bit better airing two seasons between 2015 and 2016.)

Pictionary

This charades-like drawing game inspired two syndicated game shows one in 1989 and one in 1997. In the latter celebrities and laypeople teamed up to get each other to guess doodled clues while Growing Pains star Alan Thicke hosted the proceedings. Lasting less than a year Pictionary is now known as the game show on which CHiPs star Erik Estrada socked Real Time host Bill Maher in the nose.

Scattergories

Legendary TV host Dick Clark emceed Scattergories a televised take on the party game in which players have to think of answers starting with a given letter to fit each category. In the game show version — which aired in 1993 and only 1993 — the contestants compared their answers to pre-recorded responses from celebrities including Betty White Alfonso Ribeiro Kelsey Grammer and Brian Austin Green.

Scrabble

“It’s the crossword game you’ve played all your life but not like this!” That’s for sure! By far the longest-running entry on this list NBC’s Scrabble lasted from 1984 to 1990 with a brief revival in 1993. Love Connection’s Chuck Woolery hosted the show reading clues for each word that was added to the Scrabble board one letter at a time Wheel of Fortune-style.

Taboo

Before TNN was Paramount Network and before Chris Wylde was a Young Sheldon actor they were the network and the host of Taboo a faithful adaptation of the guessing game where certain words are verboten for the clue-giver. It went off the air in 2003 after a solitary season.

Trivial Pursuit

Martindale of Boggle renown also hosted another board game adaptation on the Family Channel: 1993’s Trivial Pursuit. And the similarities didn’t end there: In both shows contestants rang in their answers through a phone keypad and in an interactive twist viewers could do the same from home. This trivia game inspired another show a decade and a half later: Trivial Pursuit: America Plays hosted by The Brady Bunch alum Christopher Knight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdGVybmF0ZWVuZGluZy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi90aGUtdHJhbnNmb3JtZXJzLXRoZS1tb3ZpZS0xOTg2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Transformers: The Movie (1986) - Movie Review,"A review requested by Jack with thanks to supporting Alternate Ending as a donor through Patreon Do you have a movie you'd like to see reviewed? This and other perks can be found on our Patreon page The anecdote that I think most faultlessly sums up everything there is to say about The Transformers: The Movie a 1986 feature cartoon adapted from a television series based upon a toy line is that the Hasbro toy company executives who paid for it and were very excited to see it usher in a new product line were completely unprepared for the outrageous backlash from upset fans and their parents when the series' main character a space robot who turns into a semi truck was killed at the break between the first and second acts (the parents also had a separate backlash when a film that could not possibly be more narrowly aimed at the 10-and-under set in addition to killing off a beloved character had another character yell ""oh shit!""). This tells us the two most important things: first obviously that the Hasbro people had absolutely no interest in this film as anything whatsover other than product. It has been noted many times that American children's television animation in the 1980s much more that at any other period in history was dominated by advertisements: many of the best-loved cartoon series were thinly-veiled toy commercials and sometimes ""thinly-veiled"" would be paying them a compliment. The Transformers which aired 98 episodes between 1984 and 1987 (the film was released and took place between the second and third seasons) is not the most egregious of these though it may be the most recognisable and certainly has had the longest cultural footprint.None of which should distract from the point: it is a toy commercial and anything else it might do was a second-order priority in comparison. For Hasbro and their Japanese partners at Takara the reason to do a movie was less for the sake of the movie than for having a grand-scale clearance event ushering out the old toys and announcing the even better new toys that you could go right to the store and buy on your way home from the theater. That anybody would care about this toy commercial enough to bother having a backlash at all was simply not part of their calculation. So that's what we're dealing with: not merely a product for which artistry wasn't expected it is maybe fair to call it a product from which artistry was deliberately banished.The other thing the anecdote tells is that despite this people did care and there was a backlash because of just how much people cared. So surely there must be something going on here.And for sure there's definitely something. I'm not going to pretend that The Transformers: The Movie isn't precisely what it is: it's selling a product. One cannot help but notice the way that every character is referred to by their given name repeatedly especially when we're meeting them for the first time the better to remember which one is which when Mom is helping you look on the higher store shelves. Not to mention that the new toys are all introduced while the old toys simply show up as though we'll know exactly who they are. Having long since mislaid the ancient memories that would tell me exactly who they are I confess to finding much of The Transformers almost mystifying in how damn little sense it makes; it's a constant barrage of visual auditory and narrative information that feels like it's sweeping us away on a tidal wave more than presenting a chain of events for us to follow. In principle this must work out properly since I'm certain that this didn't bother me as a five-year-old but all these years into adulthood I am more just kind of stunned and dazzled - not even in a bad way - by the unrelenting speed with which the 84-minute feature races through plot points and new narrative sequences.So while I can say that the story (credited to only one writer Ron Friedman but clearly this must have been the work of many notes from many executives in boardrooms on both sides of the Pacific) broadly describes how the Autobots the good alien robots that mostly transform into land vehicles are forced to temporarily pause their war with the Decepticons the bad alien robots that mostly transform into air vehicles because of the arrival of a robot that transforms into a planet that eats other planets I am not completely certain that I could tell you how every single piece of the film fits into that arc. I can at least tell you that it does so without belaboring itself which is why this is still an improvement over the series of similarly hectic but also achingly long movies directed by Michael Bay starting in 2007 with Transformers and ending ten years later with Transformers: The Last Knight (though I would put it below 2018's prologue/coda Bumblebee ). Plus The Transformers: The Movie generally has clear visuals showcasing its robot-on-robot action which is another reason to push it above the Bay movies.That's starting to get us in the direction of what actually does work about the film which is mostly that director Nelson Shin and Toei's animation director Morishita Kozo appear to have been fairly unique in that they seem to have taken it seriously. Shin had worked on The Transformers both with the Korean studio AKOM Production Ltd the company he founded and with the better-heeled Japanese studio Toei Animation who handled the bulk of the animation on this project and The Movie was the first time he and AKOM had real money to play with (it had a budget somewhere around six times what it cost to produce the equivalent number of minutes of the show). This means please understand that the movie cost in the neighborhood of $5 million which even in 1986 dollars was a ludicrously tiny amount of cash. But it was a lot for a toy commercial that had all of its production done in Korea and Japan as a money-saving venture and Shin clearly viewed it as a license to push himself and his animators to the edge of their abilities. The result is surely the best-looking most ambitious of all the cheap-ass animated features of the 1980s. Certainly it mops the floor with fellow Hasbro toy adaptations My Little Pony: The Movie (which preceded it into theaters by a couple of months) and G.I. Joe: The Movie (which in light of the terrible financial losses of both My Little Pony and The Transformers end up going straight to video in 1987). There's no obvious reason for this - those two films were mostly made by the same production teams drawn from Toei and AKOM (though My Little Pony was created on an extraordinary time crunch). But they were both directed by Americans and I wonder if that's part of the difference: in those films the animation was clearly just being done to fill an order whereas with The Transformers Shin got to have a real creative voice.A limited creative voice to be sure (again toy commercial) but it seems to have been enough. The Transformers: The Movie isn't the finest work of animation that you could see coming out of East Asia in 1986 (for reference that was the year that Miyazaki Hayao directed the first Studio Ghibli production Castle in the Sky ) but one gets the sense that Shin and Morishita wanted to create something special. This is a shockingly kinetic film: the virtual camera flings itself through spaces that seem to twist and turn along with our perspective moving around characters who have been drawn with a startling amount of shading and texturing. Some of these moments are there to add realism; some are there to emphasise the dramatic turns of the story as one particularly complicated turn that moves down to the ground and pivots slightly around a character as he makes a decision to movie into the next phase of the action. Sometimes I assume it's just because it looks extremely cool and allows Shin to show off the giant robots to look as iconic as the comic book superheroes that in a sense they were (comics published by Marvel were part of the overall Transformers multimedia empire and Marvel is in fact a co-producer on this film).Whatever motivates its the fact remains that The Transformers: The Movie is the unquestionable high-water mark of visual sophistication and ambition for anything produced by television animation's Axis of Terror in the 1980s: DIC Entertainment Filmation and Sunbow Entertainment (the latter of which handled all of Hasbro's animated properties including The Transformers). It invests in creating an elaborate sci-fi world set in the unimaginable future of 2005 20 years later than the first two seasons of the show; it treats that world as the backdrop for busy visual setpieces especially in the first third of the movie or so. It wants to be taken seriously as a science-fiction action epic bless its dear heart. This explains I imagine the elevated stakes involved in straight-up killing the protagonist and introducing swears; and perhaps the wall-to-wall heavy metal and rock soundtrack (some of which has gone on to become a generational touchstone) that frequently threatens to overwhelm the whole movie as some kind of strange music video. It also explains the film's astonishingly packed cast of famous people who obviously didn't know what the fuck they were doing. These include Judd Nelson Robert Stack Eric Idle Leonard Nimoy (who had the cheesy sci-fi background to kind of know what he was doing and so he gives by far the best performance of the ""names"") and notoriously as the planet-eating robot himself Orson Welles in the final performance of his lifetime when his voice had become so ravaged that he had to have his performance heavily distorted in post production. Which raises the question of why bothering to hire him at all. Unsurprisingly the best work is done by actual professional voice actors notably series mainstays Peter Cullen (who opens the movie by having a conversation with himself and it's adorably unconvincing) Frank Welker and Chris Latta. Cullen's work as the fatherly robot Optimus Prime is the heart and soul of the whole franchise and I am sure it's more due to his rich purring voice than anything else that the character's death was such a big deal; this isn't a franchise built to have emotional resonance and any amount it has comes from that man's vocal chords.At any rate the attempts to ""open up"" The Transformers: The Movie as an ambitious work of animation clearly didn't pan out: the film lost money and killed off Sunbow and Hasbro's dreams of feature films and you've probably never heard about Nelson Shin or his AKOM Production unless you like to watch the end credits of bad-looking episodes '80s and '90s American animated television shows. But it's always a nice treat when something that had no reason to be any good at all puts in that unnecessary effort. Simply put this looks good and parts of it are visually exciting and for a non-Disney animated feature in the mid-1980s that's pretty huge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbnRoYXRyYWNrcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2xsZWN0aW5nL215LTIwMjEtdGhlLWJsYWNrLXNlcmllcy1hbHRlcm5hdGUtbGluZS11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My 2021 The Black Series Alternate Line-Up,"It’s recently come to my attention that Hasbro recently revealed their new 2021 The Black Series action figures. Where was I? I have no idea but I want to join in. From what I can see Hasbro usually unveils around 4 figures at a time. However I’ve seen online contests that ask for around 10 choices on what YOU want The Black Series to offer. I’m not much of an action figure collector but I think this kind of thing is fascinating and super-neat from a graphic design point-of-view.

Here are my top ten choices….

Boba Fett [The Mandalorian] There are plenty of Boba Fett action figures but none from the brand-new canon series The Mandalorian! Complete with faded and pitted paint job Maori-style Gafferdi stick and of course firing missile! Also need to see a removable helmet with Boba’s scarred face. Ochi of Bestoon [Darth Vader comic series] Not the dead guy from Rise of Skywalker but the bad-ass Sith assassin from the new Darth Vader comic series… Bollux and Blue Max [The Han Solo Adventures] This one is truly old school. Bollux and Blue Max were from the original 1980’s Han Solo book series. Bollux is a Labor Droid while Max is an advanced slicer droid (a li’l blue cube) who literally lives in his chest cavity. Ren [The Rise of Kylo Ren comic series] The original Master of the Knights of Ren. A scarred Dark Side Force user with a cool face mask and red lightsaber. Avar Kriss [The High Republic] The main Jedi in The High Republic book Light of the Jedi. She’s a Jedi in her prime during the prime of the Jedi. A classical-looking warrior with a cool-looking lightsaber. Original Human Jabba the Hutt [Star Wars] This one is a bit unusual. Before the Special Editions of the original movies Jabba was played by a human being (Declan Mullholland who is probably as Irish and 1977 as he sounds) in a giant fur coat. He had a whole scene with Han Solo after the Greedo scene that was cut from the original theatrical release. The artists at Lucasfilm then took out human Jabba and replaced him with a younger-looking slug than the one first seen in Return of the Jedi. Cobb Vanth [The Mandalorian] The Marshall of Mos Pelgo. I want all the red highlights the rough armor and weaponry. I want the armor to look as ill-fitting as it does on film. Plus a firing missile. Oh and Timothy Olyphant’s face and facial hair. Lourna Dee [The High Republic] A twi’lek Viking space pirate with a cool mask and staff. She definitely needs to come with a removable mask so you can see her emaciated lekku (according to The Light of the Jedi). Durge [The Clone Wars comic series and cartoon] From the original Clone Wars Tartakovsky cartoon and Legends comic book series. He just looks cool he has a Mandalorian symbol on his chest armor and he’s basically indestructible. Don-Wan Khihotay [Original Marvel Star Wars comics] A crazy old man who thinks he’s a Jedi from the 1980’s Marvel Star Wars He has a lightsaber a Don Quixote mustache and beard and of course armor. There aren’t any action figures from those original comics and I think they should be acknowledged as the red-headed stepchild.

So any chance of any of these getting made?"

Hershey recently announced that it will be launching its plant-based sugar chocolates as a part of the ‘Better-for-you’ category with an investment in a company that is developing sugars that have fewer calories than conventional chocolates and a negligible glycemic index impact.

The U.S. chocolate giant Hershey that also sells other confectionary items has partnered with American Sugar Refining a member of the ASR Group a leading sweetener company to co-lead an equity investment in Bonumose a startup that works on innovations in plant-based food ingredients including rare and natural sugars.

Part of Hershey’s C7 Ventures this investment will open up new directions for the company’s growth as well as will kickstart an R&D partnership to offer not only reduced sugar chocolates but expand the BFY portfolio.

Bonumose created and patented a production process for high-purity rare sugars such as tagatose and allulose developed from plant-based low-cost abundant starches that the company claims has fewer calories than traditional sugars with a negligible glycemic index impact but the same texture and taste without the addition of dextrose or maltodextrin which is high on the glycemic index (GI) causing a spike in blood sugar and though it’s safe to consume in minimal quantities those with diabetes should prefer not taking it.

Without revealing any further details about the plant-based chocolate alternatives Hershey’s chief growth officer Kristen Riggs said: “We are the leader in US confection. And our consumers rely on us to understand their needs for everyday moments seasons and special occasions offering high-quality and great tasting candy that’s accessible for everyone. Expanding our expertise building new capabilities and delivering more choices in better-for-you confection is the next big category opportunity for us to lead.”

We’re setting the foundation for long-term sustainable growth in the better-for-you category. Everything we do is led by our consumers and our commitment to deliver only the most delicious snacks. We’re driven to provide more choices to ensure they enjoy our brands and products in ways that are right for them Chuck Raup president Hershey

The ‘Better-for-you’ category usually includes a multitude of interests such as those looking for plant-based ingredients and sugar reduction products. Previously Hershey worked on portion-controlled choices and now it plans to expand its range of products to include reduced sugar organic and plant-based alternatives.

Hershey President Chuck Raup said that the company is setting the foundation for long-term sustainable growth in the better-for-you category. “Everything we do is led by our consumers and our commitment to deliver only the most delicious snacks. We’re driven to provide more choices to ensure they enjoy our brands and products in ways that are right for them.”

Bonumose already has patents granted or allowed in the U.S. Europe China and many more with previous investors including Applied Food Sciences Cure8 Ventures Next Gen Nutrition Investment Fund and several more.

Rob Sproull ASR Group’s Senior Vice President of Sales Marketing & Product Development highlighted the group’s commitment to provide customers with solutions to meet their sweetening needs. “Sugar sets a high bar in terms of taste functionality and cost and most sugar alternatives fall short. Our investment in Bonumose expands our portfolio to provide customers with sugar alternatives that offer full flavor closely-matching functionality across multiple food and beverage applications and at a lower cost than other alternatives.”

With Hershey having more than 80 world-famous brands including stalwarts Reese’s Kit Kat Jolly Rancher SkinnyPop and Pirate’s Booty and which drive more than US$8 billion in annual revenues this new addition could disrupt the plant-based sugar chocolate market around the world.

Vegan chocolates are having a moment around the world with several brands investing in these products for instance just days ago according to an insider organization global food giant Nestlé will be soon unveiling a vegan version of its KitKat chocolate having vegan chocolate’ as its first ingredient and created using vegan wafers.

James Cadbury the owner of artisan chocolate brand Love Cocoa also announced plans to debut Happiness in Plants (HiP) a new chocolate line that is entirely vegan. Last year Swiss chocolatier Lindt & Sprüngli also announced it will launch a range of vegan chocolate bars created with oat milk and available in 100% recyclable packaging.

For The Daily News

Palmyra and Hershey waited a long time for their initial Mid-Penn Keystone Division girls' basketball meeting of the season.

In a game that was postponed four times due to pandemic quarantine or weather the local rivals finally got to square off Saturday afternoon at Palmyra.

Considering the Cougars hadn't played since Feb. 6 they made an excellent account of themselves with an emphatic 47-29 win.

Senior Katelyn Becker hit five 3-pointers on her way to a game-high 21 points with junior Zoe Smith chipping in 13.

When the Cougars' leading scorers combine for 34 points they can be plenty tough.

What was more impressive was their team defense in holding the Trojans to 29.

Hershey entered the game with five straight wins over Palmyra.

""We hadn't beaten Hershey since my freshman year on our floor"" Becker said.

Which meant that underclassmen like Smith a junior had never beaten Hershey including two years ago when the Cougars won the District 3-5A championship behind Amelia Baldo and Olivia Richardson.

The win left Palmyra at 7-5 and ranked No. 11 in the current power rankings to Hershey's 6-7 and 15th ranking.

Despite the long layoff rookie coach John Polly had his team ready to play.

""We had three practices since we last played on Feb. 6 including (Friday) night"" Polly said. ""We did Zoom meetings every day to keep the players engaged with each other and the coaches.""

Becker said it wasn't all that easy.

""We worked out 45 minutes every day on our own to stay in shape"" she said. ""As far as shooting I don't have a hoop at home. There's a playground a couple of blocks away but snow didn't make that very easy.""

Becker hit three 3-pointers in the second quarter as Palmyra opened a 23-17 lead.

The Trojans were showing signs of frustration. Their normal attack is to work the ball inside to leading scorer Anna Coulter who was held to 5 points. Senior guard Paige Day hit two 3-pointers to lead Hershey with 6 points.

""The defensive job Zoe Smith did on Anna Coulter was phenomenal"" Polly said.

The basic plan for Palmyra was to pressure the ball in the back court which led to 21 Hershey turnovers.

Then when the ball did make it inside to 5-10 Coulter 6-0 Amelia Rogers 6-0 Ellie Fasick or 5-11 Julia Zakovitch Cougars Mallory Margut Maddie Henry and KK Hamilton collapsed around the ball.

""We out-rebounded them 33-25 despite us being undersized"" Polly said. ""I can't say enough about our effort underneath the basket.""

Hershey's other main threat Mary Cotter was held to 5 points with Becker defending her.

""Pressure the ball and step into passing lanes"" Polly said to his team.

What resulted was a 16-0 run in the third quarter that opened a commanding 41-20 lead.

""I have to give coach Polly a lot of credit"" Hershey coach Josh Orris said. ""They took us out of what we normally like to do. We fell totally out of sync.""

Hershey's other leading scorer Zoe Carlson got into foul trouble and never got going offensively.

""Katelyn Becker got hot in the second quarter"" Polly said ""and it carried over into the third.""

Becker hit her fifth 3-pointer with 2:19 left in the third quarter and Smith and Elena Cota also hit treys to highlight the 16-0 run.

""This is a huge step to where we want to go"" Polly said ""which is to the district playoffs.

Palmyra has three games remaining against Annville-Cleona Hershey and Lower Dauphin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY2hvY29sYXRlaG9ja2V5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL2Nvbm5vci1tY21pY2hhZWwtc2NvcmVzLWhhdC10cmljay1pbi1oZXJzaGV5cy0zLTEtdmljdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Connor McMichael scores hat trick in Hershey's 3-1 victory,"It only took Connor McMichael five games with the Hershey Bears to register his first professional hat trick scoring all of the Bears’ goals on Saturday afternoon to lead Hershey to a 3-1 victory over Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.

The 19-year-old has impressed in his first four-game games with the Bears but number five was special. McMichael got on the board first cleaning up a rebound in front of Wilkes-Barre’s goalie Max Lagace on the power play to tie the game a 1-1.

“I felt pretty good tonight and then obviously scoring in the first period it helps you out a lot” said McMichael. “You just feel a lot more comfortable throughout the game and you just build off that. My line and our defense that I was out there with played really well and [Fucale] had a great game as well. It’s great to build up the first one and get a couple more.”

His second goal of the afternoon came on a breakaway going glove side on Lagace to give the Bears the lead at 2-1. “I saw that there was a little opening on the glove side and it took advantage of it.”

McMichael almost had the hat trick before the end of the second period scoring on a delayed penalty but having the play called dead by a whistle before the puck crossed the line. But he made up for it with a 120-foot empty-net goal to seal the victory for Hershey and his first professional hat trick.

“The puck follows him around” said head coach Spencer Carbery after the game. “Somehow someway he’s just in the right place right time and he sees the game that way. And that’s something as a coach – you can’t teach that.

“The thing I think we’re going to learn to appreciate about Connor is he is a very intelligent player. He is adapting on the fly to pro hockey and learning things. I’ve already had a couple conversations with him about small little things he has to start to do at the pro level he could get away with in the OHL and now are going to be essential to being successful not only in the NHL but in pro hockey in general.”

“I talk to Carbs basically every single day” said McMichael. “It’s just little things like in the D zone being more aggressive some faceoff work. The coaching staff and the guys have been great with me so far.”

Hershey Felder Presents Before Fiddler

Before the beloved musical Fiddler on the Roof there was Sholem Aleichem and his beloved character of “Tevye the Milkman.” Before the popularized songs “Tradition” “If I Were a Rich Man” “Matchmaker” and others there was music of the old world– a music that imitated talking laughing weeping and singing where musicians didn’t just make music they spoke to you in song through this music called Klezmer. In Florence Italy one of the oldest artistic centers in the world a group of musicians have been virtuosos in Florence’s world famous Maggio Musicale symphony by day and then become the Klezmerata Fiorentina by night. With Hershey Felder as their storyteller and their ancient European roots Felder executes a performance by taking on the role of great writer Sholem Aleichem himself – giving us the true story of what happened before Fiddler. Filmed on location where events actually took place this world premiere features stories and characters of Sholem Aleichem with a story and music that is sure to move your soul. The visual effects are outstanding as is the music.

HAL 9000 Anyone?,"Every time the words “artificial intelligence in space” are used together our minds cannot help from bringing back the memory of Arthur C. Clarke’s HAL 9000. Especially when they’re not used in some theoretical way but practically like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced it will do as of this weekend.

This Saturday February 20 a Northrop Grumman resupply mission to the International Space Station will carry with it HPE’s Spaceborne Computer-2 (SBC-2) the successor of a similar machine tested by the company on the space station in 2017 only twice as capable.HPE says that for the next two or three years the machine will help astronauts up there and scientists down here process the data they need for their experiments much faster than ever before at times cutting “time-to-insight from months to minutes.”This super-speed will be possible especially when it comes to processing medical imaging DNA sequencing and unlocking key insights from ""volumes of remote sensors and satellites"" says HPE. More importantly the computer will play a major part in providing communications’ assistance for the future crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.This is possible thanks to the way the computer was made. SBC-2 uses the HPE Edgeline Converged Edge system the HPE ProLiant server and powerful graphic processing units. It will also run Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service for an extra kick of power.HPE calls the SBC-2 the “first-ever in-space commercial edge computing and artificial intelligence capabilities” but does not go into the details of what AI means in this case.“We are honored to make edge computing in space possible and through our longstanding partnerships with NASA and the International Space Station U.S. National Laboratory we are looking forward to powering new exciting research opportunities to make breakthrough discoveries for humanity” said in a statement Dr. Mark Fernandez principal investigator for the Spaceborne Computer-2.For more info on the new hardware check out the press release section below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxtYXJ2YW5vdy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC92aXJnaW5pYS8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL25hc2Etd2FsbG9wcy1yb2NrZXQtbGF1bmNoLXdoYXRzLW9uLWJvYXJkLWN5Z251cy1oZWFkZWQtdG8taXNzLW5vcnRocnVwLWdydW1tYW4tYW50YXJlcy82NzIwMjMzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA Wallops rocket launch: What's on board Cygnus headed to ISS,"WALLOPS ISLAND Va.— A cold afternoon on Virginia's Eastern Shore was interrupted Saturday as Northrop Grumman's 15th commercial resupply mission tore through the sky above NASA Wallops.

Its largest audience was nowhere to be seen.

As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic closed the visitor center and field on Wallops Island most viewers watched from their computers as the Antares rocket hurled nearly 8200 pounds of cargo out of Earth's atmosphere.

At about 12:38 p.m. Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft was headed toward the International Space Station packed with scientific investigations technology demonstrations commercial products and other critical supplies.

Northrop Grumman named the 15th spacecraft after pioneering NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson also portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures"" for her role in making human spaceflight possible.

Though most viewers couldn't catch sight of the rocket in person — there's plenty to know about the 21-foot tall craft's payload before it reaches the ISS on Monday.

On its 15th journey Cygnus' thousands of pounds in cargo will include a Spaceborne Computer from Hewlett Packard Enterprise an experiment studying muscle strength in worms and an investigation into how microgravity might optimize the creation of artificial retinas.

""Right now there are hundreds of different experiments going on simultaneously on the International Space Station"" Heidi Parris associate program scientist for the International Space Station Program said during NASA's launch briefing.

""And it's putting into motion that work of some of the most brilliant scientific minds in the world.""

Worms get a microgravity workout

Loss of strength and muscle mass present a major challenge for astronauts on future long-stretched space voyages as NASA sees it. And more than 50 years after sending humans to the moon — the closest celestial body to Earth — the plan is still to head to Mars.

Mission to Mars:Explore the Perseverance rover in augmented reality

Who can help with that? Roundworms.

Coming ISS experiment ""Determining Muscle Strength in Space-flown Caenorhabditis elegans"" or Micro-16 will use these tiny worms to test whether decreased expression of muscle proteins is associated with a decrease in strength.

Micro-16 will use a new device developed by its research team to measure muscle strength in multiple generations of space-flown worms — and compare that strength to post-flight muscle gene expression.

Siva Vanapalli professor of chemical engineering at Texas Tech University says the worms only live about three weeks.

""As you all probably know on long-duration explorations a significant challenge is the astronaut health"" Vanapalli said in NASA's media briefing. ""The strength of the astronauts declines as they spend a significant amount of time on the ISS.""

He said his team has documented previous experiments where animals have shown significant changes in gene expression; however ""we don't know if those changes in genes actually translate to any changes in strength"" he said.

Vanapalli noted that outside the effects of space flight significant diseases in the United States also are marked by the impairment of muscles.

""So if we do observe that our device is able to record these changes in strength"" he continued ""then it opens up tremendous opportunities in conducting experiments on different drugs and figuring out how to maintain and improve the health of astronauts.""

Sharpening the space computer

Think of 2015 Matt Damon in ""The Martian.""

Mark Fernandez solutions architect for Converged Edge Systems at HP Enterprise spent a moment of NASA's briefing recalling the blockbuster movie.

""I saw that Matt Damon was sitting in the red dust of the Mars planet and it took 24 minutes of communication delay for him to get information back to Earth"" said the principal investigator of Spaceborne Computer-2. ""And then once they solved his problem it took 24 minutes to get back and he literally jumped up and was celebrating at almost an hour later when he got his answers.

""Well when we get to the moon and we get to Mars we're going to want to take our modern computers with us.""

MOON TRAVEL:NASA announces group of astronauts going to moon

Spaceborne Computer-2 hopes to build on the success of its first computer sent to ISS — to now explore how commercial off-the-shelf computer systems can advance exploration by processing data faster in space with edge computing and artificial intelligence capabilities.

""We want to propose to the community: Do you have an experiment where the time it takes you to get your data back to Earth and then process it here is it shorter than the time it will take to process the data on Spaceborne Computer-2 at the edge of the edge on the ISS?"" he asked. ""That's what we want to do.""

This special computer research could prove useful for advancing AI or machine learning anywhere Fernandez said — whether that's on an oil rig or in a drone surveying crops trees and cities.

""As we advance improve on the ability to compute ... and then deliver those insights back to the scientists that need them in their offices and at home"" he said ""then that improves the aspect for all of humanity.""

Seeing into the great beyond

Millions of people are blinded by end-stage retinal degenerative diseases like retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration.

Current treatments can only slow the progression.

When individuals have these conditions they lose the light-sensing cells of the eye — the rods and cones — and their eyes become insensitive to light. Thus they can no longer take light in the room and convert it into a signal that can be sent to the optic nerve and then to the brain.

LambdaVision a startup company developing a protein-based artificial retina to restore vision for these patients soon will see its second experiment sent aboard the ISS.

""LambdaVision's technology is a small simple flexible implant which will be placed in the back of the eye through a simple surgical procedure something very similar to a retinal detachment procedure"" said Nicole Wagner its president and CEO. ""The goal is to replace the function of the damaged rods and cones of the eyes and our artificial retinas will provide high-resolution vision to these patients.""

This second experiment is set to study the advantages of manufacturing artificial retinas in space — setting multiple layers of scaffold polymer and proteins. The structures will then come back to be studied further.

Assembly of these artificial retinas benefits from the microgravity environment during a layer-by-layer manufacturing approach.

The ""Protein-Based Artificial Retina Manufacturing"" experiment evaluates a manufacturing system using bacteriorhodopsin — the light-activated protein responsible for the activity of the artificial retina replacing the damaged photoreceptor cells in the eye.

""Now this is really important because what we're doing in terms of these processes and procedures will be critical for anything that needs to be manufactured that will have clinical applications to people here on Earth"" Wagner said.

Wagner said her company hopes to near its clinic stage within the next three to four years. Similar work flew on SpaceX CRS-16 in 2018 and this aims to build on those results.

""Just very thrilled to have a chance to establish a foundation for producing products in low-Earth orbit with true clinical benefits for patients"" said Jordan Greco chief scientific officer of LambdaVision. ""And in our case for patients that are blinded by this devastating retinal degenerative diseases.""

For now these experiments and all cargo aboard the S.S. Katherine Johnson can expect to connect with the ISS on Monday Feb. 22. — then Cygnus will later take its safe destructive reentry into Earth's Atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbW1hbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1jeWdudXMtbmcxNS1jYXJnby1zaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman Antares rocket launches Cygnus cargo ship to space station for NASA,"WALLOPS ISLAND Va. — A Northrop Grumman-built Cygnus cargo ship lifted off from Virginia on Saturday (Feb. 20) carrying vital supplies for astronauts on the International Space Station.

Perched atop a two-stage Antares rocket the uncrewed Cygnus NG-15 spacecraft blasted off from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility here at 12:36 p.m. EDT (1736 GMT).

The craft is hauling more than 8200 lbs. (3719 kilograms) of cargo that include scientific equipment fresh food and supplies for the seven astronauts on board the space station. It's also packed with new hardware and spacewalk equipment.

The 139-foot-tall (42.5-meter) Antares rocket lifted off right on time at the beginning of a planned 5-minute window. It's Cygnus NG-15 cargo ship is named after Katherine Johnson  the trailblazing NASA mathematician who helped make John Glenn's historic orbital flight — the first by an American astronaut — possible. Now 59 years later the S.S. Katherine Johnson embarks on her own flight to space on the 59th anniversary of Glenn's Friendship 7 Mercury flight.

Shortly after the payload fairing jettisoned leaving the Cygnus exposed to space. Powered by a solid-fueled upper stage the Cygnus was deposited in its preliminary orbit and ready to begin its journey to the space station. The cargo craft will spend two days chasing down the orbital outpost before berthing to the station with the help of a robotic arm.

Astronaut Soichi Noguchi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency will capture the vessel on Monday (Feb. 22) at about 4:40 a.m. EST (0940 GMT) with NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins serving as backup. The craft will remain at the station for approximately three months after which it will detach itself and burn up upon reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.

Hidden figures

Northrop Grumman makes both the Antares rocket and the Cygnus spacecraft. The company has a tradition of naming its spacecraft after fallen heroes who have made a significant contribution to human spaceflight.

In this case the company is choosing to honor the late Katherine Johnson who died at the age of 101 nearly a year ago on Feb. 24 2020. Johnson worked as a human computer whose trajectory calculations were critical to NASA's early success with human spaceflight in particular Glenn's orbital flight.

“It’s our tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who’s played a pivotal role in human spaceflight and Mrs. Johnson was selected for her hand-written calculations that helped launch the first Americans into space as well as her accomplishments in breaking glass ceiling after glass ceiling as a Black woman” said Frank DeMauro vice president and general manager for tactical space at Northrop Grumman said on Friday (Feb. 19).

Years after her retirement Johnson's work was highlighted in the book "" Hidden Figures "" and later the movie of the same name starring Taraji P. Hensen as Johnson. Johnson received a congressional medal of freedom and the congressional gold medal from President Barack Obama for her work at NASA.

Special delivery

Tucked inside the Cygnus is a bevy of time-sensitive cargo items including a supply of fresh food for the astronauts on the space station. During a prelaunch briefing on Friday NASA officials said they were sending up some treats for the crew members of Expedition 64 including salmon hard salami parmesan cheese caramel hard candies and other perishable items.

""We want to keep the crew happy because a happy crew is a productive crew for science"" David Brady associate program scientist for the International Space Station said prior to launch.

Also inside the Cygnus is a brine processor assembly for the space station's water recycling system which converts urine into fresh drinking water . NASA says the new processor will enable more water to be recovered from urine than with the current equipment on station. The agency says this is a key piece of hardware to help meet the requirements for future long-duration missions to the moon and eventually Mars.

""Long-duration crewed exploration missions require about 98% water recovery and there is currently no state-of- the-art technology in brine processing that can help achieve this goal"" NASA officials wrote in a fact sheet . ""This brine processor system plans to close this gap for the urine waste stream of the space station.""

The equipment works by using special membranes to separate contaminants from the brine allowing water vapor to flow into the cabin atmosphere where a condenser will capture it and filter it into the station's water system.

Also onboard the Cygnus will be a new sleeping pod for the Expedition 64 crew. Currently there are five astronauts in the U.S. segment — four Crew-1 astronauts who launched in November on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon and Kate Rubins who flew on a Soyuz last October — with only four sleep stations. Hopkins the Crew Dragon commander has been sleeping in the capsule since launching in November. Three Russian cosmonauts round out the station's crew.

Cygnus also is ferrying spare parts and equipment for the space station's toilets and equipment for upcoming spacewalks.

Weird science

The bevy of research experiments brought up on the NG-15 mission will researchers to better understand how microgravity affects the human body as well as manufacturing processes. One investigation will look at the construction of protein-based artificial retinas on station.

Designed by LambdaVision the experiment will use a layer-by-layer process to manufacture artificial retinas in space. The hope is that the ""retina"" can then be implanted into the eye of a patient suffering from degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration.

One high-tech experiment aboard is the Spaceborne Computer-2  a collaboration by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Microsoft to bring cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology to the International Space Station. Microsoft will link its Azure Space Platform to the computer to ""deliver edge computing and [artificial intelligence] capabilities'' to the station according to HPE.

Another experiment will measure muscle strength in multiple generations of worms to better understand the biological changes that happen during spaceflight. Led by Siva Vanapalli the experiment will look at how the muscle strength in worms changes overtime during spaceflight.

About 1000 worm larvae are en route to the space station tucked inside the Cygnus as part of the Micro-16 investigation. Once on station the worms will produce many offspring during their trip allowing researchers to look at multiple generations. They're also sending a device called NemaFlex which is designed to measure how much force the worms exert.

Vanapalli is hoping that the device will enable the team to measure changes in the worm's strength which can be beneficial to drug development as well as help researchers improve astronaut health.

Also on board the Cygnus are several student experiments including the Magnitude.io experiment that will help engage students in STEM projects with the help of bitmoji stickers. The experiment called ExoLab 8  is Magnitude.io's eighth investigation sent to the space station.

Mission participants (which will include students from Kindergarten through college level) will attempt to grow red clover plants at home and in their classrooms to act as a ground control experiment and compare growth rates to similar plants grown in space.

Online activities will be led by an Astro_moji teacher — Linwood Elementary Technology teacher Lisa Turney. Her likeness will be turned into a bitmoji who will teach students from space via her bitmoji avatar. The experiment will rely on a SpaceTango CubeLab that will facilitate plant growth.

""We are taking distance learning to a whole new level: 250 miles above the Earth to an orbital classroom"" Magnitude.io CEO Ted Tagami wrote in a news release . ""While the pandemic disrupted many learning experiences our mission participants will remember 2021 as the year they went to space.""

Like the only Palmetto State property that already graced the list the new addition is a high-end resort located just outside a larger beach destination.

Bluffton's Montage Palmetto Bluff resort describes itself as being ""nestled"" between Hilton Head Island and Savannah. It's the first lodging in the Hilton Head area to get a five-star nod from Forbes.

In its listing in the Forbes Travel Guide the riverfront resort is described as an ""idyllic Lowcountry hideaway"" surrounded by nature.

The sole Forbes Five-Star hotel in South Carolina prior to last week's award rollout was The Sanctuary at Kiawah Island Golf Resort.

Other destinations that logged their inaugural five-star hotel rating included Houston for the Post Oak Hotel and Philadelphia and Seattle for their Four Seasons hotels.

At 20 California was the state with the highest number of five-star hotels followed by New York with 11 and Florida with eight. Nationwide there are only 87 hotels with that distinction.

Palmetto Bluff is now one of a handful of properties managed by California-based Montage Hotels & Resorts with a five-star hotel award. The others are in Park City Utah; Orange County Calif.; Maui and Los Cabos Mexico.

Montage unveiled its $100 million expansion of the Lowcountry resort in 2016 which included a new 74-room inn and a 13000-square-foot spa which has its own Forbes rating of four stars.

Summerville's historic Woodlands Mansion was the first lodging in South Carolina to get a five-star rating from Forbes but The Sanctuary at Kiawah Island has in recent years been the solitary property in the state at the five-star level.

We measure them by comparisons to buses herds of elephants and dinosaurs. So it might surprise you to learn that there are some whales which get totally different descriptions – like the ‘pygmy blue whales’ which make the Indian Ocean home.

Pygmy blue whales are a tropical subspecies of the blue whale and though they are only a few metres shorter in length reaching about 24m as opposed to the 30m they are often about half of the overall weight of a blue whale in the Antarctic.

Many subspecies of whales have only been discovered relatively recently. So many whales especially larger ones like blue whales were annihilated by commercial whaling in the 19th and 20th centuries that we are only now understanding the full impacts for local populations species and the oceans as a whole. Only when whaling countries came together to form the International Whaling Commission in 1946 we began to understand just how many whales were being hunted. Even then there was disagreement on how species were recorded. Current science is showing us how much we still don’t know about the world’s whales – from their breeding habits to their communications and culture – and the discovery of new subspecies and species is still happening.

But why does that matter? Well when we realise that what had once seemed to be a single whale species (or any other animal) is actually made up of separate populations or subspecies they are at more risk than if they were one big population. Local availability of feeding and breeding grounds and any human disturbance is important because they are more specialised and limited in range.

Globally industrial-scale commercial whaling reduced the number of blue whales to an estimated ONE percent of their previous numbers. We may already have lost some subspecies or distinct populations forever without even realising.

For example Indian Ocean pygmy blue whales are not the same as their Antarctic cousins. They face increasing threats from the industrialisation of our oceans with ocean noise ship strikes and habitat destruction being big dangers to their ongoing survival as well as the global threat from climate change.

Yet at the same time we know these animals are not only incredible in their own right but also heroes in tackling climate change and keeping our wider oceans healthy and full of life.

These big ‘little’ whales have a huge role to play in the ecosystem and the only way to secure their future now is to properly protect their ocean home. For long-living far-travelled animals that means making sure that large areas of ocean are set aside as ocean sanctuaries – protecting vital feeding and breeding grounds and also giving them space to live and thrive.

In 1986—thanks to an overwhelming amount of public support—commercial whaling was banned worldwide. Now global cooperation is urgent again – to create a network of ocean sanctuaries to protect whales and their home. The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is sailing the Indian Ocean to document the threats our oceans face and to put pressure on governments to protect them. Join 3.5 million people worldwide and add your name to call for the protection of whales and the oceans they call home."

Blackouts left many unable to heat their homes cook meals work remotely or even sleep

Five days in Texas as millions went without power amid a record cold snap

After five bone-chilling days Texas is at last warming up.

As of Saturday morning aid is en route and sunshine is dawning on the devastated Lone Star State.

And Americans are learning the scale of the havoc caused by the winter storms that ravaged the center of the country earlier this week.

At the height of the record-shattering cold snap millions were without power. Even as temperatures rise many don’t have access to drinking water while some grocery stores’ shelves remain bare.

In a week winter weather wreaked billions of dollars worth of damage on infrastructure stirred political scandal for Texas’s junior senator and claimed dozens of lives in at least seven states.

As heavy snow and freezing rain pummeled the central United States more than 4 million households lost power Monday with many outages tied to record-high demand. In Texas the state’s electricity grid which is independent from surrounding states was unable to withstand the storm and strain.

The blackouts left many unable to heat their homes cook meals work remotely — or sleep at night.

Synthetic chemicals called phthalates are damaging children’s brain development and therefore must be immediately banned from consumer products according to a group of scientists and health professionals from Project TENDR.

Project TENDR which stands for Targeting Environmental Neuro-Development Risks is a group of volunteer scientists health professionals and child advocates working to study and reduce children’s exposure to neurotoxic chemicals and pollutants.

“What we want to accomplish is to move the public health community including regulators toward this goal of elimination of phthalates” said lead author Stephanie Engel.

“We have enough evidence right now to be concerned about the impact of these chemicals on a child’s risk of attention learning and behavioral disorders” said Engel a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health.

“I hope that this paper will act as a wake-up call to understand that early life exposure to this class of chemicals is affecting our children” said toxicologist Linda Birnbaum former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences as well as the National Toxicology Program. She was not involved in the paper.

“When you have the same kind of findings repeated in multiple populations done by different investigators using different tools and approaches and you keep coming up with the same finding I think you can begin to say that the data is pretty clear” Birnbaum said.

CNN reached out for comment from the trade association American Chemistry Council.

“While we are encouraged by continuous research efforts into the science and health of phthalates we are concerned about the over interpretation of studies that have not established a causal link between phthalates and human adverse health effects” said Eileen Conneely senior director of the chemical products and technology division of ACC.

‘Everywhere chemicals’

Called “everywhere chemicals” because they are so common phthalates are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break.

Phthalates are found in hundreds of auto home food and personal care items: food packaging; detergents; vinyl flooring clothing furniture and shower curtains; automotive plastics; lubricating oils and adhesives; rain and stain-resistant products; and scores of products including shampoo soap hair spray and nail polish in which they make fragrances last longer.

Phthalates must be listed among the ingredients on product labels unless they are added as a part of the scent. Under current US Food and Drug Administration regulations phthalates can be simply labeled “fragrance” even though they could be as much as 20% of the product studies say.

Phthalates are also in PVC plumbing and building products and items such as medical tubing garden hoses and some children’s toys. Globally approximately 8.4 million metric tonnes of phlathates and other plasticizers are consumed annually according to European Plasticizers an industry trade association.

Studies have connected phthalates to childhood obesity asthma cardiovascular issues cancer and reproductive problems such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and low sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males.

Neurotoxins

The new call to action published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health focuses specifically on the link between phthalate exposure and long-lasting neurodevelopmental harm in fetuses infants and children.

By 2019 more than 30 studies had examined prenatal exposure to different types of phthalates and long-term studies had been done in 11 different countries or territories around the globe the report said. Not all of the papers had found consistent results especially in the area of cognitive development but the report’s authors said that might be due to difference in study designs and children’s ages.

The report said the strongest associations have been found with hyperactivity aggression defiance emotional reactivity delinquent behaviors and other signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD after exposure to phthalates.

One study for example found children of mothers with the highest levels of phthalates in their urine during their second trimester had almost three times the odds of being diagnosed with ADHD as children with mothers who had much lower levels.

A link between phthalate exposure and poorer working memory and intelligence has also been found. One study discovered children who were exposed to higher levels of phthalates in utero had an IQ level that was seven points lower than children with less exposure. The highest-risk kids also had reduced perceptual reasoning and verbal comprehension.

Conneely of the ACC however pointed to recent systematic reviews that pulled together available data on neurobehavioral and cognition effects and “concluded that there was no association between DINP and DIDP and neurobehavioral or cognitive effects.”

Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP) are two of the many types of chemicals in the family of phthalates.

In addition Conneely said “data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clearly show exposure levels to phthalates are well below the levels determined by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory bodies to be safe.”

It’s true that “federal regulation of phthalates in the United States has been minimal with several exceptions including restrictions on 8 phthalates in children’s toys and childcare articles” the study said.

However the study continued “we strongly urge both federal and state agencies to move rapidly to eliminate phthalate use” adding that “states should not wait for the federal government to act as state action can galvanize federal regulation.”

In response to CNN’s request an EPA spokesperson provided the following comment.

“As the Biden-Harris Administration works to advance EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment the agency is committed to ensuring the safety of chemicals used by all Americans.

“The agency is actively working to ensure all (Toxic Substances Control Act) chemical risk evaluations including the ongoing evaluations for seven phthalates follow the science and the law and that any resulting risk management actions protect human health particularly the health of more vulnerable groups like children and workers and the environment.”

Timing of exposure

Unlike toxic metals such as lead arsenic cadmium and mercury phthalates are more rapidly metabolized and typically leave the body once exposure is removed.

“They have much shorter biological half lives than say the heavy metals which can hang around for decades” said David Bellinger a professor of neurology and psychology at Boston Children’s Hospital and a member of Project TENDR who was not involved in the new paper.

The problem Bellinger added is that once the baby’s developing brain is impacted by the chemical in utero the damage has been done.

“The brain might be exposed at just the wrong time” Bellinger said. “That’s the concern.”

Critics argue that studies showing distinct neurodevelopmental harm have only been done in animals while studies on young children focus on behavioral impacts such as increases in behavioral disorders and attention and learning deficits.

“There will never be gold-standard randomized clinical trials” said Birnbaum because science would never deliberately expose a child to such chemicals. That’s the whole issue with environmental exposures.”

Elimination is the goal

The paper called for the elimination of the entire class of phthalates from products that lead to the exposure of pregnant women women of reproductive age infants and children.

Banning them one-by-one won’t adequately lessen the threat Engel said.

“We’re exposed to multiple phthalates and that mixture can come within a single product but also across multiple products that people are exposed to in a day” Engel said. “The reality is that we need to think of phthalates as a class because that’s how people are exposed to them.”

Another reason that the entire class of phthalates should be regulated BIrnbaum said is to keep manufacturers from replacing one “bad actor” with another phthalate that hasn’t been as thoroughly studied.

“This is the whole history of these chemicals” Birnbaum said “whether you call it ‘whack a mole’ or ‘chemical conveyor belt’ or ‘unfortunate substitution.’ We move from one chemical that we have concerns about to another one which we just haven’t studied yet which often turns out to be just as problematic.

“We can’t continue to test these things one at a time” Birnbaum continued. “I could make an argument that if one chemical can be substituted for another without changing the process then why would you think the biology would be different?”

Critics point to the expense of removing an entire class of chemicals from the marketplace.

“Cost is always the counter argument to change” Engel told CNN. “But the current system has costs too. It’s just that we’ve become accustomed to paying them. Right now families health care school systems are shouldering the costs of a lack of health protective regulation for children.”

Engel also argues that elimination of the entire class of chemicals is possible “because manufacturers are already showing us that it’s feasible” and points to a number of actions already taken by the marketplace. Apple the paper said has removed “phthalates as a class from almost all products” while other companies like CVS and The Home Depot have reduced the use of phthalates in beauty personal care products household products and vinyl flooring.

And of course the public can play a significant role in accomplishing change. Boston Children’s Bellinger pointed to the success of angry moms who demanded that companies remove the hormone disruptor Bisphenol A commonly known as BPA from baby bottles and sippy cups.

In reaction to the public uproar six of the major baby bottle manufacturers announced the removal of BPA from their products in March 2009 three years before the FDA banned the chemical from those products at the request of the American Chemistry Council an industry trade group.

“If people just vote with their wallets and let these companies know that they care that’s probably an effective a way to shake this thing loose” Bellinger said.

Other petitions awaiting action

This isn’t the first group to call upon the FDA to consider an entire class of chemicals and their overall impact.

A petition submitted last year by the Environmental Defense Fund and other advocates called upon the FDA to consider the “cumulative effects” of the more than 10000 chemicals allowed to be added to foods and food packaging. Some of those like phthalates and another class of chemicals called PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are known hormone disruptors linked to developmental cognitive and other health problems in babies and adults.

CNN reached out for comment from the FDA on the new study. The agency said it was aware of the study publication and was reviewing the findings.

The FDA spokesperson added that “currently the FDA is reviewing two food additive petitions proposing the agency amend our food additive regulations by removing authorizations for the use of ortho-phthalates in food-contact applications. Completing our review of these petitions and publishing our response in the Federal Register is a priority for the FDA.”

The movement toward elimination is heading mainstream as more and more medical associations begin to question the lasting impacts of plastic additives. Last year’s petition for example is supported by 11 groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics the American Public Health Association and the Center for Food Safety.

Not only is it time that regulators take definitive action to address these ubiquitous chemicals in our environment Birnhaum said consumers also should be voting with their pocketbooks.

“We need to step back and ask the question ‘What do we really need when we know there is a downside?’ Do we really need every tablecloth or new carpet to be totally stain repellent?’” she said.

“Or maybe when we go out to dinner we carry a glass container in our pocketbook as a doggie bag instead of coming home with a Styrofoam or coated paper container” Birnhaum continued.

“We have to say ‘What’s the purpose what’s the function that we’re looking to do?’ And let’s find a way to do it safely from the beginning.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25oZXJhbGQvbmFtZS9yb2dlci1tb3JnYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzA2MTg0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Morgan Obituary (1934 - 2021) - Boston MA - Boston Herald,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonherald/name/roger-morgan-obituary?id=7061849 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25oZXJhbGQvbmFtZS9yb2dlci1tb3JnYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NzA2MTg0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWhpLW1vbS1kZXRlY3RpdmUtY2hpbmF0b3duLTMtYm90aC1zb2FyLXBhc3QtNjAwbS00MTM2MTAxL9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvY2hpbmEtYm94LW9mZmljZS1oaS1tb20tZGV0ZWN0aXZlLWNoaW5hdG93bi0zLWJvdGgtc29hci1wYXN0LTYwMG0tNDEzNjEwMS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Box Office: ‘Hi Mom’ ‘Detective Chinatown 3’ Both Soar Past $600M,"Chinese blockbusters Hi Mom and Detective Chinatown 3 both sailed past the $600 million mark during their second weekend in cinemas — an unprecedented feat for two films competing head-to-head in a single market.

Heartwarming comedy Hi Mom produced by Beijing Culture has emerged as China‘s 2021 Lunar New Year champion despite beginning the holiday in distant second behind Wanda Pictures’ comedy franchise hit Detective Chinatown 3. Although DC3 had powerful franchise appeal and vastly more marketing buzz going into the holiday Hi Mom captured the hearts of Chinese moviegoers and became a viral phenomenon consistently generating the highest social scores on ticketing apps and movie reviews sites.

Hi Mom won the second weekend with sales totaling $134.2 million a 17 percent decline from its opening three days when DC3 was dominating screen share. DC3 added $45.3 million this past weekend an 89 percent slide from its record-breaking opening of $397.2 million. Ten days into release Hi Mom‘s cumulative total is $619.4 million a squeak more than DC3 with $619.2 million according to estimates from regional box-office tracker Artisan Gateway.

In Imax DC3 reached $33 million becoming the third highest-grossing local-language title ever in the giant screen format.

Directed written by and starring Chinese comedy veteran Jia Ling Hi Mom tells the story of a woman whose world is turned upside-down by the death of her mother. Grief stricken she magically transports back in time to meet a younger version of her mom attempting to improve her mom’s life using insights from the future. The film is based on memories of Jia’s real-life mother who passed away in the director’s teenage years.

In third place during the second weekend of the holiday was Huace’s fantasy action film A Writer’s Odyssey which earned a further $20.2 million to lift its cume to $112 million. Andy Lau’s well-reviewed thriller Endgame climbed to fourth place with $14.7 million for a $42.3 million running total. Scoring fifth was kids animation installment Bonnie Bears: The Wild Life with $10 million and $77.4 million in total.

Lightchaser Animation’s New Gods: Nezha Reborn which recently was acquired by Netflix added about $9 million for a $50.3 million total. Huayi Brother’s fantasy feature fell to a distant seventh place with just $2.6 million and $36.7 million in total.

The Chinese New Year period officially comes to a close on Friday — and with the end of the enormously lucrative holiday window regulators will lift their protectionist blackout on Hollywood film releases. The first studio title to test the waters of China’s again-booming theatrical market will be Warner Bros.’ live-action/animation hybrid Tom and Jerry opening Friday Feb. 26."

Pat Thornburgh purchasing manager; Sue Hamilton industrial engineer clerk; Mark Hamilton warehouse operator; Carol Tull warehouse operator; and Brenda Byers mechanical storeroom team member; have been at the Osceola Food plant since day one.

What today is known as Osceola Food LLC has been a part of the town’s history since 1972 when it was originally built for the Jimmy Dean Meat Company. Hormel Foods began production at the facility in 1996 having purchased it the year before. The facility is more than triple the size of its original footprint and covers more than 360000 square feet. Osceola Food employs more than 900 team members and runs 24/7 continuous operations producing a variety of products for foodservice and retail consumers.

These five inspired team members have stayed because Hormel Foods has taken care of them and their families they say. When Byers was looking for work in 1996 she realized Hormel Foods offered great benefits and saw the opportunity as a great way to better herself. One of Thornburgh’s favorite memories was an ice cream party for a co-worker who had just returned after going through cancer treatments.

“It’s hard to believe that we have all been here since the beginning” said Thornburgh. “We have become a tight-knit family.”

Tull lives over the border in Missouri and gets up at 2:30 a.m. to be ready to work at 5:30 a.m. She recalled driving down her drivewaythrough snowdrifts and keeping a close eye out for deer. The drive can be tough in the winter but while the group was chatting about her long drive Sue Hamilton shared “We’d be lost without” and Tull replied “I’d be lost without this place.”

“I wouldn’t be anywhere else. They feel like my family my second family” Sue Hamilton said. Before working for Osceola Food she and her husband Mark drove four hours roundtrip to work in Des Moines Iowa. Working at Osceola Food allowed the Hamiltons to spend more time with their family something they both consider to be a blessing. “It’s hard to believe it has been 25 years” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNuYWNrYW5kYmFrZXJ5LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy85NjI5My1ob3JtZWwtZm9vZHMtcHJldHplbC1iaXRlcy13aXRoLWNoZWVzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hormel Foods Pretzel Bites with Cheese | 2021-02-21,"Company: Hormel Foods

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Idle power consumption on 120V power we saw around 12W idle. We generally assume these nodes will use 9-12W idle so this was directly in the range we would expect. Again we do see power consumption creep slightly higher over time if dust accumulates in the fan/ heatsink and we did have some accumulation which we mostly cleaned.

The power supply for this unit is a 65W HP power adapter from the company’s notebook line. As you would expect you can use the adapters from the company’s notebooks on this 800 G3 Mini. We could push the system to around 51W so there is room to spare. In newer systems having all USB 3 Gen1/Gen2 ports can drive power supply needs higher than the 65W level that we commonly saw in this generation from HP Dell and Lenovo.

At idle the system is not silent but it is very quiet if working from 1M away. It stays fairly quiet under light loads but if you run heavy CPU/ GPU workloads the fans spin up and it certainly gets louder.

Next we are going to discuss key lessons learned before getting to our final thoughts.

Key Lesson Learned for TMM

In this series we wanted to also focus on some key lessons learned. Since we have already tested well over a dozen different models we are taking away key pieces of advice from each that we wanted to share.

The reason we picked an Intel Core i5-7500T SKU for this platform is that it launched at a strange time for these units. The Core i5-7500T was a very incremental upgrade over the Core i5-6500T. From 2015 to 2017 we got a 200MHz bump. From 2017 to 2018 we got two additional cores at this $192 price level. Our key takeaway is that there are limited cases where we would spend a lot more to purchase a Core i5-7500T over a Core i5-6500T however the secondary market often values the Core i5-7500T much higher. In contrast the Core i5-7500T system pricing often is much closer to the Core i5-8500T pricing which is why we would generally move up to the post-Ryzen generation and get 50% more compute resources.

Now that we have covered around two dozen systems in our review sample I wanted to address the scale-up v. scale-out question. When we were comparing this unit pricing to new pricing on HP’s website this was less than a third of what a new system would cost.

What was interesting is that the best price for a similar HP and Lenovo/ Dell configuration generally had HP’s pricing well above Lenovo and Dell’s pricing on similar units. We are just using the upcoming Lenovo ThinkCentre M75q-2 Tiny Gen 2 versus the HP EliteDesk 805 G6 Mini here. These machines have 8 core / 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 Pro CPUs as well as a warranty. The impact there is that we get twice the core count four times the thread count and updated features such as WiFi 6 GPUs and USB 3.2 Gen2 support with the newer models.

If we are simply focused on scaling up Project TinyMiniMicro nodes the competition we have seen is rapidly driving core counts which means that there are many cases where one can simply add more RAM and SSD space to a newer system and consolidate 2:1 or 3:1 versus older TinyMiniMicro nodes.

The Project TinyMiniMicro concept was to show scale-out where the number of nodes is important. We know many readers look to scale-up nodes so it is worth looking to newer models and asking the question if one is better off with a newer larger node versus multiple smaller nodes.

Final Words

Overall this system performed well for what it is and was in-line with the Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q Tiny yet with vPro support that the Lenovo unit did not have.

At the same time there were a few items that would give us pause recommending the system in the secondary market. First HP was considerably far behind Lenovo in this era of serviceability. This is HP’s top-end unit while the M710q is a lower-end segment machine. Yet one can see for example that the Lenovo M710q Tiny (below) has a 2.5″ carrier that can be removed without tools and the 2.5″ drive does not need tools to be installed in the carrier. The M.2 and memory are underneath the back panel and can be installed without tools. As an example to service the M.2 SSD for Lenovo one simply needs to pop off the top and bottom covers then install the drive using the blue tab retention. For the HP EliteDesk 800 G3 Mini one needs to remove the 2.5″ SSD (if present) undo three Torx screws to remove the 2.5″ carrier potentially remove the 2.5″ SATA data/ power cable then one can get to the M.2 SSD which is another Philip’s head screw. One complete these processes need to be reversed. It is an amazingly stark difference from a similar generation albeit technically this is a “lower-end” Lenovo unit than we are looking at from HP.

We should mention that one can purchase this unit with the Core i5-6500T and those units tend to sell for less. Our sense is that those may be a better value. While this unit worked well for us we now have the context of working through so many systems at different portfolio levels and across generations and vendors that we can say the HP EliteDesk 800 G3 Mini is perhaps not our favorite but it is still a good machine. We just would not pay a significant premium for this unit.

We're not talking about something official here just the engine swap everybody wants in their Jeep a Hellcat. Or better yet let's make it a Demon.

This week AutotopiaLA took a breather from checking out the best muscle cars in the country to check out the ""panty dropper"" a Gladiator with way too much power. This custom truck is a sinister-looking build with immaculate black paint and some serious suspension work.As attention-grabbing as those 40-inch tires are we've seen plenty of Jeep rolling on those in the past. But Dodge V8 swaps are pretty rare. This one is built by a specialist company and comes with the more radical Demon setup so it's making about 850 horsepower. Its owner says that it might be illegal to drive in California as with the custom exhaust it's got going on the setup won't pass smog.However we do get a short sample of what it's like on the road and the experience is dominated by the whine of the 2.7-liter supercharger which kicks into action almost from idle. It's got an 8-speed automatic gearbox a heavy-duty Griffin radiator for the engine and an air-to-water intercooler for the supercharger so it's quite the civilized setup.The owner mentions how the bumpers are stock even though this looks fully custom and that's because this was a Gladiator Launch Edition. However there's nothing stock about the pickup's massive 6.5-inch Enforcer Overland Stage-4 suspension or the Demon logs embroidered into the seats.And what does a thing like this cost? The video doesn't say but we remember the actual Barrett Jackson listing  as it went for $198000. This might seem like a lot of money and power but a 1000 horsepower Gladiator from Hennessey starts from about $225000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtMTAwMC1ocC1hdWRpLXJzMy1kYXJlcy10by1iZS1ncmVhdC1ieS1jaGFsbGVuZ2luZy1ndC1ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This 1000-HP Audi RS3 Dares To Be Great By Challenging GT-Rs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtMTAwMC1ocC1hdWRpLXJzMy1kYXJlcy10by1iZS1ncmVhdC1ieS1jaGFsbGVuZ2luZy1ndC1ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjEtcG9yc2NoZS05MTEtdHVyYm8tY2FicmlvbGV0LWlzLWFic3VyZGx5LWZhc3QtYW5kLXF1aXRlLWx1eHVyaW91cy1zYXktdGhlc21va2luZ3RpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet Is Absurdly Fast And Quite Luxurious Say TheSmokingTire,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tLzIwMjEtcG9yc2NoZS05MTEtdHVyYm8tY2FicmlvbGV0LWlzLWFic3VyZGx5LWZhc3QtYW5kLXF1aXRlLWx1eHVyaW91cy1zYXktdGhlc21va2luZ3RpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Renewable energy remains red-hot even after a scorching 2020 where renewables trounced the broader market's gains. From small pure-play wind and solar stocks to large companies looking to diversify their revenue mix now seems to be a great time to look for premium renewable energy stocks. But there's a problem. Many of the industry's leading companies are now trading near record highs -- which can be off-putting for investors looking for a lower entry point.

With that we asked some of our contributors which renewable energy stocks they thought were cheap now. They came up with American Electric Power (AEP 1.19%) Dominion Energy (D 1.38%) and Hubbell (HUBB 1.30%).

Power your portfolio with a utility player

Scott Levine (American Electric Power): While politicians debate the role that green energy has played in the Texas power outages smart investors recognize that the political wrangling doesn't detract from the fact that renewable energy stocks represent significant growth opportunities. The challenge for clean-energy-minded investors though is where to turn. Although solar wind and geothermal stocks all represent viable options from which investors can choose American Electric Power (AEP) provides a less obvious approach. And fortunately for investors they can currently find shares in the bargain bin.

Branding itself as ""the premier regulated energy company"" AEP has a presence in 11 states and provides electricity to about 5.5 million customers making it one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States. Management has articulated a clear commitment to environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) values. For example the company is targeting a 42% reduction in its coal capacity by 2030 and it plans on supplanting this in part with ample green energy additions. Over the next 10 years AEP expects to add 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power to its power portfolio and 4.2 GW of wind power.

Unlike the majority of renewable energy stocks that don't reward shareholders by way of a dividend AEP has demonstrated consistent interest in returning capital to investors. Over the past decade AEP -- currently offering investors an attractive 3.8% dividend yield on its stock -- has steadily raised its distribution and it seems intent on continuing that trend.

Management expects to return $2.96 per share to investors in 2021 -- about 4.2% more than it dished out in 2020. Allaying concerns that the company is jeopardizing its financial well-being to please investors with the dividend management has targeted a payout ratio of 60% to 70% -- a range that seems reasonable considering the company's average payout ratio over the past three years has been 62%.

Currently shares of AEP appear attractively priced from a couple of different angles. For one the stock is trading at 20.3 times earnings representing a discount to its five-year average multiple of 27.3. Similarly the stock is trading at 2.6 times sales. While this is slightly higher than its five-year average ratio of 2.4 the valuation is still reasonable considering the S&P 500 P/S ratio is 2.9.

Transitioning from natural gas to renewables

Daniel Foelber (Dominion Energy): Dominion energy is the latest utility stock to launch an aggressive push into renewable energy. The company is a leading energy provider in Utah Ohio Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina. Although Dominion's portfolio is still mostly fossil fuels it has done a good job of moving away from coal toward natural gas over the past 15 years. Its sale of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and other gas transmission and distribution assets to Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway last year marked the first major step in its push to transition away from gas and toward renewables.

That push accelerated further when the company reported fourth-quarter results. Bigger than the numbers themselves was the company's brand new $32 billion five-year capital spending program 52% of which is devoted toward zero-carbon through offshore wind solar energy storage and nuclear relicensing. Offshore wind in particular is a big catalyst for Dominion's growth led by the company's 2.6 GW megaproject that is expected to go into service in 2024.

Impressively enough Dominion is confident that even with the hefty spending plan it will be able to grow earnings per share by at least 6.5% over the next five years. This forecast should be fairly accurate considering 88% of Dominion's existing portfolio is state-regulated. The company also plans to grow its dividend at 6% over the long term. In an effort to fund its renewable aspirations Dominion cut its quarterly dividend from $0.94 per share to $0.63 in December of last year. Even with the cut Dominion yields an impressive 3.5% -- much higher than the current market average of 1.5%.

Given the company's strong existing portfolio aggressive and profitable renewable investments and the fact that shares are on sale for 20% less than a year ago Dominion looks to be a worthwhile renewable energy stock to buy now.

Renewable energy provides growth for Hubbell

Lee Samaha (Hubbell): The words ""cheap"" and ""renewable energy stock"" don't often fit together these days. Therefore if you are looking for a value option you will have to think outside the box or rather outside the sweep of a wind power turbine.

In this context what about buying a highly cash generative value stock with some exposure to renewable energy related spending? That's where electrical and electronic products company Hubbell comes into play. If you are going to have investment in renewable energy farms you are going to need investment in the transmission and distribution (T&D) network as well.

Hubbell's exposure comes through its utility solutions segment responsible for 57% of adjusted operating profit in 2020 with electrical solutions making up the rest. Commenting on the fourth-quarter performance on the earnings release CEO Gerben Bakker said ""In the fourth quarter utility facing markets remained resilient with grid modernization and renewable energy trends driving ongoing strength in demand for T&D components and mid single digit growth in Power Systems.""

Looking ahead management expects its utility T&D components end market to grow 2% to 4% and utility communications and controls to grow 4% to 6%. Coupled with a recovery in the electrical solutions end market management expects Hubbell's sales to grow 6% to 8% with organic sales up 3% to 5%. Management's guidance implies around $495 million in free cash flow (FCF) putting Hubbell on a forward price-to-FCF multiple of 18.5 times.

That's a good value particularly if growth in spending on utility T&D will support mid-single-digit revenue growth over the medium term.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stennis refueling overhaul,"The US Navy has awarded Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding division a $2.9 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74).

The RCOH represents 35% of all maintenance and modernization in an aircraft carrier’s 50-year service life.

Stennis’ RCOH will include the refueling of the ship’s reactors as well as extensive modernization work to more than 2300 compartments hundreds of tanks and systems. In addition major upgrades will be made in the propulsion plant to the flight deck catapults combat systems and the island.

“We are pleased to be awarded the contract to execute this extensive construction and engineering project” said Todd West Newport News’ vice president in-service aircraft carrier programs. “Our teams have spent three years preparing and planning for each step of the process along the way and we look forward to continuing our work with our suppliers and Navy partners in anticipation of the ship’s arrival at Newport News.”

Built at Newport News Stennis was christened in 1993 and delivered to the Navy in 1995. The ship is the seventh Nimitz-class carrier to undergo this major life-cycle milestone. Stennis should complete the overhaul by late 2025.

USS John C. Stennis arrived at Naval Station Norfolk where it will undergo the overhaul in May 2019 after completing a seven-month deployment to Europe Middle East and the Pacific. Once it completes the procedure the carrier will return to its original homeport in Bremerton Washington.",,,,,,,,,,,,

During Black History Month IBM is reflecting on the stories of many Black IBMers from those in our history to trailblazers today. We interviewed Dr. Lydia Campbell IBM’s vice president and chief medical officer who discusses her role leading the safety of more than 350000 employees across the globe what Black History Month means to her and the quest to pave a more inclusive and equitable workforce in tech.

Tell me a little about yourself.

I am the youngest of seven children. Although by the time I was born there were only two other siblings still living at home we were all very close. I grew up in Detroit Michigan in the 1970’s and 1980’s when times were getting better for Black people. After the riots and social unrest of the 1960’s many people of color were beginning to find stability and good jobs working in the booming automotive industry. I found myself looking into STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math).

Who or what inspired you to go into STEM?

For as long as I can remember I always wanted to be a doctor. The idea of helping people and solving problems appealed to me. My interest in STEM motivated me to leave for college one week after graduating from Cass Technical High School where I then joined the Spelman College Summer Science Program. In college I majored in natural science to prepare for my career as a doctor. This led me to attend Morehouse School of Medicine for my medical education and complete a dual residency training program in Internal Medicine and Occupational and Environmental Medicine. I also obtained a Master of Public Health degree in Environmental Science from Columbia University School of Public Health.

What is your role at IBM?

I am IBM’s Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. In this capacity I have responsibility for the health and safety of IBM’s over 350000 employees around the globe working in over 170 countries. My journey with IBM began 22 years ago where I was one of three physicians working at the RTP site.

What are some interesting projects you’ve worked on during your time at IBM?

There is no doubt that both the most interesting and the most challenging project I have worked on during my IBM career has been providing leadership for IBM’s COVID-19 pandemic response. This unprecedented event drew on every facet of my experience and expertise as a clinician a coach and a leader to ensure the health and safety of every IBMer across the globe.

A second very memorable project was leading the creation and deployment of IBM’s Milk Delivery program for nursing mothers. As a physician I understood the well reported positive impacts that breastfeeding has not only on an infant’s immediate health but on their longer-term growth and development. Being able to innovate a solution to allow mothers who needed/wanted to return to the workforce but still continue to nurse for as long as possible was extremely gratifying. This type of leadership is positive on so many levels.

How does the work you do at IBM impact society?

One of the things I love most about my role at IBM is that the culture and vibe are all about continuous growth and development. I challenge the team I lead Corporate Health and Safety to embrace and adopt the same growth mindset that the business leaders have and to innovate new and different ways of working with particular focus on leveraging the tools and expertise of our own enterprise.

A very recent example of this is the deployment of an application that assists with pandemic self-screening and access controls using technology created in collaboration with our IBM Watson Health team. This solution has also been deployed outside of IBM to help other companies manage the health and safety of their workers. Having these types of technologies available has made a great impact on society by helping employers that must continue to have workers access worksites during the pandemic mitigate exposure risk for their employees and for society at large while continuing to provide critical services.

What does Black History Month mean to you?

For me Black history month is a time to be reflective. Sure it is a time to celebrate the achievements of those who have paved the way for us and have contributed so much to our progress but for me it is also a time to pause and do a self-inventory of where I am and of what I personally have done to improve the conditions and create opportunities for black folks. To get to this point in my life and career I have stood on the shoulders of many giants. The question I have to ask myself is “Have I built shoulders broad enough and strong enough to support the next generation of leaders.” So Black History month for me is not just about reflecting on the past and celebrating our progress but it’s equally about recognizing that there is yet much to be done. It is also about being accountable to the role that I must play in continuing to move the needle on issues of racial disparities and social injustice that continue to exist today.

Do you think the Black experience in technology is a unique one?

In the technology industry the possibilities are limitless. Every new tool or innovation can have a significant impact to anyone in the world regardless of color or race and the outreach is greater since access can be virtual (e.g. telemedicine). I think that when it comes to technology like many other things the way in which Black Americans experience it is certainly different to how other ethnic groups experience it. However in many ways technology allows Black people and other groups to connect with one another in ways that were not previously possible. Like many other issues that face Black America equity and access as it applies to technology plays a big role in the way Black Americans experience technology.

I think the other key aspect of the Black experience with technology is having role models that look like us that are engaged in the development and deployment of technology at all levels. This ensures that technologies in development reflect a diverse and inclusive culture not only for Black people but for all groups and individuals.

What is an interesting fact about you that not many people know?

Most people don’t know that one of my true loves is for the arts. I began taking dance lessons at an early age and by the time I was 13 years old auditioned for a semi -professional dance company and was accepted. I danced with that company The Fuller Ebonaire Dancers until I left Detroit to attend Spelman College. I don’t dance anymore but I still enjoy attending concerts and watching professional companies like Alvin Ailey perform. Some of my former company members danced with Alvin Ailey and other professional companies and/or today own their own studios.

The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM is exploring a potential sale of its Watson Health business as CEO Arvind Krishna “moves to streamline the company and become more competitive in cloud computing”.

“Watson was one of IBM’s highest-profile initiatives in recent years and a big bet on the growing healthcare sector though results disappointed in part because physicians were hesitant to adopt artificial intelligence” the report said on Friday.

“IBM is studying alternatives for the unit that could include a sale to a private-equity firm or industry player or a merger with a blank-check company” the report added citing sources.

IBM currently has a market value of $108 billion way behind Cloud-computing rivals like AMAzon and Microsoft.

In its fourth quarter cognitive applications revenue which includes Watson Health came to $1.5 billion a decrease of 2 per cent year over year.

IBM Watson was one of the “strategic imperatives” under former CEO Ginni Rometty.

A weak cloud and cognitive software performance saw IBM shares sliding 6.6 per cent after the company missed Q4 revenue estimates posting its fourth straight quarter of revenue decline.

The Q4 (December 2020 quarter) sales totalled $20.4 billion down 6 per cent (on-year) and slightly below the $20.63 billion consensus.

Cloud and Cognitive Software sales dropped 5 per cent to $6.8 billion below the $7.18 billion estimates. Last quarter this segment was up 7 per cent.

IBM has appointed Martin Schroeter as the Chief Executive Officer of the independent company that will be created following the separation of IBM’s Managed Infrastructure Services business ï¿½NewCo’.

NewCo will focus on the management and modernisation of IT infrastructure in every industry around the world.

Ndu Emuchay an IBM Fellow working in Cloud Transformation Engineering joined IBM 23 years ago as part of the DBMX Ltd. Acquisition and was named the third Black IBM Fellow in company history last April.

“[Being named a Fellow] was elating and it was exhilarating” he said. “But it was also a feeling of more work to be done. It’s humbling to be in the company of the giants who are IBM Fellows so you want to live up to that status and promise of the platform you have.”

One way he’s been able to do that was in championing the Emb(race) Call for Code Spot Challenge and Call for Code for Racial Justice last year in 2020. Ndu and his team welcomed the internal and external coding challenges as opportunities to build open-source solutions that foster racial justice equity and equality with empathy and sustained action.

“It was something that allowed us to go from despair to hope” he said. “We put out solution building blocks to sustain impact over time and to shape the way that we bend the arc of justice toward racial justice and social justice. Being able to solve meaningful problems like that is what makes technology so exciting.”"

IDEX is extremely important as a platform for the exchange of experience and technologies and as an international forum offering unique opportunities in establishing new partnership links. “The Middle East and North Africa are now among key customers in the arms market. This region accounts for about 1/3 of the total market volume. Arms with the “Made in Russia” trademark are well known and sought-after here. They have made a very good showing in adverse climatic conditions – on the sea on the ground and in the air. Taking into account all the above mentioned the region is very important for us.

At year-end 2020 the MENA countries (Middle East and North Arica) accounted for over 50 % of all export supplies through Rosoboronexport. In addition to the growth of exports and product mix we have considerably expanded the geography of our cooperation in the region. In 2021 these positive trends will be continued in accordance with the objectives set out for us by the country’s leadership” said Director General of Rostec State Corporation Sergey Chemezov.

Traditionally Rosoboronexport acts as the organizer of Russia’s joint display at IDEX 2021 which in total occupies more than 1200 m² of the exhibition space in Hall 12. The joint display is representing products of the leading holdings of the Rostec State Corporation including JSC High Precision Weapons Uralvagonzavod Kalashnikov Group Technodinamika United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation Shvabe Holding and the largest Russia’s defence industry companies – Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Corporation JSC Concern Morinformsystem-Agat Research Production Association RusBiTech Proekt-Technika Corporation and the Kazan Gunpowder Plant.

Russia’s joint display is focused on the demonstration of technical assets and solutions aimed at responding to present-day security threats and challenges primarily in conditions of attack weapons development including missiles of various ranges and strike UAVs. Rosoboronexport will introduce at IDEX 2021 its approaches and solutions above all in the area of countering terrorist groups and provision of security of vital state infrastructure transportation and energy installations.

“In Abu-Dhabi Rosoboronexport is demonstrating newly-designed products from its export catalogue including the new armoured personnel carrier and infantry fighting vehicle on the basis of the Boomerang unified wheeled combat platform air defence missile systems Antei-4000 Viking and Tor-E2 which is done for the first time in this region.

It’s then you realize – for yet another year – that all you’ve really accomplished was buying a $12 domain from GoDaddy. We’ve all been there. For most people that will be the extent of their foray into entrepreneurship. Those who do put up a website will realize that while having a CEO bio on an “About Us” page is pretty cool they still have nothing. So they’ll “try to raise money” and start asking venture capital firms to sign NDAs and never make it into a meeting.

People who get meetings have something that wantrepreneurs don’t – traction. Nothing shows traction more than eating your own dog food that is using your product in the manner in which it was meant to be used realizing the benefits and then saying “see you can do this too.” A few weeks ago a company called Carta did something very cool. They sold shares of their own company on their own exchange. To understand the value proposition let’s start at the beginning.

Startups vs. Publicly Traded Companies

Some of our readers ask why we bother to cover startups when most retail investors can’t invest in them. The answer is that we need to be aware of what opportunities are coming – Twist Bioscience is a good example – or what threats might exist for stocks we’re already holding. Grail and Illumina is a good example of a story that played out between a public and private company. All of the stocks we hold (we eat our own dog food too) face threats from startups looking to emulate their successes.

One of the most frequent questions we get is how to invest in startups as a retail investor. If you are an accredited investor (which means you have achieved a certain net worth most people haven’t) you can go to “secondary markets” such as EquityZen or Forge and buy shares in startups from sellers. Usually these will be existing investors in the company or employees looking to sell shares for whatever reason. There are a few problems with this approach for retail investors aside from the need to be accredited.

The Need for Liquidity

The first problem is that minimums are quite high for people who like diversity. For example let’s say you wanted to invest 8% of your wealth across 10 startups. Since the minimum you can invest in any startup is $25000 that means you need to have a $3.25 million dollar portfolio to accomplish that. Most accredited investors are probably playing with a lot less than that. The need to sell such big blocks is because there’s not enough liquidity in these secondary markets.

The Need for Information

The most concerning problem is the inability to understand what you’re getting yourself into. If you sign up to one of those platforms and start browsing the collateral for an offering it starts to become very complicated very quickly. Even if you wasted invested six figures in an MBA you’d still need a lot of time to digest all this information in order to make an informed investment decision. So a fintech platform that can increase liquidity while providing accurate and standardized information about the assets being traded would be very valuable to investors.

Carta conveys their value proposition in a single sentence – “the first vertically integrated market ecosystem for private equity.” To understand that sentence we need to start with the foundation Carta built which lets them “vertically integrate.”

About Carta

Founded in 2012 San Francisco startup Carta has raised nearly $628 million in funding from names like Andreessen Horowitz DFJ Alumni Ventures Group and dozens of other notable names in the venture capital (VC) world. All these VCs were probably the source of Carta’s first customers as they could easily guide startups towards Carta’s software offering.

Carta happens to be the leader in cap table management software used by 17000 private companies. Simply put a capitalization table – or cap table – is a list of all the securities your company has issued and who owns them. It’s something that founders and lawyers pay very close attention to. This information can be aggregated to answer basic questions like “who are my biggest investors?” or “how much money have I raised?” or “am I being compliant?”

An example of a cap table – Credit: Carta

If you Google “cap table” you’ll find Carta telling you what a cap table is offering you a free Excel cap table template and then convincing you not to use it. Most companies that put their cap table in Excel usually end up with some convoluted mess that an attorney will happily charge $750 an hour to translate into something worthy.

Carta makes it easy for new companies to find them and use them. The Carta Launch plan is available through law firms and gives companies with up to 25 stakeholders that have raised up to $1 million access to cap table management for free. Carta is a great example of a company where their data is turning out to be more valuable than their core product offering. What they’re now able to do is create a stock exchange on top of that foundation allowing institutional investors to invest in private companies with financial data that comes from the horse’s mouth.

About CartaX

“Finally a private stock exchange” was the title of a Medium piece a few weeks ago talking about how Carta successfully sold their own shares on their own platform. Below you can see the progression of their market cap over time as they followed the yellow brick road of funding rounds to their first day of trading.

The first day of trading saw 1484 executed orders coming from 414 participants. Nearly $100 million in shares traded hands at quite the premium to the last funding round’s price ($6.9 billion today vs. $3.1 billion as of May 2020). Demonstrating that the platform works is a step towards having an exchange that can replace both the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and the secondary market.

CartaX vs. SPACs vs. Secondary Markets

We’ve talked before about how SPACs do a disservice to retail investors for any number of reasons. Some of what’s happening make the late 1990s stock price action look about as exciting as watching T-bills mature. The recent rumors of a Lucid Motors merger with a SPAC called Churchill Capital IV (CCIV) have shares up over +520% on the rumor alone. With 40% of SPAC trades being made by retail investors hedge funds are laughing all the way to the bank. Any well-meaning retiree who decides to invest in any of these SPACs is quickly going to get steamrolled as the Robinhood weekday warriors turn the market into one big casino.

From the perspective of a startup founder SPACs seem like a no-brainer. Make hay while the sun shines. After the SPAC issuers who make millions for very little actual work it’s the founder who is next in line to benefit with a giant pile of cash they can now use to extend their runway. The goal of every business is to survive and they just increased their lifespan by a few years with very little work.

It’s the retail investor who actually wants to invest in Lucid Motors right now who is getting the short end of the stick. That’s where CartaX can provide the same benefits as a SPAC without all the cow manure. The venerable WSJ published an opinion piece last week which talked about how “private-share markets including CartaX and Nasdaq Private Market offer startup shareholders seeking liquidity an alternative to IPOs and SPACs.” This is a good segue into talking about competing platforms where investors can transact in shares of private companies what we refer to as “secondary markets.”

The OG of secondary markets was the aptly named SecondaryMarket which was acquired by Nasdaq in 2015 and is now called the Nasdaq Private Market. The last time we looked at the remaining secondary markets in 2018 it was a three-horse race: EquityZen SharesPost and Equidate. Since then SharesPost and Equidate merged and rebranded to Forge. Where Carta differentiates their offering from all these competitors is in the foundational cap table management solution that’s now being used by over 17000 private companies. That’s a pretty formidable barrier to entry.

What Carta Thinks

The only good thing about Medium is that a fair number of company leaders use the platform as a mechanism to communicate with the masses. Unfortunately they’re using Medium so their messages usually get lost among insightful gems like “The Little Mermaid Is Really About Unrequited Gay Love” or “Is Penis Size Genetic?” (the answer is kind of sort of). Fortunately that didn’t stop Carta Co-Founder and CEO Henry Ward from dropping some wisdom about his company on Medium.

Mr. Ward says it’s odd that private markets have zero liquidity public markets have hyper-liquidity and there is nothing in between. This causes three main problems:

Employees live poorer because a large portion of their wealth is locked up in shares with no market.

Seed investments are more expensive for founders because of the excessive duration risk the investor is taking not to mention how likely it is that most startups fail – increased total loss risk.

Late-stage startups have to compete with large corporations for talent without offering all the upside that comes with a startup. Most people would rather work at Microsoft than a late-stage startup. Mediocre talent would happily take either job.

That’s the case for founders to consider offering liquidity earlier. For their own shares Carta plans to offer a trading window once per quarter which means their employees only sold a modest amount of shares in their initial offering as a few weeks ago. They know they always have the option to sell shares later.

If you’re a startup looking to offer shares on the CartaX platform the latest Medium post says they’re booked through March 2021. That’s great to see. If you’re a retail investor you’ll need to wait too. Right now CartaX is looking to onboard institutional investors. Funds like Draper Esprit or Scottish Mortgage would probably find the CartaX platform incredibly useful to manage their private company investments. It would only make sense down the road that a winning private equity exchange would start to accommodate accredited retail investors as well presumably with low minimums because they have the liquidity.

A key value proposition of CartaX for retail investors is the ability to invest alongside institutional investors not in the absence of them as is the case for equity crowdfunding something that investors should avoid like the plague. Loads of platforms let you buy shares in private companies that aren’t traded and are more or less worthless until there’s an exit event.

Conclusion

Our perspective is to always prioritize the needs of institutional and retail investors first because they pay our bills. We are adamantly against SPACs because they do a large disservice to anyone who wants to invest in the underlying target that’s being acquired by the SPAC. The people at the wheel of the SPAC vehicle want to get their 20% locked down before the music stops so transactions are becoming more haphazard. If CartaX promises to displace SPACs we’re all for it.

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

The card is a dual-port 10GbE card and that is exactly what we were looking for. Instead of purchasing an Intel branded card we purchased these. In our review we are simply going to show-off the card and give a quick check on performance.

Silicom PE310G2I50-T Hardware Overview

The PE310G2I50-T is a low-profile card and comes in a fairly standard form factor. We can see the Intel X550 chipset heatsink that is held in place by metal pins and springs. These metal pins may not seem like a big feature but STH had a 10Gbase-T card burn up as the Most Spectacular Hardware Failure in the STH/ Lab in 2016 because a plastic pin failed.

While many vendors simply purchase Intel X550-T2 cards and re-brand them we wanted to note that Silicom is actually doing engineering on these cards. Above one can see the Silicom card with a heatsink that provides a lot of surface area. One can also see the metal shield/ brace that runs along the bottom edge of the card. The only image of the Intel X550-T2 I could find in the STH CMS was a stock photo but here is what that card looks like that makes it clear Silicom is doing design work not just re-labeling an Intel card.

Silicom if you are not aware makes specialty cards for companies such as Dell and other OEMs and has been around for years. If you read STH you may have a network card made by Silicom and not know it.

One may also notice quickly that the heatsinks on these cards are much smaller than on the X540 generations of cards. The X550 is Intel’s newer generation that is much better on power/ thermals while adding new features. To give some sense the X540 version of this card is rated at 14.28W with both ports operating at 10Gbase-T speeds. This card is rated at 8.16W. That is around a 43% decrease in power which is a massive generational improvement.

We get two ports since this is a dual 10Gbase-T card.

The back of the card has large stickers and not much else. We will just quickly note here that the stickers have a small but welcome feature they feature large barcodes. That may seem trivial but it just makes them faster/ easier to scan for data center technicians. Even the text seems like it is sized for more mature eyes than some of the micro text and barcodes we have seen on NICs.

With this generation we also get a PCIe Gen3 x4 slot. The Intel X540 was a PCIe Gen2 card so that is another subtle generational difference. We should probably do a full guide of the X540 to X550 differences. There is a lot that was updated such as moving from 32 to 128 transmit queues VMDq Virtual Device Queues per port moved from 16 to 64 and also 2.5/5GbE support. Perhaps that should be its own reference piece.

We have full-height brackets installed for these photos but the card can use either full-height or low-profile brackets.

Next let us take a look at the performance before getting to our final words.

Silicom PE310G2I50-T Performance

Overall we have a good sense of how this card will perform. It has a well-known controller onboard.

We verified that we were seeing 10GbE speeds on the card.

There is not much to say here. The card performs as we would expect from a modern dual 10Gbase-T solution.

Final Words

Overall the Silicom PE310G2I50-T is a solid card. It has dual 10Gbase-T ports and runs at considerably lower power than its predecessors.

We recently reviewed the Intel X710-T4 quad-port 10Gbase-T NIC but there are certainly trade-offs with moving up to a quad-port card. The dual-port X550 solution uses less power and is less expensive which will often make it a better choice.

Overall this is one of our shortest reviews in recent memory. This card simply worked out-of-box as it is based on a well-supported chipset.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzg4NjkzLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktcm9ja2V0LWxha2UtY3B1cy1nZXQtZ2xvdy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel gives its enthusiast Rocket Lake SKU a unique new retail box,"Rumor mill: New retail packaging for Intel's 11th-gen Rocket Lake CPUs has been spotted in the wild and stands out from previous iterations. The hard plastic boxes have an odd shape that will stand out on shelves which Intel likely hopes will increase hype around a generation of chips they need to be successful.

Intel Rocket Lake CPUs are slated to launch next month. A new leak from VideoCardz has revealed the packing we can expect to come with the top-of-the-line Core i9 chips. Based on the leaked images the new packaging is made entirely or at least largely of hard plastic with opaque deep Intel blue on the front and back faces and translucent baby blue windows on the sides. The box looks like four trapezoids stacked front-to-back to give a look that should stand out from the pack.

Intel's 10th gen packaging featured a small acrylic window and harkened back to the rectangular box design of 8th gen and earlier. This new box is more in line with the stand-out-in-a-crowd attitude that fed the design of the i9-9900k two years ago.

According to the leak apparently the i9-11900KF will be given the usual cube-shaped treatment so the hard plastic box that will invariably serve as wall-hangings for many tech youtubers will be restricted to only the most enthusiast buyers.

Rocket Lake will be yet another release on the 14nm process node backported from the new Sunny Cove architecture which means it will see a number of improvements and up to 5.3GHz peak boost. That said the core counts on these cards look to trail behind AMD's current offering and Intel will need Rocket Lake to be a success as they work to fix their process node issues.

This new packaging will either celebrate a speedy new chip or try to gin up some interest (remember the Marvel-themed Intel packaging?) in a company under duress.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9JbWFnZXMtb2YtUm9ja2V0LUxha2UtSW50ZWwtQ29yZS1pOS1wYWNrYWdpbmctbGVha2VkLVRoZS1pOS0xMTkwMEstaXMtc28tZmFzdC1pdHMtYm94LWNhbi10LWtlZXAtdXAuNTIyODg1LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Images of Rocket Lake Intel Core i9 packaging leaked: The i9-11900K is so fast its box can't keep up,"Pictures of the packaging for the upcoming Intel Core i9 members of the Rocket Lake-S series have leaked online. While some of the top-end parts get typically blue boxes in Intel’s updated livery the speedy i9-11900K gets unusual packaging that has led some to comment that AMD and Ryzen 5000 has already crushed it.

4 Reviews

VideoCardz has published pictures of four boxes pertaining to the Rocket Lake-S family of processors that Intel will be unleashing onto the world possibly around March 15. The packaging is for the top-end Core i9 processors: i9-11900K i9-11900KF i9-11900 and i9-11900F. The boxes for the latter three have been mostly met with praise so far while the box for the Intel Core i9-11900K has been splitting opinions.

As can be seen in the images below the boxes for the i9-11900KF (unlocked; no iGPU) i9-11900 and i9-11900F (no active iGPU) are unsurprisingly blue and feature Intel’s updated logo. The packaging is simple and effective and would easily stand out on computer hardware retailer shelves. The words “11th Gen” can also be seen and a sticker with the SKU name will be added to each box to help distinguish between them. The reminder ""discrete graphics required"" is also visible on the packaging for the F-variants.

However Intel decided to give the i9-11900K a box that really makes it stand out. As essentially the quickest chip out of the bunch it seems appropriate that the packaging looks a bit like it got bounced around a lot during a speedy delivery. Some have joked that AMD and Ryzen have already been beating it although others have taken a shine to the unique design which should at least help prevent it from being easily shoplifted.

Well we now have a look at retail packaging for the new Intel Core i9-11900K flagship CPU and it looks fantastic. It's very different to the already great retail packaging of the Core i9-10900K processor but with a radically tweaked retail box that I don't think I've seen a CPU ship in before.

Intel is also debuting their new 11th Gen Core desktop CPUs with the updated Core logos but the flagship Core i9-11900K processor is the only one with the super-fancy retail packaging. The rest of the line up has some new design work and logo updates on the packaging but they're just regular square boxes.

Planet Fitness is preparing to open a new location in Salem next month.

The gym which will be about 16000 square feet will include cardio and strength equipment and a spa for Black Card members with HydroMassage beds and tanning Becky Zirlen senior public relations manager said in an email.

“We cater to first-time and casual gym goers who may have never belonged to a gym before” Zirlen wrote. “We always strive for a non-intimidating judgement free atmosphere where our members can feel comfortable working out at their own pace.”

Planet Fitness’ new location will be at 1359 W. Main St. The Keith Corporation a North Carolina-based real estate firm purchased the shopping center which previously housed a Kmart in 2019. The space was divided to allow for multiple commercial tenants and also includes a Tractor Supply Co.

The gym is expected to open in mid-March and Zirlen said new members can join with a special offer starting Monday by searching for the Salem location on the Planet Fitness website.

Planet Fitness already has two clubs in Roanoke — one at Towers Shopping Center and the other on Orange Avenue — and one in Christiansburg.

Arturo Di Modica died at his home in Vittoria on Friday evening the town said in a statement on Saturday. Di Modica had been ill for some time it said.

The sculptor lived in New York for more than 40 years in New York. He arrived in 1973 and opened an art studio in the city's SoHo neighborhood. With the help of a truck and crane Di Modica installed the bronze bull sculpture in New York’s financial district without permission on the night of Dec. 16 1989.

The artist reportedly spent $350000 of his own money to create the 3.5-ton bronze beast that came to symbolize the resilience of the U.S. economy after a 1987 stock market crash.

“It was a period of crisis. The New York Stock Exchange lost in one night more than 20% and so many people were plunged into the blackest of depressions"" Rome daily La Repubblica quoted Di Modica as saying in an interview earlier this month.

He said he conceived of the bull sculpture as “a joke a provocation. Instead it became a cursedly serious thing” destined to be one of New York's more visited monuments.

In the La Repubblica interview Di Modica detailed how he some 40 friends a crane and a truck carried out a lightning-swift operation to plant the statue near Bowling Green park a short stroll from the headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange without official authorization.

“Five minutes. The operations shouldn't have lasted more. Otherwise we'd risk big"" he recalled. ""After a couple of scouting trips I had discovered that at night the police made its rounds on Wall Street every 7-8 minutes.”

When the sculptor and his friends arrived at the spot he'd picked they were surprised to see a Christmas tree had been erected there. They deposited the bronze bull anyway and as the artist told it uncorked a bottle of Champagne.

Di Modica left Vittoria Sicily at age 19 for Florence where he studied at the Fine Arts Academy.

At the time of his death he was working on prototypes for a twin horse sculpture he planned to make for the Sicilian town. It was envisioned as a 40-meter-high (132-foot-high) work to be erected on the banks of a river.

The town declared Monday when Di Modica’s funeral will be held in Vittoria’s St. John the Baptist Church as an official day of mourning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFydG5ld3NwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMi9hcnR1cm8tZGktbW9kaWNhLXNjdWxwdG9yLWJlaGluZC1uZXcteW9ya3MtY2hhcmdpbmctYnVsbC1oYXMtZGllZC1hZ2VkLTgw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arturo Di Modica sculptor behind New York's Charging Bull has died aged 80,"Arturo Di Modica the Sicilian-born sculptor best known for his Charging Bull statue in New York’s financial district has died aged 80. He died at home in the Italian town of Vittoria in southern Sicily. A cause of death has not been named but he had been ill for several years.

Born into humble means in Vittoria in 1941 Di Modica moved to Florence in 1960 to study at the Academy of Fine Arts. After gaining some recognition in the late 1960s he moved to New York in 1973 establishing a studio for himself in SoHo. By the mid 1980s he had gained a number of wealthy patrons and could be spotted driving his Ferrari around Lower Manhattan.

In 1987 following the stock market crash of Black Monday Di Modica felt indebted to the nation that had made him a success and so he spent $325000 of his own money and two years of time crafting Charging Bull which he illegally dropped off in the middle of the night in front of the New York Stock Exchange in 1989.

The following morning the 3.5-ton sculpture was moved by city officials into a police warehouse in Queens but by that evening Di Modica received an offer to install the sculpture in nearby Bowling Green park where it currently resides. He paid a $500 fine for the illegal installation and four days later Charging Bull was moved to its new location.

This was not Di Modica’s first piece of guerrilla public art in New York; following the disappointing reception of a 1977 exhibition he relocated the show’s eight sculptures to Rockefeller Center (again he had to pay a fine) and on Valentine’s Day 1985 he dropped off a massive statue of a horse titled Il Cavallo at Lincoln Center plaza.

In 2017 artist Kristen Visbal placed her sculpture Fearless Girl across from Charging Ball in a similar guerrilla fashion. Though Fearless Girl was wildly popular among tourists Di Modica argued that it altered the meaning of his sculpture changing it from an image of optimism to one of oppression. In 2018 Fearless Girl was moved a few blocks away to the New York Stock Exchange.

In the late 2000s Di Modica bought 13 acres in his hometown of Vittoria to build a sculpture school eventually selling his New York studio to help fund it. At the time of his death he was at work on a 132-foot tall sculpture of two horses to be installed at a nearby river.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbG9jYWwvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9hcnR1cm8tZGktbW9kaWNhLWNyZWF0b3Itb2Ytd2FsbC1zdHJlZXRzLWNoYXJnaW5nLWJ1bGwtc2N1bHB0dXJlLWRpZXMtYXQtODAvMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9jZWIwYjI5NC03MzljLTExZWItOTNiZS1jMTA4MTNlMzU4YTJfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arturo Di Modica creator of Wall Street's 'Charging Bull' sculpture dies at 80,Arturo Di Modica the artist who sculpted “Charging Bull” the bronze statue in New York that became an iconic symbol of Wall Street died Feb. 19 at his home in Vittoria on the Italian island of Sicily.

Gemma Potter hit her breaking point in early February.

After six months of being told she couldn’t come to America the Australian basketball player a key member of UCLA’s 2020 signing class accepted defeat. So Potter a 6-foot guard known for knocking down long-range shots decided she’d forgo a college education in the states – and NCAA eligibility. Instead she'd turn pro in her home country. It's not what she wanted but it seemed like her only option.

Her teammate Izzy Anstey another Aussie stuck in Melbourne is holding out hope. She’s had her bagged packed for months waiting. As soon as Anstey gets clearance she’ll be on a plane to Los Angeles. Potter will be staying behind.

""I hear people say ‘Oh it’s just basketball it’s just athletes wanting special treatment’” Potter said from Melbourne. “But for us basketball is our life. I haven’t figured out my identity outside of basketball yet. I wanted to do that at UCLA.”

It's not a problem unique to Potter Anstey or other athletes: for thousands of other first-year international students who hope to study in the U.S. for the 2020-21 academic year time is running out. That’s because the Department of Homeland Security and ICE aren’t allowing first-year international students to come to the U.S. if their schools aren’t offering in-person courses.

Since the pandemic started almost a year ago guidance on Student and Exchange Visitors Programs has been all over the map. As COVID wound its way across the U.S. DHS said it was fine for international students to attend college in the U.S. completely online. With the pandemic raging in July Trump officials reversed course declaring that international students must attend class in-person or leave the U.S. Universities revolted. A lawsuit led by Harvard and MIT forced DHS to relent but only for returning international students. That left first years – some athletes many not – stranded around the world.

'Cruel abrupt and unlawful': States sue Trump administration over college student visa rule

In October Potter Anstey and 14 other athletes who are supposed to be participating in sports at either UCLA or Loyola Marymount University from countries including Australia Norway and Britain filed a lawsuit against DHS and ICE.

The suit contends that in late July DHS-ICE reversed a previous July 6 order from President Donald Trump that banned most international students — and for the first time issued guidance which barred first-year international students if they enrolled in 100% online courses. If the initial order was reversed the suit argues first-year student-athletes — who participate in daily in-person practice — should be allowed in. Though the athletes were approved for their student visas their certification forms were deferred leaving them in a lurch.

The next court date is set for Monday Feb. 22 when a federal judge will decide whether or not to dismiss the case. If the case continues so does the fight to get into America.

DHS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

For UCLA coach Cori Close it’s a layered issue: Her team currently ranked No. 8 in the country needs roster depth. She's stressed about personally letting down families she made promises to in the recruiting process.

But in the big picture she worries about the consequences of losing a class – or two or three – of international students across higher education.

“If we’ve learned anything in this country in the last nine months it’s that we are desperate for healing and bridge building and diverse perspectives that increase our empathy and compassion” Close said. “How do we do that without international students? They are the heartbeat of cultural growth. We are missing out if we don’t let them in.”

A boon to U.S. economy

International students are hugely important to the U.S. economy in myriad of ways said Gaurav Khanna an economist at the University of California-San Diego. They funnel millions of dollars into the academic system as most pay full tuition rates (international students account for about 5% of students at American universities and colleges according to NAFSA the association of international educators). NAFSA estimates that in the 2018-19 school year alone 1 million international students were responsible for contributing an eye-popping $41 billion to the U.S. economy.

Public universities in particular many of whom have seen state funding cut — and raised tuition prices in response — need money from international students.

'You're not wanted': Trump's proposed college student visa changes worry international students – again

“Especially when state budgets are plummeting because of our current economic crisis we need international students’ money more than ever” Khanna said. “So exactly when we need it most we’re restricting it. That’s not good.”

According to the National Student Clearinghouse which tracks enrollment data international student enrollments have dropped substantially by almost 15% and are the only student group that experienced declines in graduate enrollment dropping by almost 8%. But that might be lowballing it.

Kirk Pasich the lawyer representing the student-athletes and his firm estimate there are roughly 200000 total (non-athlete) first-year international students locked outside the U.S. because of DHS guidance. At UCSD Khanna and colleagues calculated that between March and September 2020 the U.S. granted only 37680 student visas — a staggering decline of 87% compared to the average of 290000 visas the last two academic years.

Contributions from international students are felt long after they obtain their degree too.

Many stay in the U.S. after graduating feeding into professional STEM programs making valuable discoveries in the technology and health care sectors — two areas Khanna pointed out that have proven to be hugely important over the last year especially. Losing that pipeline could have decades-long consequences.

At UC-San Diego international students make up almost one fifth of the university's student population. That number hasn't dropped significantly according to Dulce Dorado the director of the International Students & Programs Office but it's hard to know the actual physical location of students because they self-report: some are on campus some might be in other U.S. locations and some could be stuck in their home countries.

It's not just DHS rules holding them back either. The pandemic has forced closures everywhere including at U.S. embassies. And for those who can't get a visa appointment getting an actual visa is nearly impossible.

Biden friendlier to immigrants but is it too late?

Many  including Khanna Close and Pasich are optimistic that President Joe Biden’s administration will be friendly to immigrants especially after four years of hostility from Trump. There’s a chance DHS amends the rules in time for Anstey and other student-athletes to join their teams for the tail end of their seasons. And if schools return to in-person classes by fall — a likely scenario given vaccine availability — that will also mean first-year internationals will be allowed.

But there are still issues in both the immediate and long term.

Julie Myers Wood ran ICE from 2006-08 at the end of the George W. Bush administration. She's now the CEO of Guidepost Solutions a firm that works with universities to make sure they’re in compliance with federal regulations regarding international students.

Wood has been consulting with Pasich on the case involving the UCLA and LMU athletes and empathizes with students who she said are “getting caught up in government bureaucracy and regulations that aren’t designed to handle something like a pandemic.”

And Wood wonders what happens during the next crisis? In the same way that the attacks of September 11 2001 exposed dangerous gaps in the student visa program — one of the terrorists involved got into the U.S. on a student visa then never showed up for class — the pandemic has exposed other issues. Wood said higher education needs to be ready.

“Schools universities and others should recognize that the U.S. government will never be the most nimble” she said. “So right now they should be asking themselves what if we’re in remote-only learning for years? And what about the next time?”

It’s the government’s job to examine serious security threats in a thoughtful and careful manner Wood said. But the government should also be encouraging “the best and brightest the most talented students from everywhere to come to the U.S. versus Canada or some other place. It’s in our national interest to have them come to the U.S.”

Dorado at UC-San Diego said the pandemic has made clear that ""we're a global community we're all interconnected and we need to work together to solve the world's problems – international students are a big part of that.""

But Khanna her colleague at UCSD wonders if the damage has already been done. It’s not just about this class of first-year students; acceptance letters will start arriving soon and students all over the world will decide their futures. He’s worried that given the rhetoric of the last four years they might not be looking toward America.

“One thing the Trump administration made clear is how arbitrary immigration policy can be”Khanna said. “If I’m thinking of coming here as a student I see that Biden is in power now but by the time I graduate someone else might be in power — and that person might be much more anti-immigrant.”

Potter who fell in love with UCLA the second she set foot on campus said the situation doesn't make her hate America. If anything she understands the need to be safe: Australia has been in a strict lockdown since COVID hit. But even if the restriction was lifted next week Potter said she had to move on for mental health purposes.

""I tried so hard to stick it out"" she said. ""The uncertainty around school basketball and life in general it was so hard. Having clarity is amazing. But I know the other people in this lawsuit are struggling. Waking up every day wondering if there's going to be a hearing or a decision it's horrible.

""I'm content with my decision but college was always a dream for me.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jZ3RuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDItMjEvQXJ0dXJvLURpLU1vZGljYS1zY3VscHRvci1vZi10aGUtV2FsbC1TdHJlZXQtQ2hhcmdpbmctQnVsbC1kaWVzLVkzcXVnWnphYlMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jZ3RuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDItMjEvQXJ0dXJvLURpLU1vZGljYS1zY3VscHRvci1vZi10aGUtV2FsbC1TdHJlZXQtQ2hhcmdpbmctQnVsbC1kaWVzLVkzcXVnWnphYlMvc2hhcmVfYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arturo Di Modica sculptor of the Wall Street Charging Bull dies,"Italian sculptor Arturo Di Modica who created the famous ""Charging Bull"" statue which has become a symbol of New York's Wall Street died overnight at the age of 80 Italian media reported Saturday.

The artist who died at his home in Vittoria in the south of the island of Sicily ""had been battling cancer for years and his condition had worsened in recent weeks"" La Repubblica daily said on its website.

Di Modica who was born in Vittoria shot to fame after illegally leaving his bronze 4.9 meter-long 3.2-tonne Charging Bull outside the New York Stock Exchange building in December 1989.

When he and his friends turned up in a truck carrying the huge sculpture they found that the NYSE Christmas tree had been installed exactly where he had wanted to place the sculpture. They left the Charging Bull under the 12-meter tree.

He had financed the bronze statue himself at a cost of $350000. Di Modica had wanted to give something back to his adoptive city in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash.

Di Modica later said the sculpture was a symbol of people's strength – ""You can do it by yourself. My point was that you must be strong.""

The New York Stock Exchange swiftly had the sculpture removed but it was soon given a permanent location at the Bowling Green public park on Broadway.

In a recent interview with La Repubblica the sculptor recalled the idea behind the Charging Bull. ""It was a time of crisis the New York Stock Exchange had plummeted more than 20 percent overnight. With some friends I asked myself what I could do for for 'my' town.

""Of course I am from Vittoria but I lived for more than 40 years in New York. And I got the idea to sculpt a bull the image of a stock exchange on the rise. It must have been a witticism a provocation. But it turned into something serious.""

""I have been told that after the Statue of Liberty the 'Charging Bull' right next to the temple of finance is the most visited monument in New York. It even beats the Empire State Building"" he added.

Di Modica's sculpture is certainly one of the most photographed subjects in the Big Apple.

A legend has developed that if visitors rub the nose horns and testicles of the bronze bull they'll have good luck. The shininess of these parts of the sculpture attest."

Recently Morocco was cited as an example by the UN Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Inger Andersen who said the Kingdom stands as a model thanks to its large-scale investments in producing electricity from wind and solar power.

Speaking at a joint news conference with UN chief Antonio Guterres she made the case for a global shift into clean energy in order to “make peace with nature.”

Two weeks ago Financial Times zoomed on the need to speed up energy transformation towards renewables mentioning the potential that such a shift bears for countries reliant on gas and oil imports such as Morocco.

“For places such as Morocco which imports more than 80 per cent of its energy but also has abundant solar resources the transition could be an economic gift” wrote the paper in a story titled “How the race for renewable energy is reshaping global politics.”

Earlier this month Morocco and Portugal signed a deal to cooperate in green hydrogen production key to laying basis for carbon-free industries.

Besides its target to generate 52% of its energy mix from renewable sources by 2030 Morocco plans to cut by 20% its energy consumption by the same year.

Even the biggest names in asset management can get it wrong and BestInvest just called out some of the top losers.

In its twice-yearly 'Spot the Dog' report the online investment service names and shames the top underperforming funds and firms and Invesco has topped the list for the sixth time in a row.

""The top slot in Spot the Dog continues to be held by Invesco with 11 funds totalling £9.2 billion. Four of these funds are Tibetan Mastiff-sized beasts"" the report said.

However the report which doesn't win any popularity contest among fund managers does note that Invesco's number of funds that made the list has fallen this time.

What is a 'dog fund'?

So how does BestInvest identify the funds that fall into this somewhat cruel category using two filters?

First it filters by fund universe to identify ""those that have failed to beat the benchmark over three consecutive 12-month periods"" the report said.

The benchmark chosen by BestInvest is determined by the sector the fund designating one that operates in an index that ""represents the overall movements in the market that the fund operates in"" it said.

This highlights those that have consistently underperformed and allows the research to remove those that ""may simply have had a short run of bad luck"" it added.

Secondly the funds must have underperformed the benchmark by 5% or more over the entire three-year period of analysis.

The Kennel Club

These are the firms with the most assets under management which made the list because of their ""dog funds"":

1. Invesco

For the sixth time running Invesco has landed the top ""dog"" spot with 11 funds making the list worth £9.2 billion in total. Admittedly this is down from 13 funds valued at £11.4 billion from the last report.

Two of the firm's funds were repeat offenders on the list: Invesco's UK Equity High Income and UK Equity Income funds delivering -21% and -19% respectively over a three year period compared to the benchmark.

But in the firm's defence these funds were only recently handed to new managers ""who are now tasked with turning them around"" the report said.

Moreover Invesco has gone through a broad shakeup over the last year after the appointment of a new chief investment officer Stephanie Butcher.

""This is clearly a work in progress"" the report added.

2. Jupiter

The UK-based firm Jupiter leapt up the rankings from ninth to second place in this report following its July 2020 acquisition of Merian Global Investors making it ""rescue home for two sizeable beasts"" the note said

The now enlarged group oversees 8 ""dog funds"" totalling £4.1 billion of assets. The biggest of these is the Merian North American Equity fund which has seen a -14% return in the last three years compared to the benchmark.

3. St. James Place

St James's Place's (SJP) in-house fund range has frequently ""lurked near the top spot in the hall of shame"" and sits in third position with four funds totalling £4 billion the report said.

The number of SJP funds that made this edition has halved since the last with the SJP UK High Income fund previously managed by fallen star Neil Woodford escaping the shaming.

The SJP Global Smaller Companies fund was one of this edition's biggest losers in the Global sector coming fifth in that particular list and trailing the benchmark by -32%.

4. Schroders

Schroders took this edition's fourth place after it number of funds to make the list rose to 11 with an increase of £4 billion in asset.

Three of the Schroder's included are managed by its QEP team the report highlight who use a ""systematic data driven investment process.""

Both the Schroder European Recovery and Global Recovery funds - which target undervalued companies - made the list underperforming the benchmark -22% and -33% respectively. These and the firm's income funds investing in the US Europe and globally struggled in the 2020 environment where 'growth' stocks significantly outperformed.

These growth sectors include technology and communications services which have been the biggest 'COVID-winners' like video-conferencing software Zoom and EV company Tesla.

Therefore growth strategies largely left funds targeting undervalued companies or dividend-generating businesses lagging in the dust during 2020.

However if the global economy recovers as most banks are forecasting these 'recovery' or 'value' plays could catch-up making significant gains.

Of note the report excluded the £3.3 billion 'dog fund' managed by the firm in its joint venture with Lloyds Bank.

5. JPMorgan Asset Management

JPMorgan's inclusion in the top five came down solely due to the JP Morgan US Equity Income fund with its huge £3.2 billion in AUM which fell -27% below the benchmark the report said.

Unfortunately for JPMAM the fund has been underweight technology stocks in a period when companies like FAANG and tech cult names like Tesla have been market leaders as many tech companies do not pay dividends.

But like Schroders this could turn around if value sectors like Banks and energy — which are the main dividend payers — catch up on any economic recovery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLW51bWJlci1wb29yLXBlcmZvcm1pbmctZG9nLWZ1bmRzLXNvYXJzLWJ5LXRoaXJkLTE0MDYzMDMyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coronavirus: Underperforming 'dog' funds hit record levels,"The number of funds that have consistently underperformed in the markets they invest in this year has risen by a third new data has shown.

Bestinvest’s Spot the Dog report which has been exposing badly performing funds since it launched in 1994 named 119 market investment funds in its latest report collectively representing £49.6bn ($69.5bn) in customer’s long-term savings.

The research which is released biannually uses statistical fund performance data to identify funds that have performed badly compared to their benchmark.

To be included a fund must meet certain criteria including delivering a worse return than the market it invests in for each one of the last three 12-month periods in a row. Secondly it must also have underperformed the market it invests in by more than 5% over the entire three year period under review.

At least 15 funds on the list are managed by some of the financial services industry’s biggest names each holding more than a billion pounds of investors' cash.

Fund giant Invesco (IVZ) retained the “top dog” spot for the sixth time in a row with 11 funds worth £9.2bn of assets.

Jupiter (JUP.L) climbed up to second place after acquiring Merian Global Investors last year while St. James’s Place (STJ.L) and Schroders (SDR.L) came in third and fourth place respectively.

The report covers funds investing across a wide selection of markets including the UK global equities North America Europe Asia (excluding Japan) Japan and Global Emerging Markets.

The highest count of consistent underachievers was found in the global equities sector while North America had a prolific number of dog funds at 21.

Jason Hollands managing director at Bestinvest said: “If your savings are tied-up in an investment fund that is repeatedly delivering worse returns than the market it invests in then then you really owe it to yourself to take a closer look and think about whether you might be better off moving it elsewhere.

“The differences between the best and worst performing funds are enormous and so it is essential to choose funds very carefully and then keep a beady eye on them or opt for low-cost trackers instead. The latter won’t beat the returns of market but will closely mimic them.”

He added that it is not always obvious to savers if their money was tied up in a dog fund as a majority of the funds still made returns. Only 32 of the 119 lost investors’ cash.

“Of course the past is not the future and there can be times when it might be worth hanging on” he said.

“For example if a new manager with a better track record has recently put in charge or because you believe an approach that has been out of favour is about to make a come-back. However if you really cannot find a convincing reason to stay-put in an investment also-ran then moving elsewhere could give your ISA or pension a new lease of life.”

But twice a year a report surfaces that names and shames underperforming investment funds and managers 'live in fear of being included in the kennel of shame' according to its authors.

The 'Spot the Dog' research by Bestinvest gives investors the chance to see which funds belong in the doghouse and which for the time being deserve to be on the main stage at Crufts.

It's a dog eat dog world: The fund world is highly competitive but often fraught with pitfalls

The latest findings by Bestinvest show that the number of underachievers on the fund front has jumped.

This is partly due to the gulf between the performance of growth versus value and income funds which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.

The difference in performance levels is striking. While the average fund in the IA Global sector posted a 32.4 per cent return the best performer managed to make a 162.6 per cent return and the poorest ended up down 9.6 per cent.

'This highlights the need to be super selective when choosing a fund manager to look after your cash and once invested how important it is to continue to regularly monitor your investments and check whether they are delivering value for money' Bestinvest said.

Which big fund firms belong in the dog house?

All in all 119 investment funds have consistently underperformed the sectors they invest in according to Bestinvest which is part of the Tilney group. A copy of its full 32-page report is available for free here.

The amount of money represented by the severe underperformers is a whopping £49.6billion. The list of 'mutts' meanwhile has increased by 33 per cent in a year and it features some of the City's most prestigious names - Invesco Jupiter and Schroders included.

Invesco has retained its place as 'Top Dog' for the sixth time in a row. Eleven Invesco funds feature in the doghouse listings with a total value of £9.2billion.

It's enough to make you yelp: The 10 worst performing fund management groups in Bestinvest's latest findings

How does a fund get labelled a 'dog'?

A fund must have failed to beat its benchmark for three 12-month periods running and underperformed by five per cent or more over the entire three years.

The report is not a 'sell list' but is based on an analysis of past performance which is not necessarily a guide to how a fund will perform in the future. In many cases it is likely that the cyclical and financial environment of recent years have simply not suited the fund's raison d'etre.

There may be good reasons to believe that in some cases future prospects are brighter.

So which funds have done particularly badly?

Here are two lists of the top 20 underforming dog funds first by size and second by the extent to which they have lagged their sector.

Some of the Invesco funds including the former flagship Invesco Income and Invesco UK Equity High Income funds have now been handed over to new managers who have been tasked with turning their fortunes around.

Pawful: The most significant underperformers in the latest Spot the Dog report by Bestinvest

The Invesco UK Equity High Income Fund has underperformed the market it invests in to the tune of minus 21 per cent while the Invesco European Equity Fund is lagging by 17 per cent over the three-year period according to Bestinvest.

'Invesco's investment centre in Henley has been going through a shake-up over the last year under a new chief investment officer. This is clearly a work in progress' Bestinvest said.

Jupiter has also fared poorly in Bestinvest's latest rankings.

It leapt from ninth to second place having become a rescue home for Merian Global Investors which it snapped up last year.

UK wealth manager St James's Place came in third place in the worst-of-the-worst list with the group having its own fund range which is delegated out to external managers.

'It has frequently lurked near the top spot in the hall of shame and sits in third position with four funds totalling £4billion' Bestinvest said.

Schroders came in as the fourth worst-ranked firm but it has seen an increase in assets to £4billion and its tally of funds has swelled to 11.

JP Morgan has also found its way into fifth place having previously been all the way down at 45 in the worst-rated rankings.

While the five fund firms above scored poorly the overall worst performing fund in Bestinvest's latest list was the M&G North American Value Fund lagging its sector by 42 per cent over the period in question.

Here an investor would now have £107 after investing £100 three years ago - a minute return compared to the better performers in the sector. The GAM North American Growth Fund has also performed poorly 40 per cent below its sectoral average over the three-year period.

Bad dog (still cute though): The overall worst performing fund in Bestinvest's latest list was the M&G North American Value Fund Bestinvest said

The Legg Mason IF ClearBridge Global Equity Income fund leaked value in absolute terms as well as lagging its rivals by 39 per cent.

Looking at the broader picture some fund areas appear to be more prone to becoming consistent 'underachievers' than others.

Some 38 poorly ranked funds are in the global equities sector while a high number of North America funds also scored poorly.

Any bright spots?

In better news dog funds that invest specifically in smaller companies 'appear to be an extinct breed' Bestinvest said.

Bestinvest added: 'While many of the funds in Spot the Dog are Chihuahuas with a third of the funds identified being less than £100million in size 15 funds are classified by Bestinvest as Great Danes each of which has over £1billion of assets.

'These include funds that are widely held by private investors and managed groups such as Invesco St James's Place Schroders and Hargreaves Lansdown.'

The news is also fairly good for UK-focused funds.

'In the latter part of 2020 optimism about Covid-19 vaccines helped drive a rally in some of the more economically-sensitive parts of the UK market that had earlier taken a beating' Bestinvest said.

'This led to a reversal in the fortunes of some of the funds that experienced a particularly tough first half of 2020 enabling tem to escape from our kennel.

'This has resulted in a far improved picture in this edition with just seven UK All Companies funds meeting our dog criteria'.

The Liontrust UK Ethical fund was a very strong performer providing a relative three-year return of 37 per cent.

The LF Lindsell Train UK Equity fund and the TB Evenlode Income funds were also good performers.

My returns are dire - what should I do?

Well your first instinct might be to panic. But it's better to take time to delve deeper into how your funds are working (or not) for you and think about where you may want to shift your cash.

Jason Hollands managing director at Bestinvest said: 'If your savings are tied up in an investment fund that is repeatedly delivering worse returns than the market it invests in then you really owe it to yourself to take a closer look and think about whether you might be better off moving it elsewhere.

'The differences between the best and worst performing funds are enormous so it is essential to choose funds very carefully and then keep a beady eye on them or opt for low-cost trackers instead.

'The latter won't beat the returns of market but will closely mimic them.'

Mr Hollands stresses that it can be more difficult than you think to identify a 'dog fund.'

He said: 'Recognising that you might have your money invested in a dog-fund is not as straight-forward as you might think.

'While 32 of the funds in the report actually lost investors’ money over the last three-years – the worst by 42 per cent - most of them didn’t.

'That’s because stock-markets in general have delivered very strong returns over the last decade and so nearly all ships have been lifted by the rising tide even those with leaks in their hulls.

'If the value of your investments has gone up over the years it is easy to assume that the fund manager has done an OK job. In reality their decisions may not be adding any value whatsoever though you’ll be paying them fees nevertheless.”

'Of course the past is not the future and there can be times when it might be worth hanging on.

'For example if a new manager with a better track record has recently been put in charge or because you believe an approach that has been out of favour is about to make a come-back.

'However if you really cannot find a convincing reason to stay put in an investment also-ran then moving elsewhere could give your Isa or pension a new lease of life.'

Be mindful of any fees involved when picking a new fund to plough your cash in and make sure you regularly monitor its performance.

While investors who entrusted the disgraced stock-picker with their savings have lost more than £1billion the once-feted fund manager will be rebuilding his career from Grade I-listed Marlow Place described as the town's 'most flamboyant house' by the local preservation society.

With its bright white cornicing and wood-panelled rooms it is in stark contrast to the dull Oxford business estate from which Woodford ran his former investment empire.

Lording it up: Neil Woodford and the Grade-I listed Marlow Place

According to commercial property consultants Exeid which manages the building other offices for let in the five-storey Marlow Place range from a 600sqft loft with space for eight desks and costs £4000 per month to a 250 sqft office for four desks costing £1600 per month.

The distillery of local spirit-maker Marlow Gin is in the mansion's outbuildings. A spokesman for Woodford declined to comment on the office or how much space was being rented.

The site is a throwback to Woodford's early days as an investment manager at Perpetual now part of Invesco which then operated from the Grade II-listed Old Rectory in Henley. Woodford built his reputation over 25 years at Invesco. But he left to set up Woodford Investment Management with his right-hand man Craig Newman in 2014. The firm collapsed in 2019 after a run of poor performance which led to the implosion of his £3.7billion Equity Income Fund.

Flamboyant: King George II

Last weekend he angered savers still smarting from his mistakes by announcing an audacious comeback. His new firm WCM Partners will be based in Jersey though the main office will be in Marlow Place.

Rather than pulling in money from ordinary savers it will target professional and ultra-wealthy investors as it aims to build a portfolio of biotech stocks.

Jersey's financial regulator said this week that it was 'disappointed' to see Woodford unveiling his plans to base his business on the island when he hadn't even made an application for authorisation yet.

UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority said WCM would have to seek it authorisation if it wanted to do any business in the UK and it would consider the 'fitness of its management' before granting approval."

(WLUC) - Larry Gereau a retired U.S. Navy veteran traveled a long way to get a free filling at The John Fornetti Dental Center in Iron Mountain.

“I traveled in from Gladstone” he said. “That’s 50 miles but I would never hesitate to do it.”

On Saturday Gereau was among dozens to receive free dental care at the 15th Annual Dentistry from the Heart event. Clients who are 18 & older stopped by to receive a free cleaning filling or extraction.

Dr. John Fornetti says the event is a nice way to give back to the community.

“The entire Upper Peninsula and northeastern Wisconsin really has helped us in our career here” Fornetti said.

This is also the first time Dentistry from the Heart is named after Dr. Fornetti’s childhood friend Don Roberts. Before passing away in 2020 Roberts who loved the event left a generous donation.

“We were touched by that” said Fornetti. So we decided from now forward it’s going to be the Don Roberts Memorial.”

For the 14th straight year the dental center has partnered with The Drug Store to give free prescriptions to patients after the conclusion of their appointments.

“We call them and let them know ‘So-and-so is coming over. This is the prescription’” Fornetti explained. “And by the time [the patients] get over there they fill the prescriptions for them. I think it’s a wonderful service they provide as well.”

Gereau says he plans to return next year.

“They really care about you” he stated. “When you get done you feel like you’re a friend of theirs.”

Plus this also includes a guide on how to find every metal on ""Valheim.""

'Skyrim' in 'Valheim'

In a report by ScreenRant as ""Valheim"" players begin to show their creative side through the game one player caught the attention of the world especially both ""Valheim"" and ""Skyrim"" fans thanks to a recreation of the latter title's High Hrothgar monastery

The creation was done by Reddit user McBadWorld who even created the interior as closely as possible to the specifics by Bethesda.

How to Find Every Ore In-Game

Meanwhile here's a guide for every player who might be stuck in the game.

Specifically here's a guide to finding and getting every type of metal on ""Valheim"" including silver iron copper tin black metal scraps and obsidian which help create a variety of gears and weapons that could be useful in the game especially when taking down bosses.

How to Find and Smelt Copper

First of all copper is a common resource found in the Black Forest biome as per IGN.

To get copper look for massive rocks covered in moss that has copper-colored little inclusions in them then it should read ""Copper Deposit"" and if it does you know you got the right rock.

Use an Antler Pickaxe or something better to mine it.

Be sure that you keep on mining even if it seems you've mined all the copper since Copper ore frequently are deep beneath the rock plus you also get Stone while mining for this resource.

To smelt a single Copper bar players will need x2 Coal and x1 Copper but once you have a Copper bar you can use it to craft a Copper Knife Sconce Bronze Forge and a Forge Cooler.

How to Find and Smelt Tin

Tin can also be found in the Black Forest biome whenever players explore the shorelines and riverbanks within the specific location. Look for small rocks that have a streak of black through them.

Again this will require an Antler Pickaxe or something better to mine it.

To smelt a single Tin ingot ""Valheim"" players need x1 Tin and x2 Coal and once you have a Tin ingot you can craft either a Cauldron or Bronze.

How to Find and Smelt Iron

For the Iron ore players need to go to the Swamp biome.

It can be found in two ways: first finding the hidden Muddy Scrap Piles throughout the Swamp with the help of a Wishbone which could be found by defeating Bonemass one of ""Valheim's"" bosses.

The Wishbone will pulsate stronger with louder pinging noises once you're near the Muddy Scrap Piles that contain Iron.

Nevertheless Muddy Scrap Piles can also be found more reliably on the Sunken Crypts but entering one will require a Swamp Key which can be acquired by defeating The Elder the game's second boss.

Muddy Scrap Piles often block doorways within the crypts but they can also be a rare drop Oozers and mining Meteor Craters.

To mine Scrap Iron from the Piles players need an Antler or Bronze Pickaxe and when smelting the resource to a single Iron bar players need x2 Coal and x1 Iron.

How to Find Silver

When it comes to finding a Silver ore players need to go to the Mountains biome and mine deposits that are typically hidden underground and will typically require the Wishbone although there are rare Silver veins found on the surface of mountain tops that can be found without the item with a full guide from Tech Times.

Once the Wishbone you equip pulsates stronger and has a louder pinging noise start mining the ground underneath you.

Moreover only choose larger Mountain biomes since small ones won't have Silver ores.

How to Find Obsidian

Obsidian can also be found on Mountain biomes and by mining the black rocks found on top of the mountains.

The rocks are easier to find since they are above the ground but you do need an Iron Pickaxe to mine an Obsidian ore but it's worth getting the resource as it's useful for crafting a Tool Shelf Frost Arrow Poison Arrow and an Obsidian Arrow.

How to Find and Smelt Black Metal Scraps

Unlike other ores in the list Black Metal Scraps can only be dropped by Fulings as of now so find some of these goblin-like creatures in the Plains biome as well as along the Meadows and the Black Forest at night after defeating Yagluth to collect them.

To smelt a Black Metal Ingot you will need x2 Coal and x1 Black Metal Scrap.

A Black Metal Ingot can be used to craft a Blackmetal Sword Blackmetal Atgeir Blackmetal Shield Blackmetal Axe Blackmetal Tower Shield and a Blackmetal Knife in ""Valheim.""

Here’s our guide to help you out.

Note: Valheim is currently an Early Access title. As such mechanics and content may change in due course. For more information check out our Valheim guides and features hub.

Valheim boss guide: Where to find Dragon Eggs and how to defeat Moder

Getting started: Moder’s location and ideal gear

First things first: you’re going to be in trouble in Valheim‘s Mountain biome if you don’t ferment some frost resistance mead to counter the freezing effects in the region. Once you can practically survive you can traverse the snowy peaks in search of obsidian silver and Wolf Armor. In fact I consider the Wolf Armor set pretty decent — the chest piece and cloak each provide the same frost resistance buff so you won’t need to chug mead every 10 minutes. As for weapons you could opt for an Iron Mace and Silver Shield or the Draugr Fang and some obsidian arrows.

Regarding Moder’s location it’ll always be random due to procedural generation and map seeds. More often than not though it’d be at the highest peak of the mountain range. Likewise you could search stone buildings in the region to find a runestone that reveals the altar.

The Dragon Egg altar sacrifice

This boss in Valheim requires 3x Dragon Eggs as a sacrifice. That’s easier said than done because each Dragon Egg has a 200-point carry weight. Even with the Megingjord equipped you can only carry a maximum of two Dragon Eggs at any given time due to their weight. Likewise they’re also scattered all over the Mountain biome but you can open the world map and double-click to add a marker just so you’d remember these spots.

Unfortunately getting around in this region can be tricky. You can’t fast travel via portals you construct in Valheim if you have a Dragon Egg in your inventory. However you can place these on transport carts along with other materials. The downside is that the cart’s destruction (through various means) could lead to storage boxes getting crushed. This can also destroy the Dragon Egg in the process. As such you can expect a lot of backtracking.

Alternatively you can push onward until you find Moder’s altar then check if any eggs are nearby. Just bring those to the altar rather than going all over the place.

Moder’s attacks and abilities

Like other bosses in Valheim Moder will swipe at you if you’re too close while she’s on the ground. She also has a few unique capabilities:

Flying and grounded phases – Moder alternates between flying in the air and staying on the ground.

Crystalline Shower – Moder only does this attack while airborne. Multiple crystals will drop close to or on top of you but you can run away to avoid them.

Freezing Breath – Moder only does this while grounded. She’ll spew a stream of extreme cold but you can dodge sideways then hack at her neck.

Slowed Down – If either the Crystalline Shower or Freezing Breath hits you your movement speed will be temporarily slowed down.

Anyway what makes Moder such a hilarious boss to fight in Valheim is that the encounter’s ridiculously easy. When she’s airborne you can safely run away from the Crystalline Shower and wait until she’s about to land. Once she’s on the ground that’s technically the ideal DPS phase.

You can either get up close and personal with your melee weapons just make sure to dodge her swipes and Freezing Breath. Alternatively you can bring a lot of arrows to snipe her with since Moder’s movement on the ground is extremely clunky. She’ll often get stuck as though her legs turned to ice. This opens her up to getting pelted with a lot of arrows.

The only challenge seems to come from random enemies that might pop up from time to time (i.e. drakes or wolves). Thankfully unlike The Elder or Bonemass this ice dragon doesn’t summon an entire horde.

In a short while you’ll be able to defeat Moder without any hassles.

Moder’s loot and Forsaken Power

After you’ve eliminated Moder you’ll get the following loot:

10x Dragon Tear – The primary use of this material is to construct an Artisan Table. This lets you craft spinning wheels (flax and linen) windmills (barley) and blast furnaces (black metal). The resources are all farmed in Valheim‘s Plains biome and its Fuling Villages.

Moder Trophy – Hang this on the correct summoning stone pillar to obtain Moder’s Forsaken Power. This ability ensures that your ships sail with a tailwind allowing you to travel effortlessly through the high seas (at least for five minutes).

Valheim is available on Steam as part of the Early Access program. For more information check out our guides and features hub.

For the Daily Commercial

Although only in the Marine Corps for a little more than two years Jacob Hobby 24 has already had some milestone experiences.

Hobby was born in Altamonte but grew up mainly in Tennessee before moving back to Florida in 2017 after his father David took over the family business - Jean’s Furniture & Mattress Center - which was owned by Jacob’s grandfather Allan.

Jacob was attending college when he made the decision to enlist in the Marine Corps.

“I just wanted to go out and see the world and do something different with my life” Jacob said. “My grandfather on my mom’s side was a Marine and I just knew that was where I wanted to be.”

However stepping foot for the first time at Parris Island Jacob thought to himself “What have I gotten myself into?

“It was definitely a culture shock” he said. “If you’ve seen any boot camp movie it’s 10 times harder. But you get into it and it’s not that bad.”

From there Jacob was sent to Camp Geiger in North Carolina for Marine Combat Training. He currently serves as a field radio operator in support of artillery.

In 2019 Jacob was deployed to Okinawa Japan where he participated in the largest group training project since World War II.

“It was a 35-day exercise up a mountain called the Northern Viper” Jacob said. “Several thousands of us went up in the mountains and had to survive in the elements. We had dome tents and a little heater for like 12 people and no cell phones. It was 35 days of isolation in subzero temperatures to train for cold weather and shooting artillery in extreme weather conditions. I’ve been told it was the largest exercise since WWII. It was crazy but probably the best experience I’ve had so far.”

Pandemic delayed Jacob's return home

Jacob was supposed to return home in early 2020 but the pandemic delayed his return three months.

“They weren’t letting anyone travel and when we finally did come home I couldn’t leave my room for two weeks” he said.

Jacob is currently stationed at Twentynine Palms California and said that he has learned a lot from his time so far.

“I’ve learned how to lead and how to really think on my feet” Jacob said. “Also creative problem solving and to put others before yourself. I’ve met a lot of great people but honestly it’s the people back home that keep me going. When I come back to Eustis I’m pushed by the older veterans to carry on the tradition of serving our country and that keeps me motivated.”

As for future plans Jacob hopes to get a degree in political science and attend law school.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjM3NTY2Ny9saXR0bGUtcGVvcGxlcy1qYWNvYi1yb2xvZmYtaXNhYmVsLWlnbm9yZWQtYmlydGhkYXktZmFtaWx5LWZldWQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMzc1NjY3L2xpdHRsZS1wZW9wbGVzLWphY29iLXJvbG9mZi1pc2FiZWwtaWdub3JlZC1iaXJ0aGRheS1mYW1pbHktZmV1ZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Little People’s Jacob Roloff’s wife Isabel ignored on 25th birthday amid family feud as fans say ‘she deser...,"BIG SNUB!

LITTLE People Big World star Jacob Roloff's wife Isabel was ignored on her 25th birthday amid an ongoing family feud as fans say ""she deserves better.""

Jacob 23 and Isabel have not been seeing eye-to-eye with his brother Jeremy 30 and his wife Audrey 28 over their differing political views.

And now fans have flocked around Isabel after Janae K - Jeremy's close friend when he had broken up from Audrey - was the only person to publicly send her birthday wishes.

Redditors rushed to show their support for Isabel who has spoken out about her issues with depression.

The rallying from fans came after Isabel posted an image Janae had sent her for her birthday which described her as a ""remarkable human.""

The post read: [sic] ""It's one of my favorite humans birthdays today! She has walked with me through very difficult seasons & always remained steadfast in her love and support.

""She is kind & fierce & beautiful & talented & all things lovely. She is real & raw about the hard things in life.""

Janae continued: ""She calls the people around her to love deeper & purer.

""You are a remarkable human Isabel. Happiest Birthday Sister! Love you forever.""

Isabel replied: ""Love you Janae!!!""

Isabel recently sent out a cryptic message on social media about how the long-running feud with Jeremy and Audrey has left her feeling anxious.

She concluded: ""An obvious sign I should pull back. Just going to take it day by day - love y'all.""

Her post last month came after she wrote on Instagram last year “you’re only as pretty as you treat people” amid her feud with sister-in-law Audrey.

Jacob unfollowed Audrey after years of disagreements over politics.

Audrey who has a Christian blog and podcast reposted her brother's video about unity amid the George Floyd protests to her Instagram Stories.

Jacob - who has showed his support for Black Lives Matter by attending multiple protests with Isabel - called the video ""police propaganda” and said it was “not activism.”

Audrey posted the next day that she was “weathering a shame storm.”

The Trinity Long Room Hub Arts & Humanities Research Institute recently hosted a panel on “Migration and its Artistic Representation”. While this was an examination of the subject in its contemporary context it prompts mention of a 20th-century example of the subject – and perhaps one of the most perfect – which was painted in New York in the early 1940s and is little known outside America.

Now titled The Migration Series it depicts the movement of vast numbers of African-Americans from the rural south in America to the urban north in the course of the early 20th century identifying its causes and its consequences.

The African-American artist Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000) a son of migrant parents lived much of his life in Harlem. Speaking later in life about of the poverty of the tenement homes in New York he revealed how these poor living quarters inspired him to become an artist. It was only in retrospect he said that he realised he had been surrounded by art when he was growing up. Visualising this experience he painted an image of nine black figures sleeping side by side in a bleak room enlivened only by the nine richly-coloured blankets covering them.

A school drop-out in the late 1920s Lawrence turned early to art. His unique style – not devoid of influence from the art he saw in galleries in New York at the time – was quickly recognised. Interested in black history he embarked on a series of paintings of African-American activists (Toussaint L'Ouverture Frederick Douglas and Harriet Tubman) before tackling more recent history learned initially from the narratives he heard recounted in his neighbourhood the stories of how many of the people in Harlem came to be there.

READ MORE

Realising these stories were not confined to the people of his particular area Lawrence sought to find out more in his local library the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library the same library used later by James Baldwin. Dedicated to black history and literature the library is now known as the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Lawrence's questions were many – what had caused the migration; how did the migrants travel and to what different locations; what conditions did they find on their arrival; in what way did they benefit by the move and what did they leave behind.

Newspaper archives proved to be one of the most useful resources for Lawrence. Having served originally as a source of information for the migrants in their endeavour the newspapers form part of their story and therefore appear in several of the paintings.

Lawrence’s research resulted in his depiction over a series of 60 paintings what has now come to be known as the Great Migration.

Lawrence conceived of the work as a story identifying the titles of each of the painting before considering their composition. Since the migration began during the first World War the first painting in the series shows a large gathering of figures at a railway station buying train tickets for Chicago New York and St Louis.

The train station makes regular appearances throughout the series indicative of the mass movement of people and their principal mode of transport. The 60 paintings are small uniform in size (12 x 18 ins; 30 x 45 cms) in both landscape and portrait format (horizontal and vertical) and retain a stylistic unity in colour and pattern.

Completed in 1941 the series was shown at the Downtown Gallery in New York having already caused something of a sensation by receiving considerable coverage in Fortune Magazine a month earlier.

Subsequently the series went on tour in the US returning to be exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1944.

By this time the paintings had been sold not to one individual or gallery but more unusually they were to be shared by two prime collections of modern art in America MoMA and the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. Rather than split down the middle the series was divided into even (MoMA) and uneven (Phillips) numbers.

Since 1944 the two collections have only been brought together for exhibition on two occasions – and have never been seen outside the US.

In 1993/95 the 60 paintings were shown together again at MoMA. It was on this occasion that many of the titles were changed to incorporate the term African American.

All 60 painting were exhibited again in 2016/17 in Washington on which occasion I was fortunate to see the whole series in the Phillips Collection. I had previously known nothing of Jacob Lawrence and was scarcely more familiar with the subject of his paintings.

Isabel Wilkerson in her book The Warmth of Other Suns (2010) has described this migration as the biggest underreported story of the 20th century in the US.

While Lawrence was necessarily only depicting the subject up to the beginning of the 1940s the migration was to continue into the 1970s.

By then in America some six million black southerners had left the land of their birth and moved to the industrial north in search of a better life.

The last painting in Lawrence’s series painting number 60 titled And the Migrants Kept Coming shows a richly colourful gathering of people of all ages waiting on as station platform with their luggage for the train to take them to their new life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2xvbmctaXNsYW5kL2xlYWRpbmctdGhlLXdheS1hZnJpY2FuLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1zaGFyZS1leHBlcmllbmNlcy1vZi1tYWtpbmctYS1kaWZmZXJlbmNlLWUzODEzOdIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL2FtcC9sb25nLWlzbGFuZC9sZWFkaW5nLXRoZS13YXktYWZyaWNhbi1hbWVyaWNhbnMtc2hhcmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZXMtb2YtbWFraW5nLWEtZGlmZmVyZW5jZS1lMzgxMzk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leading the way: African Americans share experiences of making a difference,"Black History Month is more relevant than ever. After a year when race dominated the national conversation in a way not seen since the 1960s there’s soul searching and a quest for knowledge and understanding. You can only walk in your own shoes but a good second best is someone else’s story.

History is made in tiny steps and giant leaps. On Long Island there are Black leaders making a difference one day at a time. They courageously take on such issues as social justice health and education disparities voting rights affordable housing economic empowerment — and that’s just the beginning.

Tracey Edwards the Long Island regional director for the NAACP has long advocated for civil rights. Don’t call her a hero though. ""I want to be remembered as someone that stood up and spoke up for what is right and what is just at every opportunity"" she said.

Edwards is quick to praise others ""In this unprecedented time of economic challenges COVID civil unrest health and educational disparities those working on these issues are heroes.""

Jacob Dixon

Jacob Dixon knows what it’s like to need services. Growing up he had a learning disability. His Roosevelt public school didn’t have the services he required so he also attended a primarily white school in East Williston. ""It was the tale of two worlds. It wasn’t a private school but there they [my parents] advocated for me to get what I needed"" said Dixon.

That experience planted his advocacy seeds. During undergraduate studies at Penn State he worked for a Manhattan nonprofit providing student leadership development and advocacy in higher education and as a special-education teacher at a New York City charter school through Teach for America.

In 2011 from his parent’s basement he started Choice for All a nonprofit that now has 15 programs serving 150 children and families in Roosevelt and 22 ZIP codes. Among the programs is JumpStart Learning Hub which provides academic support virtually and in-person after school. Choice for All also provides advocacy for parents of children with disabilities working directly with school districts to increase access to quality education. There’s also youth entrepreneurial program that runs a community farm stand in Roosevelt and Hempstead to increase affordable healthy food options.

Choice for All directly supports those in need with onetime grants for fuel and utilities and vouchers for bus transportation. Its community-led campaigns focus on education justice health equity and income stability. Inspired by Civil Rights activist Dorothy Cotton Dixon’s Action Center offered information online during the 2020 election on voter registration as well as quick webinars on absentee ballots early voting and the ballot.

What has Dixon smiling these days? Dancing West African and salsa collecting Black and Latinx art and being an uncle to seven nieces and a nephew. By early 2022 his organization will move to the Hagedorn Hub a three-story center for family and social justice organizations Choice for All has built on North Main Street in Freeport with funding from Hagedorn Foundation. Until the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 the building’s ownership was restricted to a white person making the acquisition sweeter said Dixon.

The 34-year-old Roosevelt resident refers to the children in his program as his kids. ""This work is exciting but trying"" he said. ""There is a lot of emotional labor. You need emotional armor. But it’s not about me. I stand up for them and stand beside them.""

Elaine Gross

ERASE Racism is marking its 20th year of working to eliminate barriers to racial equity. Founder and president Elaine Gross leads the organization that spotlights and exposes structural racism particularly in housing and public schools through research policy advocacy legal action and education.

The Syosset organization’s work has amended and strengthened local fair housing laws. Victories include successful litigation in Nassau and Suffolk counties against property owners and management companies that discriminated in showing rental apartments based on race. In 2016 Gross started the statewide campaign that led in 2019 to New York's enactment of a ban on housing discrimination against people who depend on legal nonwage sources of income (like rental housing income alimony and child support) for their rent.

""We’ve made an impact"" Gross said noting that the battle is far from over. ""We have to keep going I literally feel like I have no choice. I must do all that I can because of all that was done in the past. I owe it to my ancestors those from long ago and from recent years. And also for our collective children.""

Gross 70 lives in Huntington and is a member of the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council as well as other boards. Her many awards include the Lifetime Achievement Award from Long Island Business News. She enjoys long walks in the woods jazz and Classical music.

Reflecting on the past two decades she said ""When two or three come together for good you can do big things. That is the story of ERASE Racism. We have done the work that had to be done even when it wasn’t popular or supported adequately financially.""

Erika Hill

""I’ve been called 'Buckwheat' the N-word followed and accused of stealing a coat in a store"" said Erika Hill.

Through it all she has mastered the art of maintaining her composure — and venting to family and friends instead. In the end she keeps moving and focused. She doesn’t wear that T-shirt with ""Changemaker"" splashed on it for nothing. Hill is the principal of Vision Street Research a consultancy on a mission to provide research that impacts communities. The company which she started in Georgia in 2012 supports minority- and women-owned business enterprises (referred to as MWBEs) especially those that are Black-owned.

Her clients are community-based organizations government entities and small businesses. She has partnered with and been asked to spearhead projects with Chambers of Commerce to help MWBEs.

Hill 40 of Baldwin is a member of the Baldwin Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Coalition of Black Women Businesses. She has worked as the director of programs and community engagement for the Office of the Nassau County Comptroller and as the director of programs at Sustainable Long Island where she led a team that implemented community-based projects including working with stakeholders and leaders in Long Beach and Roosevelt to host sessions in which MBWE attendees got advice and resources about marketing business formation applying for government contracts and more.

Hill teamed with Choice for All and Minority Millennials to encourage young adult minorities to participate in the 2020 census using the social media campaign #OurLivesCount. She created the Eugenia Hill Marketing Scholarship at her alma mater Clark Atlanta University and during the pandemic the Willa Mae Grant for Black businesses.

A recent win was becoming a virtual work site for the Town of Hempstead Summer Youth Employment Program developing and administering a five-week educational and professional program for three minority males. ""I am most proud of it because doing so made me feel like I was honoring the life and legacy of my late father who believed in workforce development. Viewing the final presentations from the students solidified that the experience made a lasting impact on each of them"" Hill said.

She said her close-knit family keeps her centered elsewhere she looks to Madam C.J. Walker a fellow alopecian and the first Black woman millionaire in America. ""She was very empowering to me when I was diagnosed with alopecia areata"" Hill said of the autoimmune disease. ""Learning how she transformed her pain point into a positive flourishing business was exciting for me.""

Hill writes poetry practices yoga plays tennis and ran her first half-marathon last year. How does she want to be remembered? ""As someone who woke up every day wondering how she could make an impact.""

Dr. D’Andrea Joseph

As a child D’Andrea Joseph wanted to be Mother Teresa. She was drawn to the nun’s dedication to altruism. The chief of acute care surgery and trauma at NYU Langone Hospital – Long Island in Mineola said giving back is a must for her.

The first woman and person of color to head her division Joseph 51 said ""I had a lot of help along the way.""

Not only professionally from mentors but from family. ""I didn't want for anything growing up having a fairly privileged upbringing by West Indies standards but when I came here I struggled"" said Joseph. Her parents made financial sacrifices so their children could attend college — and she could attend medical school at Stony Book University and her residency at Brown University. Her brother who lived in Washington D.C. drove to New York so she could use his car for school until hers was fixed. Her sister who doesn’t drive would do things like take a bus from New Jersey to Queens to bring her a blanket to keep her warm when she was a struggling undergrad.

Joseph gives back with lectures on intimate-partner violence and has served on the board of the House of Malta a mobile medical center for underserved communities.

""I love taking care of people it’s my calling"" said Joseph also an associate professor in the department of surgery at NYU Long Island School of Medicine. She learned from watching her mother who often brought home folks the family didn’t know but who needed help.

Working at a Level-1 Trauma Center that treats some of most complex injuries Joseph said she understands the stresses on patients’ loved ones at times giving out her cellphone number to text her if needed. ""I sleep comfortably when I get a text because I feel like I’m connecting with my patients. I feel blessed to help.""

Joseph who trained at the noted Shock Trauma program at the University of Maryland in Baltimore is a member of several societies and serves on such national committees as the American College of Surgeons and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma; she was elected a board member this year for the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Her research includes injury prevention for intimate-partner and gun violence among others. She received the humanitarian award from former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine for her volunteer work in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

Zodelia Williams

Zodelia Williams 49 aspires to be a modern-day Harriet Tubman taking to heart the abolitionist's words ""Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember you have within you the strength the patience and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.""

That’s the positive thinking she wants to instill in the children who cross her path. She is the executive director of Baldwin’s 3 D’s Aftercare Inc. which she founded in 2008 as well as its Empowerment Circle and Community Empowerment Center. She opened a second Empowerment Center this month.

Williams believes children have the right to be free from circumstances or challenges that hinder their development. A single mother of three she understands the complexity of family life; her nonprofit is named for her grown children Dwight Danielle and Daria.

From the outset Williams who got her master’s degree in social work from Adelphi University and a doctorate from Capella University wanted to boost children’s self-esteem and fill in academic and social gaps. Her center offers STEAM (science technology engineering arts math) after-school programs open until midnight a summer camp teen parenting program teen café mentoring scholarships ESL workshops social emotional learning parenting programs Aged Like Fine Wine 55+ Club and more.

Her many programs and services impact more than 200 families. The needs are great. Racism she said ""impacts all aspects of Black and brown life generational poverty violence underserved schools inadequate housing.""

Williams is also a co-leader of a Girl Scout troop a member of the Nassau County District Attorney’s African American Advisory Council. In 2019 she received the Allen Jamison Black Woman That Rock Award and the SBC Women of Distinction Award. Somehow Williams walks 20000 steps a day trekking from Freeport home to Baldwin and back. ""It’s a time for me to gather my thoughts answer phone calls and be still with God"" she said.

The victories keep her going. ""We had a student come in as a cutter and she is now one year cut-free"" Williams explained. ""That is the benediction. If I had to wake up from this dream right now that would be enough.

""When she initially started coming to us she hated it. She was older and hated being at 3 D’s. She would sit in the back and isolate. Now she and I have a relationship that goes beyond our walls and I know that she knows that I am going to support her as long as I have breath. That is a win for us our community and humanity.""

Fred Brewington

Fred Brewington was a second-grader when he was a part of the court-ordered integration of the Malverne School District. ""When I left my Black school I realized for the first time that people didn’t like me because of the color of my skin"" Brewington said.

He’ll never forget that first day at Lindner Place Elementary School. ""There was picketing by the folks from the white community and the press greeted me as I arrived at school.""

The impact was huge. Brewington would take up anti-racism as part of his life’s work in law. Before opening his firm in 1987 he worked with lawyer Vernon C. Mason was a clerk at the Office of the Legal Counsel of the U.S. Senate as well the Community Organization Legal Assistance Project of the National Conference of Black Lawyers and the Community Development Legal Assistance Center.

He’s long been a social justice advocate challenging the ""at large"" voting system in the towns of Hempstead and Islip along with discriminatory practices on Long Island in such areas as affordable housing and employment.

The 64-year-old who lives in Freeport with his wife works pro bono advising community groups and for 30-plus years he’s volunteered as a football coach in the Malverne School District. Brewington has received numerous awards including one from the New York State Bar Association’s Committee on Civil Rights.

Has he grown weary of the fight? ""I’m hopeful. After George Floyd and the protests there is a real possibility for change but we need to go at this with a jack hammer because people are slow to change and systems are slower to change.""

Brewington is hardly finished ""bringing people to the altar"" he said. ""I’m never satisfied.""

Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared on Tuesday to be backing off her threat to force a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson this week though she signaled that she'll preserve her threat indefinitely -- keeping Johnson on a tight leash as he navigates a one-vote majority in the chamber.

The development comes after Greene and Johnson met on Tuesday afternoon -- their second meeting in as many days. The meetings came after Greene said she would force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week.

""I will tell you one thing I did say in there: I am so done with words"" Greene told reporters on the House steps Tuesday afternoon after the meeting with Johnson. ""For me it is all about actions. And that is all the American people care about.""

Ahead of the meeting with Johnson on Tuesday Greene shared her list of demands for the speaker. Her four requests included a return to the ""Hastert Rule"" which means no legislation is brought to a vote without the support of the majority of the majority party; no more funding for Ukraine; defund the special counsel's probe into former President Donald Trump; and avoid a government shutdown before the election by passing a continuing resolution to automatically enact a 1% spending cut.

Greene said she is not imposing a deadline for Johnson to comply with her four ""suggestions.""

""These are not complicated things that we're talking about and having the majority of Republicans support for bills that are brought to the floor. Yeah that's very reasonable"" Greene said. ""It's really simple. It's up to Mike Johnson to be our Republican speaker. And we'll see what he does. And again it's actions for me.""

Greene said she did not provide the speaker with a specific timeline on the demands but said ""it's pretty short.""

​​""That's up to Mike Johnson and it can't drag out"" she said. ""These are things that have to be done.""

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie Greene's chief ally in the quest to oust Johnson said the speaker has been open to the four demands ""but the question is what is he going to do to show that he is moving in that direction.""

At the weekly GOP news conference on Tuesday Johnson didn't rule out Greene's request to defund the special counsel's probe into Trump.

""We're looking very intently at it because I think the problem has reached a crescendo"" Johnson said.

Johnson has already passed government funding aid for Ukraine Israel and Taiwan and even a federal surveillance extension -- meaning that the House is mostly void of must-pass legislation. That gives Johnson the space to advance other Republican-led efforts as the next appropriations battle nears.

Greene has criticized Johnson for working with Democrats on several of those pieces of legislation. Johnson has fought back saying he's a lifelong Republican but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.

The Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson. Trump has also weighed in on Greene's move to oust Johnson.

Trump spoke privately to Greene over the weekend and urged her to drop her push to oust Johnson a source close to the president confirmed to ABC News. During their discussion Trump told Greene that the party needs to be unified according to the source.

The former president's team has mulled over how best to show support for Johnson. Trump brought Johnson on stage at the RNC spring retreat luncheon over the weekend and praised him ""for his leadership and work in the US House"" emphasizing ""the need for party unity collaboration and expanding the GOP's House Majority"" according to the campaign.

House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La. remains House Speaker Mike Johnson. For now.

Despite lots of threats Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. has not yet pulled the trigger on her resolution to unseat Johnson.

Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. huddled with Johnson for a second consecutive day Tuesday. Just last week Greene proclaimed she would initiate her resolution to dump Johnson. But Greene is holding back. Again.



CARDONA GRILLED OVER BIDEN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUTS FOR CAMPUS ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS 'BREAKING THE LAW'

She first threatened to force the House to vote on her measure in mid-March.

""We had discussions in the speaker's office and right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" said Greene.

When pressed when she might make her move against the speaker Greene replied ""It’s up to Mike Johnson.""

There are droves of unhappy House Republicans right now. Greene says she wants to get members on the record showing who is for and against Johnson. Moreover Greene could underscore what is likely widespread support for Johnson. But a prospective vote total on Greene’s unorthodox gambit to pluck Johnson from the speaker’s suite would serve as an important metric. It would serve as a gauge of what could be a cataclysmic set of political events that might unfold late this year and early next. In fact they could paralyze the republic.



To wit: If Greene ever called up her resolution the House will first vote to block Greene from ever offering her motion to ""vacate the chair"" and mandate a new vote for speaker.

Like most things it’s about the math. So let’s explore that for a moment.

Granted there will likely be some GOPers who oppose tabling. In other words there’s an unknown universe of Republicans who would be on the record preferring that the House take a vote of no confidence on Johnson. But the House will likely short circuit that effort.

No things haven’t gone well at all for House Republicans since they won back the majority in the 2022 fall midterms. The House consumed five days and 15 rounds just to elect former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. in early January 2023. And it only took House GOPers nine months to remove McCarthy. That prompted a 22-day interregnum in the House. It paralyzed the institution from doing anything until it finally elected Johnson as McCarthy’s successor.



Rank-and-file Republicans are exhausted by the daily internecine drama surrounding Johnson and Greene. Moreover most House Republicans concede they’ve had it with Greene and don’t want to fuel her enterprises.

""We don't like it. We'd be angry about it because all it does is weaken all of us"" said Rep. Don Bacon R-Neb. ""Tactically and strategically it's not smart.""

Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. had signed on to Greene’s gambit to vacate the speakership of Johnson. But Gosar is suspect about the timing.

""I don’t think it’s going to happen this week"" said Gosar. ""I hope it doesn’t happen this week. So I’ll leave it at that.""

Yours truly asked Johnson about the longstanding threat by Greene.



REPUBLICANS BELIEVE COLLEGE CAMPUS CHAOS WORKS IN THEIR FAVOR

""It’s not good for the country the conference or the cause"" replied Johnson.

The fact that Democratic leaders announced they would try to help Johnson out via a parliamentary maneuver to remove him seemed to pour accelerant on the embers of the House Republican Conference.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said she supported the move by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y. to bring in the Democratic cavalry for Johnson.

""I think he’s very much in touch with our caucus"" replied Pelosi.

I then asked Pelosi what this means about Johnson if he must lean on the minority to cling to his job.

""He doesn’t have to turn to the minority for support"" replied Pelosi. ""The minority party is saying we support the integrity of the House of Representatives and will not let it be littered by nonsense.""

A cynic might point out that Democrats never came to the rescue of McCarthy. But Democrats contend that McCarthy went back on a major spending agreement and spoke derisively of the other party. Yes there are chasms between Democrats and Johnson. But Democrats at least believe they got what they need from Johnson — a bill to fund Ukraine and an honest broker when it comes to spending deals.

However in a Machiavellian twist did Democrats actually stoke more chaos in the Republican Conference by saying they would back Johnson? Hence the reason Greene is now meeting with Johnson on a regular basis? Even if that’s not the intent the outcome is hard to argue with. There’s turmoil among House Republicans now.

Rank-and-file Republicans are also noticing how much attention Greene and Massie receive. They are grumbling about the daily drama.

""You hold a big press conference last week to say you are going to do it this week. And then you go through the same process again"" groused Rep. David Joyce R-Ohio. ""Are we fundraising or are we trying to get something accomplished on the floor?""

Joyce also suggested Johnson might ""create a revolt if he caters to any one group who threatens him.""

As Shakespeare wrote what is past is prologue. And that’s why the bedlam of House Republicans now might reveal something rather jarring about the future when it comes to Johnson any other potential Republican Speaker and the presidency.

The House has now burned 28 of the 494 days since the 118th Congress commenced on Jan. 3 2023 fighting over a speaker. By rule the House can do nothing — absolutely nothing — until there is a speaker. It can’t vote. It can’t create committees. It can’t legislate. It can’t even swear in its members. The House spent five days before it finally elected McCarthy as speaker in January 2023. It was the longest speaker election since the late 1850s. The House then torched 22 days in October after it jettisoned McCarthy before finally electing Johnson.

Here's the problem:

Let’s say for the sake of argument Republicans maintain control of the House in this fall’s elections. If Democrats win the House the party will elect Jeffries as speaker. But if the GOP prevails the path for Johnson back to the speaker’s suite — or anyone else — is far from clear. If Greene ever does call a vote on Johnson we’ll have a barometer to understand the type of deficit Johnson might face in January.

As demonstrated in January 2023 the House is required to vote. And vote. And vote – until it elects a speaker. No other business. Period. And to reiterate it cannot even swear in the members.

Under the Constitution the new Congress tapping a speaker and swearing in members must start at noon Jan. 3 2023.

It took five days to elect McCarthy 22 days to elect Johnson.

The House had time to spare in January 2023. It was coming off a midterm election. It certainly had time last fall.

However time will not be a luxury on Jan. 3 2025 when the 119th Congress convenes.

That’s because the House is supposed to certify the Electoral College Jan. 6.

Congress did not conclude certifying the electoral votes for the 2020 election until the wee hours of Jan. 7 after the riot at the Capitol.

So what happens if the House is deadlocked over electing a speaker and can’t conduct a Joint Session of Congress to certify the Electoral College?

This is the issue that may be ahead if Republicans hold the House and struggle to elect a Speaker.

“I intend to lead this conference in the future” Johnson (R-La.) said Tuesday. “We have plans for the next Congress and we’ve been outlining a lot of that. But right now it’s all hands on deck all hands on the wheel and steering the ship upstate so to speak. So I’m honored to be able to do that. I expect I’ll be doing that in the future and am glad to have the support of President Trump.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9wb2xpdGljcy9qb2huc29uLWdyZWVuZS1vdXN0ZXItdm90ZS1zcGVha2VyL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA3L3BvbGl0aWNzL2pvaG5zb24tZ3JlZW5lLW91c3Rlci12b3RlLXNwZWFrZXI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson and Greene meet again as speaker faces threat of ouster vote,"Washington CNN —

House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene met again Tuesday as the Georgia congresswoman continues to dangle the threat of an ouster vote against the speaker – but it remains unclear if they will reach a resolution that will hold off the vote.

Following their second meeting Greene would not specify when she may force the vote and wouldn’t commit to moving to oust the speaker this week but she said that Johnson has a “pretty short” window to act on a list of demands. A vote to remove the speaker is certain to fail however since House Democrats have announced they would vote to kill her motion.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” Greene told CNN’s Manu Raju. “We’re interested to see his actions not his words.”

The demands she referenced include Johnson committing to the so-called Hastert Rule which states that a majority of the majority have to support every bill that comes to the floor; defunding special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into former President Donald Trump; no more aid for Ukraine; and a 1% slash to the federal budget if they can’t process 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.

Greene said that they are waiting for the speaker to reach back out to them with a response. She added that they didn’t give him a deadline to get back to them.

“We didn’t give a specific timeline but it’s pretty short” she said.

Asked if she still plans to force an ouster vote this week – as she previously had said that she would – Greene said “Well we’ll see. It’s up to Mike Johnson.”

Later on Tuesday Johnson would not say if he would meet the asks.

“We are having discussions. That’s all” Johnson told CNN.

Johnson also called the talks “productive” and said he is “optimistic” they can get to a resolution.

“We’re working through a lot of ideas and suggestions as I said as I do with all members of the conference. That’s part of the process here” he told reporters. “And so I’m optimistic that we can get to some resolutions.”

Johnson and Greene met for around two hours on Monday and after that meeting Greene declined to provide details about what was discussed or say if she would still force a vote seeking his ouster this week.

Johnson has defended his leadership against the threat saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.

On Tuesday ahead of the meeting Johnson emphasized close his ties to Trump and projected confidence saying he intends “to lead this conference in the future” and that he is “glad to have the support of President Trump.”

Johnson insisted his meetings are not a negotiation and that he seeks input from all his members.

“It’s not a negotiation” he said. “Everybody knows I have lengthy discussions detailed discussions on a daily basis with members across the conference there are 217 of us it takes a lot of time” he told reporters.

Trump and Greene have spoken on the phone about her motion multiple sources with knowledge of the call told CNN.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky one of the three Republicans publicly pushing for Johnson’s ouster said he and Greene are giving Johnson “one last chance” to agree to several “suggestions” ahead of Tuesday’s meeting.

“I think Marjorie has been very measured and reasonable about this and logical and she and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he’s going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats” Massie told CNN. “And there are sort of some litmus tests on that but these are things that matter to the conference.”

Republicans voice concerns over empowering Greene

Many Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson not wanting to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.

Johnson briefly addressed his ongoing conversation with Greene during a news conference but declined to give any specific details.

Some Republican House members voiced concerns Tuesday about empowering Greene any further by giving into any demands.

“I think if you negotiate with two members who want something you are going to lose 30 members of the conference who want something else and I think he knows that” Rep. Kelly Armstrong a North Dakota Republican said. “I would always hesitate to agree to anything when you know the goal posts are going to move within five minutes.”

Rep. Carlos Gimenez a Florida Republican said “I don’t deal with terrorists.”

“I don’t deal with people who are threatening me. Never have Never will” Gimenez said. “If I don’t I don’t think he should either.”

But a narrow majority has given Johnson few options in this moment as the speaker wants to avoid the spectacle on the floor months ahead of the election.

“The speaker is dealing in practical arts here not philosophical ones so I am going to stand by him in his decisions” said Rep. John Duarte a California Republican. “I think it is utterly regrettable that these very small minority of members are putting the speaker in this very difficult spot at a time when we should be focusing on the things that matter to the American people.”

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that the speaker simply has “an open door policy” and meets with anybody who has an issue they want to bring to him.

Scalise didn’t want to get into specifics of what Greene and Massie were asking for. But when asked about potentially vowing not to bring up additional Ukraine aid Scalise said that more aid for Ukraine probably wasn’t coming up soon anyway.

“If you look at the last Ukraine bill it took months for that coalition to come together” he said.

Asked if he had any concerns that agreeing to anything with Greene could empower her Scalise said “All our members are empowered right now. It is a time where everybody knows we either all move in the same direction or we are not going to be able to advance our agenda for that particular week. We’ve got to stay united.”

Meanwhile Johnson has been taking steps to reach out to his right flank. Johnson met with the conservative House Freedom Caucus Monday night according to a source familiar. Greene was booted from the caucus in July 2023.

The Village Board unanimously supported a $5.2 million Johnson Controls sustainable energy endeavor that will among many things see solar panels installed atop Village Hall Patchogue Theatre the Department of Public Works building and the Beach Club.

Not only that but three new electric car charging stations and a myriad of energy efficient lighting and system upgrades across the village are also part of the package.

Mayor Paul Pontieri said the Village of Patchogue closed on a 20-year loan through Sterling National Bank this past week to finance the initiative.

The comprehensive project comes as the latest climate-conscious endeavor for the village.

Since the formation of Trustee Joseph Keyes’ Protecting the Environment in Patchogue (PEP) Committee in 2015 the village created a green business incentive program adopted New York State’s buffer in a bag program and implemented a Green Fleet initiative to only purchase electric-powered or hybrid vehicles.

Their first fully electric car of the fleet a Chevrolet Bolt was purchased in December for the Building and Housing Department and Keyes said it should be making its maiden voyage on the road next week.

Dollars and sense

Keyes refers to the Johnson Controls arrangement as “one-stop shopping” as it combines the village’s green aspirations with many energy efficient upgrades to HVAC lighting and temperature control systems.

The village has been exploring the market for solar energy for a few years now according to Keyes but it was not until he and Dennis Smith of the Business Improvement District worked together and reached out to Johnson Controls that they could form a comprehensive and affordable plan.

For any repairs to the village’s utility systems in the past Pontieri explained that the village typically enlisted the services of the lowest builder a collectively costly solution compared to their new contract.

“All of these are just aging but if you do them individually without a real plan it becomes extremely expensive” Pontieri said. “Johnson Control comes in with a plan to do it all to help us finance it and to help us finance at a number that’s not greater than what we’re spending at this time.”

The smorgasbord of renovation is projected to save the village $8.2 million over 25 years by resolving problems Johnson Control identified in its energy audit of the village.

“What’s going to happen in the short term is we’re going to cancel out the majority of that $500000 dollar electric bill that we have” said Smith the Business Improvement District’s executive director. “And with that we’re going to improve infrastructure by upgrading some of the equipment in terms of boilers and air conditioning units and things like that.”

The plan upgrades such equipment as well as lighting and energy efficient transformers in the parks & recreation office Village Hall the Beach Club the Patchogue Theatre and the wastewater treatment plant.

The most widespread of these infrastructure upgrades will see streetlights across the village retrofitted with LED light bulbs.

A pair of solar carports will be constructed in the rear parking lot of the Patchogue Theatre to provide not only shade but also a projected $32000 in annual revenue for the village.

“The carports are actually going to go back into the grid” Pontieri said “And we’ll get a credit from PSEG for the electricity that we supply from there.”

The theatre itself will receive the most love and care of all the village sites.

In addition to solar panels two sections of the roof and five rooftop HVAC units will be replaced and light fixtures both inside and out and the interior ventilation system will be upgraded.

Smith points to repairing the theatre’s roof as an example of a singular project that would have been difficult to fund without Johnson Controls

“That would have to come out of village operating funds” he said. “Now it can be done as a result of the cost saving measures that we have with this green initiative.

“We are not only saving money but we’re improving infrastructure so that administrations in years to come will not have to do this.”

Looking ahead

Both Keyes and Smith said the entirety of the project is expected to take approximately 18 months. On March 1 the pair along with DPW Superintendent Joe Dean and Peter Sarich the village’s senior building Inspector will meet for an operations meeting with Johnson Controls to iron out the plan to move forward.

“We pretty much have a game plan but this will finalize everything” Keyes said.

The meeting will ensure construction and renovation does not interfere with daily life and business within the village.

Smith said the theatre is “something we’re going to put on the front burner” since it is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pontieri noted that the project will leave a decades-long impact on the village and pave the way to a sustainable future.

“It’s about moving into this next century in a matter that takes into account global warming takes into account costs takes into account where we want to be” he said. “It really is about tomorrow.

“We’re going to be a better place when this is done.”

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2hpY2Fnb2NydXNhZGVyLmNvbS9jaGljYWdvLWNydXNhZGVyLWNoYXNlLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1oZWFsdGgtY29sdW1uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago Crusader – Chase Financial Health Column,"As part of an ongoing sponsored series on Black financial health we are exploring the racial wealth gap its impact on our community and what’s being done to address it. In today’s column we highlight the grand re-opening of the Chase Stony Island branch in the South Shore neighborhood and speak with the team on the ground about what this completely redesigned space will offer to local residents. We welcome your ideas and questions to be covered in this series and encourage you to email those questions and ideas to banking@- chicagocrusader.com.

On February 4th Chase held a virtual ribbon cutting event for the Stony Island branch which included JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon Chase Consumer Banking CEO Thasunda Duckett Mayor Lori Lightfoot Alderman Leslie Hairston and others. This is the first in Chase’s more than 300 branches in Chicagoland to feature a new community-inspired model offering free financial health resources like skills training small business pop-ups and fintech innovation to local residents.

Chase invested more than $2.6 million to completely renovate the branch (located at 6650 S. Stony Island Ave. and originally opened in 1994) part of a multimillion dollar initiative to refurbish and repair more than 40 branches in the South/West side and Loop neighborhoods of Chicago. The firm awarded all of the project work to diverse minority-owned suppliers and contractors based in Chicagoland.

We sat down with the Chase Stony Island Community and Branch Managers William Jaramillo and Aneshia Bonds respectively about the re-opening of the branch what it means for the community and how they plan to use their platform to improve financial health among residents and build trust.

Thank you both for talking with us. Can you tell us about the new Chase Community Center branch in Stony Island? How is this different from other Chase branches?

William: This is a new type of branch we’ve renovated with extra space and free enhanced Wi-Fi and technology so that it can be an active resource for the community. Our community room will be a place to host community events financial health workshops like Chase Chats and a storefront that can act as pop up space for local businesses to showcase their products.

Aneshia: We want this to be a place for education and advice. That means giving residents the help and tools to build a budget to save for a down payment or start a business. It’s about community building and making local connections.

This is only the third branch like this in Chase’s nearly 4700 branches nationwide. Why did Chase choose Stony Island?

Aneshia: I grew up just a few blocks from the branch and I can tell you that this is a special community. But this is also a community that’s been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and many local residents need a bank that understands them and can give them the advice they need to get back on their feet.

William: This branch was chosen to be one of the 16 Community Centers across the country because of its historical significance in the South Shore community as well as being a thriving hub for Black-owned businesses. This location has the space needed to continue to engage residents and businesses in this community.

William you are the Stony Island Community Manager. What does your role entail? And Aneshia what are you most excited about for your role?

William: The Community Manager is a new role here at Chase. My role is to help build relationships with local leaders organizations and residents and make sure people know about Chase and everything we have to offer. We’re hiring 150 Community Managers across the country with three to four in Chicagoland.

Aneshia: I’m honored to lead our branch employees who truly make a difference in our customers’ lives every day. Just the other day we received a client letter thanking the staff particularly one of our bankers for his professionalism and all the things we did every day before the grand opening during COVID rioting and protesting. This client expressed how he really looked forward to the added benefits from the Community Center that will help regular clients like himself and his family.

What’s next for the Stony Island branch? Are there upcoming events or workshops that our readers can sign up for?

William: Excited to say that events are well underway and we’re using technology to give us a virtual platform to engage our community during COVID. We will be hosting a minimum of three to four events per month focusing on open conversations about money and credit called Chase Chats in addition to several events in partnership with local organizations. These events will include topics such as budgeting and savings understanding the importance of credit homebuyer education and so much more.

Employees of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden's campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.

Mr. Biden's presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms records show. The companies declined to comment.

The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.

Mrs. Clinton's biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. along with Google Microsoft and Apple according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Four years earlier Mr. Obama's top sources of corporate employee contributions included Microsoft and Google but also Deloitte Time Warner now part of AT&T Inc. and the law firm DLA Piper.

While corporations are prohibited from giving directly to campaigns their employees are free to give as individuals and in the aggregate provide a window into the leanings of workers who are politically active enough to donate across different industries.

The top sources of money from corporate employees to the Republican incumbent Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign were employees of American Airlines Group Inc. Boeing Co. Bank of America Corp. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. according to the Center for Responsive Politics's analysis.

The findings come as Republicans have asserted that the big tech companies are biased against them including allegations that companies with online platforms such as Facebook and Google censor online content to favor liberal views.

""There is a disconnect between the tech industry and many Republicans"" said Doug Heye a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""We don't like Silicon Valley -- and they don't like us.""

Facebook Google and other tech platforms have in the past denied that the politics of their employees affects how they run their businesses.

Some Democrats believe that the companies have grown too large and that their platforms have permitted the spread of false political information that helped Mr. Trump.

Google Facebook and Amazon are already targets of antitrust investigations and there is bipartisan support in Congress for measures that could diminish their clout. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are set to testify before a House of Representatives panel next month.

Mr. Biden has signaled that he supports rescinding the broad legal immunity that tech firms currently enjoy for information carried over their networks.

As the Biden administration settles in tech companies are awaiting key picks for the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division head. The appointments could determine how aggressively the government handles existing investigations or bringing about new ones advisers to the companies said.

The Journal's analysis is based on the latest Federal Election Commission data covering the 2020 election cycle for Mr. Biden's campaign two joint fundraising committees and individual donations to those committees made through the online donation platform ActBlue. The Journal examined campaign-finance data to compile a list of companies whose employees donated the most money.

The analysis relied on a standardized version of the self-reported employer information on each donation and should be treated as an estimate because some of the public records are incomplete or flawed.

Because online donation platforms that itemize even the smallest contribution weren't as widely used in 2016 and 2012 data for previous years include information only on donors who gave more than $200 to a campaign.

About two-thirds of the money in presidential races is donated to candidates from individuals who could give up to $2800 to a candidate for the recent election. Those who donate $200 or more are required to disclose the names of their employers.

While corporations are prohibited from making financial donations to candidates for national office many companies operate political-action committees or PACs which are employee-funded accounts that companies use to donate money to favored candidates. Relatively little money in presidential elections comes from corporate PACs. Labor unions spend millions of dollars each election to support Democratic candidates.

Technology employees made donations to other political entities that worked to elect Mr. Biden and other Democrats including Future Forward USA PAC which spent millions of dollars on the 2020 election.

Mr. Biden's campaign according to the Journal's analysis received $3.7 million from employees of five of the largest Wall Street firms: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. Bank of America Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. In prior elections those firms ranked among the top sources of money for the Democratic presidential candidate records show.

That was less than the total contributed to Mr. Biden by employees of Alphabet who donated $5.3 million making the tech company the No. 1 source of money the Journal analysis shows.

Google employees were the top source of donations to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign and the second-largest source of money for Mr. Obama's 2012 race.

Employees of Amazon contributed a total of $2.8 million to Mr. Biden's campaign. Amazon was the third-largest source of money among companies to Mr. Biden in the election. The company hadn't been a big source of campaign money for prior Democratic candidates records show.

Microsoft employees have long been a top source of money for Democratic presidential candidates. Microsoft employees donated $3.2 million to Mr. Biden in the election.

Facebook employees have emerged as a top source of money donating $1.9 million to his campaign records show.

Other top sources of money for Mr. Biden were employees of Lowercase Capital Oracle Corp. Netflix Inc. Saban Capital Group and Morgan & Morgan the data analyzed by the Journal shows. Lowercase Capital is a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in Twitter Uber Technologies Inc. and Instagram now part of Facebook.

Kimberly - Patricia (Pat) Mary Welhouse Vandehey age 74 passed away on Friday February 5 2021 at Theda Care Medical Hospital Neenah due to complications from COVID-19. She was born on November 9 1946 daughter of the late Earl and Valeria (Pawelkiewicz) Welhouse. Pat was married to Mark D. Vandehey for 52 years before her passing.

Pat had a variety of jobs in her life and retired in September of 2009 from Appleton Manufacturing as a Customer Service Representative/Direct Marketer. She was beloved by her co-workers and although she was very proud to be a working woman being a wife and mother was what she loved.

Pat was a wonderful wife to Mark D. Vandehey and great mother to her four children: Nikki Sharri Donn and Mark. She filled the home with unconditional love that provided everyone with a sense of warmth and a feeling of comfort. Pat was always willing to listen with no judgment. She genuinely wanted to learn about other people and understand what was important to them. Her presence will always be felt through the love she gave.

At the age of 19 Pat worked for Kimberly Clark as a secretary to the Treasury Department. She was very proud of this accomplishment and as a result her first major purchase was a bedroom set that continues to reside in her home today. This set of furniture is beautiful quality built and is a treasure much like she was. It will be a reminder of the standard she set for us. Pat set that standard by being an exceptional person and amazing friend.

Pat was a feisty strong-willed woman with a heart of gold. She was smart hardworking dependable organized and a meticulous planner. She was consistent with her words and stood her ground. A complainer she was not; she was as tough as they came. All of these qualities of strength were coupled with her natural ways of being gentle and compassionate. She loved with her whole heart and instilled the importance of being a good person through her love and kindness.

If you knew Pat you know she loved to spend time with her family and friends read play cards decorate at Christmas time cheer for her favorite sports teams taking long drives with her husband Mark to look at nature and explore new restaurants she enjoyed a good burger; her trips to Arizona with her sister Carol paddles to flash in her car being on the pontoon listening to good music; especially Elvis and buying meaningful gifts which was her language of love. A couple of things you might not know is that she loved her cat Peek-a-boo and liked to follow Hollywood Celebrities and giving an opinion or two. Which leads me to one of her most enduring qualities and that is her sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find someone as quick witted and funny as Pat. She loved to laugh and truly enjoyed life. There is no doubt that Pat our mom(wife) will be missed but she will live in our hearts and memories for a lifetime.

As Pat and Mark grew older their life had shifted every morning they would take their meds enjoy their breakfast and coffee hold hands and say they were going to make that day the best day of their lives. And they sure did try. We will continue with that tradition of honoring her and try to make every day the best day we can.

Patricia is survived by: her husband Mark D. Vandehey her children; Nikki Vandehey Sharri Vandehey Donn Vandehey Mark Vandehey; her grandson Teon Childs her sisters: Jeanne VandenHeuvel (Sara and Martin Jaeger) (Patrick and Jodi Vanden Heuvel) Carol (Al) Schmidt ( Lee and Kym Schmidt) (Kevin and Jodi Schmidt) Mary (Michael) Heesakker ( Justin and Nick Heesakker) Her brothers and sisters-in- law: Dave (Jacci) Vandehey( Brad Vandehey) (Brain and Kelly Vandehey) (Shawn and Kevin Hintz) (Blair and Colleen Vandehey) (Missy and Don Van Krey) Dolly (Ed) Gerhartz) Roy (Catherine) Weyenberg Mary Ann (Ken) Vander Wielen Tom (Carol) Weyenberg Carol (Gary) Mickey nieces; (Linda Vandehey Boschuetz) (Amy and Kip Otto) nephews: (Mike Vandehey) (Steve and Lori Vandehey) and many other family members and friends.

Patricia was preceded in death by her parents Earl and Valeria Welhouse mother and father in-law Donald and Martha Vandehey step-mother-in-law Myrtle Vandehey brothers and sisters-in-law Richard Vandehey Mary Lou Vandehey Lois (Carl) Hietpas Larry Diedrick and other family and friends.

The Vandehey Family would like to extend a special thank you to the staff at Theda Care Covid Unit in Neenah for the loving care they showed her. She passed in the loving presence of two nurses and a doctor holding her hands as she took her last peaceful breaths.

The funeral services will be delayed. An additional announcement will be forthcoming with the date and time of the funeral service.

Kroger is one of the largest retailers in the world with almost 2800 stores in 35 states. Kroger employs approximately 500000 people and had over $122 billion in sales for 2019.

Yesterday Kroger disclosed that they were the latest company to be affected by a security vulnerability in the Accellion FTA software that allowed hackers to steal data from companies utilizing the service.

According to a data breach advisory published yesterday Kroger was informed by Accellion of their breach on January 23rd 2021 and immediately discontinued the service's use.

As part of their investigation into the attack Kroger has determined that no grocery store data including payment information was impacted by the breach. However the breach did expose human resources data and pharmacy records.

""At this time based on the information provided by Accellion and our own investigation Kroger believes the categories of affected data may include certain associates’ HR data certain pharmacy records and certain money services records.""

""Importantly there was no impact to grocery store data or systems; credit or debit card information; or customer account passwords"" Kroger explained in their data breach advisory.

Kroger states that they are in the process of contacting those affected via postal mail. For those affected Kroger is offering a free year of credit monitoring.

Accellion attacks have a wide-reaching impact

Kroger is just one of what is becoming a long list of companies affected by the vulnerability in the Accellion FTA service that hackers exploited over the past few months.

In mid-December Accellion disclosed that they learned of an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in their FTA secure file-transfer service. Threat actors exploited this vulnerability to steal data from companies who utilized the service to communicate with customers and partners securely.

Accellion released a patch on Christmas Day but by the time companies received the update and applied it threat actors had already gained access to their data.

Some of those affected by the Accellion breach have received ransom notes from threat actors demanding payment or their data would be publicly released.

As Accellion FTA service is used by many companies educational institutions and government agencies we will continue to see further data breach advisories released over time.

Previous Accellion-related data breaches include the Singtel QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Reserve Bank of New Zealand the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Office of the Washington State Auditor (""SAO"").",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbWFydC1hbWF6b24ta3JvZ2VyLXBheS0xNS1taW5pbXVtLXdhZ2UtdGFraW5nLXNob3RzLTIwMjEtMtIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbWFydC1hbWF6b24ta3JvZ2VyLXBheS0xNS1taW5pbXVtLXdhZ2UtdGFraW5nLXNob3RzLTIwMjEtMj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart Amazon Kroger snipe over who pays a $15 minimum wage,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Massive retailers have stayed mostly quiet about looming minimum wage increases.

But they have more to say when it comes to taking shots at the competition.

When Walmart announced on Thursday it was raising some workers' wages rival grocery chain Kroger was quick to have a response.

""We welcome Walmart's announcement to bring their average wage up to $15 an hour"" a company representative told Insider. ""At Kroger our average hourly wage has been $15 an hour since 2019.""

""In fact our average hourly associate rate reaches over $20 an hour when accounting for healthcare 401(K) and pensions that so many of our competitors choose not to offer"" the spokesperson added.

Sniping at Walmart is becoming a bit of a tradition in the retail industry. In December Amazon decided to take a swing at Walmart when Bloomberg reported that an Amazon warehouse opening drove down a county's average industry compensation.

""What surprises us is that we are the focus of a story like this when some of the country's largest employers including the largest retailer have yet to join us in raising the minimum wage to $15"" Amazon said in a statement to Bloomberg at the time.

With a $15 minimum wage already rolling out in many states and cities some companies are spending less time fighting new federal regulation and more time fighting each other.

""Generally I think most retailers would prefer wages to be left up to the market rather than legislated for"" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders told Insider.

""However a lot of retailers have been voluntarily increasing wages over the past few years so an increase to $15 is now not seen as such a big deal by some"" Saunders continued. ""Indeed many have raised or are in the process of delivering on promises to raise wages to $15.""

Higher pay for entry-level positions as well as better benefits and other perks typically means companies can hire more engaged workers who are less likely to quit. Retailers raise workers' pay because of regulation but also to better compete with rivals.

""One of the challenges for any retailers is turnover"" Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told Insider in October.

""Amazon has very liberal benefits programs even for part time employees"" O'Shea added. ""Walmart has got college covered. There's all sorts of bells and whistles that the retailers at the top end of the food chain have been able to do because they can afford it.""

""Those people that we're raising wages for tend to have been with us for a longer period of time than someone that might be earning the entry wage"" CEO Doug McMillon said on a call with investors this week. ""We're trying to ... create this ladder of opportunity providing an opportunity for people when they start with the company to build a career like so many of us already have.""

Target minimum wage: $15 per hour

In June Target raised its minimum wage to $15 up from $13. The raise was part of a multi-year effort with the company promising in 2017 that it would reach a $15 minimum hourly wage by the end of 2020.

""Everything we aspire to do and be as a company builds on the central role our team members play in our strategy their dedication to our purpose and the connection they create with our guests and communities"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement.

Kroger minimum wage: Varies by region

Kroger has also faced backlash recently for closing stores in Seattle and California due to ""hero pay"" regulation that would have temporarily increase workers' wages by $4 per hour.

""The biggest issue for many right now is dealing with local ordinances mandating temporary hero pay boosts and bonuses"" Saunders said. ""This is causing a lot of issues and a patchwork of different wage structures. Many of the rules are illogical and hard to implement.""

Amazon minimum wage: $15 per hour

Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2018.

""At Amazon we believe $15 an hour is the minimum that anyone in the U.S. should be paid for an hour of labor"" Amazon said in a statement to Insider on Friday. ""That's why since 2018 every Amazon employee has earned a starting hourly wage of at least $15.""

""It's also why we're calling on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and urging other major corporations to increase wages to this level"" the statement continued.

The Cincinnati-based grocery and pharmacy chain said in a statement Friday that it believes less than 1% of its customers were affected — specifically some using its Health and Money Services — as well as some current and former employees because a number of personnel records were apparently viewed.

It says it is notifying those potentially impacted offering free credit-monitoring.

Kroger said the breach did not affect Kroger stores’ IT systems or grocery store systems or data and there has so far been no indication of fraud involving accessed personal data.

The company which has 2750 grocery retail stores and 2200 pharmacies nationwide said Sunday in response to questions from The Associated Press that an investigation into the scope of the hack was ongoing.

A Kroger spokeswoman said via email that affected patient information could include “names email addresses phone numbers home addresses dates of birth Social Security numbers” as well as information on health insurance prescriptions and medical history.

Federal law requires organizations that handle personal healthcare information to inform the Department of Health and Human Services of any data breaches.

Kroger said it was among victims of the December hack of a file-transfer product called FTA developed by Accellion a California-based company and that it was notified of the incident on Jan. 23 when it discontinued use of Accellion’s services. Companies use the file-transfer product to share large amounts of data and hefty email attachments.

Accellion has more than 3000 customers worldwide. It has said that the affected product was 20 years old and nearing the end of its life. The company said on Feb. 1 that it had patched all known FTA vulnerabilities.

Other Accellion customers affected by the hack include the University of Colorado Washington State’s auditor Australia’s financial regulator the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the prominent U.S. law firm Jones Day.

For Washington State’s auditor the hack was particularly serious. Exposed were files on 1.6 million claims obtained in its investigation of massive unemployment fraud last year.

In the case of Day cybercriminals seeking to extort the law firm dumped an estimated 85 gigabytes of data online they claimed to have stolen.

Former President Donald Trump is among Day’s clients but the criminals told the AP via email that none of the data was related to him. The AP reached out to the criminals with questions via email on the dark website where they posted documents stolen from the law firm.

It is not known if the criminals extorting Day were also responsible for the Accellion hack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjNy5jb20va3JvZ2VyLWRhdGEtYnJlYWNoLWFjY2VsbGlvbi1saXR0bGUtY2xpbmljLXBoYXJtYWN5LXNlY3VyaXR5LzEwMzU2NTMxL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjNy5jb20vYW1wL2tyb2dlci1kYXRhLWJyZWFjaC1hY2NlbGxpb24tbGl0dGxlLWNsaW5pYy1waGFybWFjeS1zZWN1cml0eS8xMDM1NjUzMS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger warns customers of pharmacy data breach using Accellion service,"Kroger warns customers of data breach in its Little Clinic pharmacy

Kroger says the Accellion security breach did not impact grocery data but could have involved personal health and insurance information used at the Little Clinic pharmacy.

Supermarket chain Kroger is warning customers of a data breach in its Little Clinic pharmacy service.

The breach did not impact grocery data but could have involved personal health and insurance information used at the pharmacy.

Kroger said there was unauthorized access to a software they use called Accellion.

Accellion is a vendor that provides secure third-party data file transfer services to over 3000 customers around the world according to Kroger.

""After being informed of the incident's effect on January 23 2021 Kroger discontinued the use of Accellion's services reported the incident to federal law enforcement and initiated its own forensic investigation to review the potential scope and impact of the incident"" Kroger said.

Grocery pharmacies in other chains like Ralph's Harris Teeter and Fred Meyer stores may also have been involved in the breach.

No credit or debit card data was stolen but there is the potential risk of identity theft.

Kroger says at this time it has no indication of fraud or misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

Kroger says it is in the process of reaching out to affected customers and will provide free credit monitoring to anyone affected.

Anyone with questions about the incident should contact Kroger's call center at 1 (855) 558-2999 between 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. PT (Monday through Friday) and 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. PT (Saturday and Sunday).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUva3JvZ2VyLXN1cGVyLWthbGVpZG9zLXNhbmR3aWNoLWNvb2tpZXMtMTQzMTAwNDMwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger Has New Super Kaleidos Sandwich Cookies That Taste Like Fruity Cereal,"From Delish

Kroger’s brand of sandwich cookies Kaleidos have come in a bunch of fun flavors over the years including its sparkly unicorn variety. There’s a new flavor that will remind you of your favorite fruity cereal.

Thanks to Instagram account @i_need_a_snack_ for its heads up we found out that the snack aisle is calling our names. The new Super Kaleidos were made to taste like fruity cereal which leads us to believe that they could have the flavor of many cereals out there. Even more fun than the flavor is the look of the cookies. One of the cookies is red the other is blue and the creme is yellow with red and blue specks.

If this flavor is sounding familiar to you it’s probably because Nabisco’s Oreo released a mystery cookie in 2017 that ended up being Fruity Pebbles. If your memory and taste buds are on point maybe you can compare the two.

“The flavor is a very citrus heavy Fruity cereal that’s more on the Trix or Fruity Loops side than Fruity Pebbles unfortunately! They’re still VERY tasty but the flavor is STRONG which means you can’t eat alot in one sitting the flavor seems to grow it’s a subtle taste you get that initial crunch and vanilla from the cookie and then the fruit comes in and builds till it takes overt the whole flavor profile!” i_need_a_snack_ writes.

The packaging in itself has that superhero theme with the Superman-esque red cape but that’s not the only part that makes it superb. You can head to SuperKaleidos.com to pick your hero to be featured on the new Super Kaleidos cookies. Whether it’s a doctor who’s worked day in and day out during the pandemic or a single mom who’s balanced working and a house full of kids this is your opportunity to nominate three frontline workers who are heroes to you.

From the flavor to the packaging to the initiative behind the whole thing the Super Kaleidos have excelled in being the word “super” in every way possible. Well done Kroger.

Some betting Las Vegas could take esports to new level post-pandemic

Esports boomed online over the past year. It’s unclear whether that success continues in a post-pandemic world but experts see renewed possibility for Las Vegas to take esports to the next level.

“Vegas could become the esports capital of North America” said Milo Ocampo the founder of Las Vegas-based 8-Bit Esports. The 26-year-old Ocampo AKA “kuyamilo” said he first realized Las Vegas’ potential in 2013. “We have the infrastructure set for it in terms of the convention space the tech is here. And the legacy is essentially here.”

Ante: upped

There’s a coin flip’s chance that you’ve played a video game since March.

About 55 percent of U.S. residents played video games during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to a recently released report by Nielsen subsidiary SuperData. The same report found that the games and interactive media industry grew 12 percent year-over-year to a $139.9 billion powerhouse in 2020. Streaming reached 1.2 billion people in 2020 and generated $9.3 billion in revenue.

Esports was a booming industry worldwide prior to the pandemic. People spent more than a billion hours watching online streaming platform Twitch in both February and March of 2020 according to data provided by Rainmaker.gg gaming metrics. That number jumped to 1.6 billion in April.

Then the pandemic hit and people were stuck at home those first few months looking for something to do.

No concerts bars shows live sports.

The lack of competitive entertainment provided esports a window to gain new attention especially as traditional sports leagues and athletes began transitioning their own competitions online according to Brett Abarbanel director of research at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute.

“This just upped the ante and moved everything forward probably about five years just in terms of how it might normally have moved up the trajectory” she said.

Esports reached a wider audience as people sought options for entertainment online. That hasn’t changed with the return of live sports but its growth pattern has slowed as the U.S. approaches a year of pandemic life.

“That incredible trajectory was not sustainable. It couldn’t just go through the roof forever. Nothing really can” Abarbanel said. “But we’re still seeing impressive growth and some plateauing.”

Nevertheless that growth has excited Jud Hannigan the CEO of Allied Esports. His company owns the HyperX Esports Arena on the Strip which resumed hosting in-person events June 25 and now holds three or four tournaments per week.

Since the pandemic the arena has expanded into daily and longer online tournaments to reach a wider audience. Viewership is up 1000 percent from pre-pandemic levels for some of the arena’s online content Hannigan said. The company can now pair its online offerings with in-person events something he sees as a potent combination.

“I think in a post-pandemic world we’ll start to see people flying in regularly for our events” he said “and it’s super exciting for us because we weren’t necessarily there pre-pandemic and now we are.”

Hannigan said the arena’s spring closure provided an opportunity to re-evaluate its offerings. Allied Esports views elevating player profiles as central to its business model. Accordingly the company converted a domed space between the lobby and the arena into a “champion’s circle” complete with a 360-degree LED wall highlighting past and current champions wins and stats.

“If they haven’t come during the pandemic once people come back they’re gonna feel that love” Hannigan said. “And I think they’re gonna feel that that experience is only greater.”

‘This is gonna happen’

There’s a sense of unmet potential for esports in Las Vegas.

Hotels. Casinos. Arenas. Shows. Entertainment. Bars. Nightlife. Experts say the infrastructure is all there for an esports tourist destination.

Yet hotel-casinos such as The Linq and Downtown Grand tried cashing in on an expected esports boom a few years ago and have since scaled back. The HyperX arena’s average customer is 16 five years away from enjoying the 21-and-over kind of gaming that drives Nevada’s economy. They may not be old enough to gamble or drink just yet but they will be soon enough said Chris LaPorte founder of Reset Las Vegas a video gaming consulting company.

“(Las Vegas) jumped into this somewhat early on” Abarbanel said in April. “It’s not that esports is not a success story it’s more that esports is not a success story yet. It’s taking more time to develop what’s right for this city.”

Esports are still a new concept she said last month. League of Legends one of the world’s most popular competitive games debuted in 2009. The industry is still trying to figure out what it is. So are the players let alone the businesses hoping to get in the game for the first time she said.

The industry’s nascency does have “upside” for Las Vegas Abarbanel added. There’s room for innovation and definition in a city with plenty of innovators event space and interest in esports. She pointed to the rapid development of the city into a traditional sports hub.

“In a similar manner we might be able to play host to a major esports event or attract a game developer to set up its headquarters in Las Vegas” she said. “We have a lot of opportunity to be a major hub for streamers who want to set up shop we can innovate in that space as well we can have those sorts of talent agencies.”

Esports in Las Vegas “can become something that does grow quite quickly” because groups like the Nevada Esports Alliance never gave up on the possibility said LaPorte also one of the nonprofit’s members. Online tournaments during the pandemic have at times struggled with bad internet connections and cheating scandals he said.

The demand for large live events is real he said and makes venues like the HyperX arena all-the-more attractive.

“We’re still here saying ‘Hey look trust us. This is gonna happen’” LaPorte said. “We have to just figure out what is going to make it work and how to probably align everyone’s needs to ensure that esports is looking at Las Vegas as a place to hold events.”

Las Vegas hasn’t solved that puzzle — yet.

Bet on potential

Nevada’s public and private leaders see renewed opportunity for local esports to reach the next level.

They’ve viewed the industry in recent years as a way to attract a new generation of customers and diversify and fortify Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy.

A Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority spokeswoman said pent-up demand for in-person events will benefit the valley’s venues that host competitions and conferences. The visitors authority is a founding member of the esports alliance.

Video gaming has thrived during the pandemic and esports’ popularity has provided great opportunity for the valley spokeswoman Lori Nelson-Kraft said.

“Esports fans have shown great enthusiasm for events held in Las Vegas with our 24/7 action and robust entertainment offerings” she said. “The esports industry also allows Las Vegas to attract both leisure and business travelers as we can host tournaments as well as (business-to-business) conferences.”

Nevada Sen. Ben Kieckhefer (R-Reno) is drafting legislation that would create what’s thought to be the country’s first government regulating body for esports.

He envisions a “light touch” state oversight group akin to the Nevada Athletic Commission which regulates combat sports like mixed martial arts and boxing through licensure and sanctions.

Kieckhefer said Nevada has the opportunity to support its most important industries gaming and hospitality and establish itself as a global leader in esports.

“I think the general consensus now is that the time has come for something like this” he said.

The long view

Caesars Entertainment Inc. sees signs that esports events will return and is “involved in a number of conversations at present about exciting new events” said Ty Stewart senior vice president of World Series of Poker and esports.

Stewart said the company believes in esports and thinks Las Vegas “can and will be the de facto home” for esports competitions and festivals.

Esports wagering offers substantial opportunity Stewart said. Caesars is excited about new ways to apply gaming to esports “beyond the traditional outcome markets particularly peer-to-peer gaming on popular titles and streamer betting with instantly served proposition bets.”

“It’s a long regulatory road and most states are focused on sports betting when it comes to iGaming presently but the potential is significant” he said.

Nevada currently considers esports wagers as event betting like wagering on the Olympics rather than sports betting for the NFL said UNLV’s Abarbanel also a director with the esports alliance. Esports betting today requires an application and review process for each event before someone can place a bet she said. The Nevada Gaming Control Board has approved betting on several esports competitions over the past year.

The valley’s inherent advantages as a tourist destination and an “expedited — or overhauled — approval process” could create a unique esports experience according to Chris Grove an analyst with California-based gaming research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

“Everything I see leads me to believe that gambling will play a major role in the growth and development of esports” he said.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Red Rock Resorts and MGM Resorts International declined to comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Boyd Gaming Corp. didn’t return requests for comment.

‘That’s the strength of Vegas’

It will take buy-in for Las Vegas to reach its potential as an esports destination experts say.

Grove said the U.S. is large enough to have several esports hubs each attracting slightly different audiences. Las Vegas’ key will be consistency.

“As Vegas hosts more successful events the city is likely to continue to earn a reputation in the esports community” he said. “Vegas is an amazing backdrop for all sorts of events and that’s the strength of Vegas.”

One hurdle he notes is casinos aren’t necessarily designed for a younger gaming crowd. Esports events must be planned “holistically.”

A generational gap exists between the hospitality industry’s decisionmakers and esports experts said Jairo Urcuyo founder and CEO of esports organization Las Vegas Inferno. A hotel-casino simply throwing a tournament each week isn’t going to cut it; proper marketing and concerted effort to reach a new audience are necessary.

“You’re not marketing towards your regular people who come to the casino and play slots or play poker” Urcuyo said. “You’re not catering to that generation. They’ve got to understand that they’re catering to the new generation that’s up and coming. And a lot of casinos don’t understand that.”

Urcuyo and others highlight an “authenticity” problem that is hard to define but gamers know it when they see it. They bristle at perceived pandering and are skeptical of those who want their business but don’t share their passion he said.

LaPorte with the esports alliance said esports athletes are celebrities with legions of fans comparable to LeBron James in the NBA. Las Vegas already caters to a celebrity culture he said and city promoters must lean into “nerd culture” and attract popular gamers to town; their fans will follow.

“The subscribers to a popular celebrity on Twitch are rabid fans” said Robert Rippee director of the Hospitality Lab at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute. “They consume every word the actions they’re highly engaged.”

“And that is a lesson for everybody on loyalty. If we can achieve that kind of loyalty oh my gosh it’s game over for anything else.”

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

As Nevada approaches the anniversary of the start of the 78-day coronavirus-induced casino shutdown several sources are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.

The only problem is that it’s a really long tunnel.

Last week the American Gaming Association said the U.S. commercial gaming industry saw revenue hit a 17-year low of $30 billion in 2020 off by 31 percent from 2019. Everybody saw that coming and an optimistic point of view would be that now that most properties have reopened and are seeing casino floor capacities raised and customers returning there’s nowhere to go but up.

Look no further than MGM Resorts International for a taste of that optimism as the company last week announced that it is ready to go back to 24/7 operations at The Mirage Mandalay Bay and Park MGM beginning March 3.

While some companies have focused on keeping their doors open and paying their slimmed-down staffs during the pandemic a few have begun investing in new technology infrastructure to better serve customers when they do return.

Boyd Gaming Corp. collaborating with Aristocrat Technologies announced last week that it is on the verge of rolling out a “digital wallet” on a mobile app that is linked to Boyd’s B Connected loyalty program.

Similarly Golden Entertainment Inc. the company behind The Strat Arizona Charlie’s and the PT’s Pub franchise will debut Quick Play with Konami Gaming tying in with Golden’s True Rewards program.

During an earnings call last week Boyd lamented how rough 2020 has been for the company. The strength of Boyd’s regional properties portfolio has mitigated some of the damage hitting the company’s Las Vegas locals properties.

Boyd still hasn’t opened Main Street Station in downtown Las Vegas and the Eastside Cannery on Boulder Highway and the company has been hammered downtown in a market segment that it has dominated for years — the Hawaiian Islanders.

The addition of special quarantine protocols for travel between the islands and the mainland have wreaked havoc with that key Boyd market. Boyd has perfected the pipeline between Hawaii and downtown Las Vegas over time so the return to normalcy can’t come too soon for that company.

Boyd and its locals casino rivals Station Casinos have weathered the pandemic relatively well just as gaming industry analysts predicted. Boyd and Station’s parent company Red Rock Resorts were among the rare number of casino companies that registered a fourth-quarter earnings profit.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season a little more than halfway complete the locals and regional companies are surviving better than their Strip counterparts mainly because the amenities the Strip is so famous for — quality entertainment fabulous restaurants big-time professional sports and renowned spas — are shut down or extremely limited by the government’s virus protocols.

In the fourth quarter the largest Las Vegas companies — Las Vegas Sands Corp. MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd. — have collectively lost more than $1 billion. (Caesars Entertainment Inc. is scheduled to report Thursday.)

The airlines that fly tourists to Las Vegas aren’t doing much better with Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. collectively posting close to $1 billion in losses.

Now we’re ready to turn the page. It appears that state health leaders and the government are finally on track to deliver vaccinations and that the public has become more receptive to getting the shots.

There’s light at the end of that long tunnel. and it’s going to take a little more perseverance to reach it.

LIN,Linde plc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcmF5LWRhbGlvLXBsYWNlcy1iZXQtb24tMy1zdHJvbmctYnV5LXN0b2Nrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Ray Dalio Places Bet on 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks - TipRanks.com,"When billionaire financier Ray Dalio makes a move Wall Street pays attention. Dalio who got his start working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange trading commodity futures founded the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates in 1975. With the firm managing about $140 billion in global investments and Dalio’s own net worth coming at $17 billion he has earned legendary status on Wall Street.

Summing up his success Dalio has three pieces of advice for investors. First diversify. Keeping a wide range of stocks in the portfolio from multiple sectors is the surest way to invest well. Second don’t think that rising markets will rise forever. This is Dalio’s variation on an old saw that past performance does not guarantee future returns. Dalio will tell you that all strong past returns really guarantee are current high prices. And finally Dalio tells investors “Do the opposite of what your instincts are.” Or put another way don’t follow the herd as such thinking frequently leads to suboptimal results.

Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform the analyst community believes they do with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings.

Linde PLC (LIN)

The first new position is in Linde the world’s largest industrial gas production company whether counting by revenues or market share. Linde produces a range of gasses for industrial use and is the dominant supplier of argon nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen along with niche gasses like carbon dioxide for the soft drink industry. The company also produces gas storage and transfer equipment welding equipment and refrigerants. In short Linde embodies Dalio’s ‘diversify’ dictum.

Linde’s industry leadership and essential products helped the company bounce back from the corona crisis. The company’s revenues slipped in 1H20 but grew in the second half reaching pre-corona levels in Q3 and exceeding those levels in Q4.

In a sign of confidence the company held its dividend steady through the ‘corona year’ at 96 cents per common share – and in its recent Q1 declaration Linde raised the payment to $1.06 per share. This annualizes to $4.24 and gives a yield of 1.7%. The key point here is not the modest yield but the company’s confidence in the security of its positions allowing it to keep a steady dividend at a time when many peers are cutting profit sharing.

It’s no wonder then that an investor like Dalio would take an interest in a company like Linde. The billionaire’s fund snapped up 20149 shares during the fourth quarter worth $5.05 million at current prices.

Assessing Linde for BMO analyst John McNulty expresses his confidence in Linde’s current performance.

“LIN continues to execute on its growth strategy to drive solid double-digit earnings growth notably without requiring a further macro improvement. In our view management’s 11-13% guide for 2021 remains conservative driven by its on coming projects continued pricing efficiency gains and solid buybacks with its strong balance sheet and cash flows. Further the solid FCF position provides them plenty of dry powder for M&A de-caps etc. We believe LIN is poised to continue to surprise investors and outperform the broader group even in a cyclical market. the largest global industrial gas company” McNulty opined.

In line with his bullish comments McNulty rates LIN as a Buy and his $320 price target implies an upside of ~28% for the coming year. (To watch McNulty’s track record click here)

Wall Street’s analysts are in broad agreement on the quality of Linde’s stock as shown by the 15 Buy reviews overbalancing the 3 Holds. This gives the stock its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Shares are priced at $250.88 and their $295.73 average price target suggests they have ~18% growth ahead. (See LIN stock analysis on TipRanks)

BlackRock (BLK)

Next up is the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock has over $8.67 trillion in assets under management. The company is one of the dominant index funds in the US financial scene and saw $16.2 billion revenue last year with a net income of $4.9 billion.

BlackRock’s recent Q4 report shows its strength as far as numbers can. EPS came in at $10.02 per share a 12% sequential gain and a 20% year-over-year gain. Quarterly revenues of $4.8 billion were up 17% yoy. The full-year top line was up 11% from 2019. BlackRock achieved all of this even as the corona crisis flattened the economy in 1H20.

In the first quarter of this year BlackRock declared its regular quarterly dividend and raised the payment by 13% to $4.13 per common share. At an annualized payment of $16.52 this gives a yield of 2.3%. The company has kept the dividend reliable for the past 12 years.

Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity Dalio’s fund pulled the trigger on 19917 shares giving it a new position in BLK. The value of this new addition? More than $14 million.

Covering BLK for Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell writes “We view 4Q results as very good with strong long-term net inflows across its products which we expect to continue despite a one-time $55bn pension fund outflow of low-fee equity index assets expected in 1H21 which mgmt. said would have a minimal impact on base fee revenue. Additionally total net inflows drove annualized organic base management fee growth of 13% a quarterly record on annualized long-term organic AuM growth of 7%. We expect organic base fee growth to exceed organic AuM growth coming into 2021 driven by a flow mix skewed toward higher fee-rate products for now.”

To this end Bedell rates BLK a Buy and his $837 price target suggests the stock has ~18% upside ahead of it. (To watch Bedell’s track record click here)

The analyst consensus tells a very similar story. BLK has received 6 Buy ratings in the last three months against a single Hold – a clear sign that analysts are impressed with the company’s potential. Shares sell for $710.11 and the average price target of $832.17 gives the stock a 17% upside potential. (See BLK stock analysis on TipRanks)

AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)

AbbVie is a major name in the pharma industry. The company is the maker of Humira an anti-inflammatory used in the treatment of a wide range of chronic illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis Crohn’s disease and psoriasis. The company’s other immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq were approved by the FDA in 2019 as treatments for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis respectively and saw combined sales of $2.3 billion last year. AbbVie expects that these drugs will ‘fill the gap’ in profits when the Humira patents expire in 2023 with up to $15 billion in sales by 2025.

Humira is currently the main driver of AbbVie’s immunology portfolio and provides $19.8 billion of the portfolio’s $22.2 billion in annual revenues and a significant part of the company’s total sales. For the full year 2020 across all divisions AbbVie saw $45.8 billion in revenues with an adjusted diluted EPS of $10.56.

In addition to its high-profile anti-inflammatory line AbbVie also has a ‘stable’ of long-established drugs on the market. As an example the company owns Depakote a common anti-seizure medication. AbbVie also maintains an active research pipeline with scores of drug candidates undergoing studies in the disciplines of immunology neuroscience oncology and virology.

For investors AbbVie has a long-standing commitment to returning profits to shareholders. The company has an 8-year history of keeping a reliable – and growing – dividend. In the most recent declaration made this month for a payment to go out in May AbbVie raised the dividend 10% to $1.30 per common share. At $5.20 annualized this gives a yield of 4.9%.

Once again we are looking at stock that embodies some of Dalio’s advice. Pulling the trigger on ABBV in the fourth quarter Dalio’s firm purchased 25294 shares. At current valuation this is worth $2.66 million.

Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges covers ABBV and is impressed with the way that the company is preparing in advance for the loss of US exclusivity on its best-selling product.

“Between ABBV’s ex-Humira portfolio’s growth trajectory and a broad portfolio of catalysts across early- mid- and late-stage assets it is hard to find a biopharma company that is better positioned even with their looming LOE. ABBV is prepared for 2023 and has growth drivers to drive better than industry average top- and bottom-line growth in the period before (2021-2022) and after (2024-2028) 2023” Porges opined.

Porges gives ABBV an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating and sets a $140 price target that indicates room for a 33% one-year upside. (To watch Porges’ track record click here)

Overall there are 10 reviews on ABBV shares and 9 of those are to Buy – a margin that makes the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. The stock is trading for $105.01 and has an average price target of $122.60. This suggests an upside of ~17% over the next 12 months. (See ABBV stock analysis on TipRanks)

“I think it’s going to be the Roaring Twenties” Azoff said referring to the lively period known for a good time following the devastation and distress of World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. “I think there’s going to be a lot of pent-up demand and excitement. I think people especially if they haven’t been able to travel take a vacation what a wonderful way to get away for a night even.”

Azoff who Billboard Magazine named in 2012 the most powerful man in the music industry was hesitant to speculate about when a return to live music might come in the United States.

But when it does he has his eyes trained on an area he knows well — the California desert he told The Desert Sun in an exclusive interview.

The desert is of course already known around the globe as a live music mecca because of the Coachella and Stagecoach festivals that draw hundreds of thousands annually with headliners from Beyoncé to Kanye West Taylor Swift Lady Gaga and others.

Azoff is now in the process of augmenting the area’s live music offerings with a privately funded $250 million arena 15.6 miles from downtown Palm Springs that he says will host at least 40 major concerts per year.

He expects the Eagles the legendary group he has managed for decades to be among the first acts.

Azoff who has built relationships in the music industry for decades as the CEO of Ticketmaster and Front Line Management and executive chairman of Live Nation owns a home in the neighborhood nestled across the street from Empire Polo Club the site of Coachella and Stagecoach. The festivals are put on by promoter Goldenvoice which is an AEG Live subsidiary. It is also Azoff's main competitor for artists.

Azoff said that he welcomes Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett and every other major promoter to bring their artists to the arena.

""They're playing all our other buildings there's no reason they're not going to come to the Coachella Valley arena"" Azoff said referring to the dozens of arenas his Oak View Group manages across the country.

Builders will break ground on the Southern California arena in early May and expect to complete the project in 18 months presumably not long after the return of live music.

The arena will be built for an AHL hockey team affiliated with the NHL's Seattle Kraken. Other sporting events including NBA and NHL preseason games college basketball tournaments UFC and boxing also are being pursued.

Azoff 73 and business partner Tim Leiweke who together formed Oak View Group believe the arena that will seat 11679 for concerts will provide the Coachella Valley with a large year-round live music venue as opposed to just three weekends a year for the enormous festivals.

“There’s going to be big demand” said Azoff who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020. “The valley has developed both from its residents and the people who visit there this thirst for music and art. We’re going to provide that opportunity for artists to come play. I believe we’re just big enough that we can be competitive with all the other major arenas in the country and I believe that we’re going to see a lot of music.”

Azoff said that the arena will provide artists with a space to rehearse and test out equipment before heading out on tour up the West Coast and across the country. He also sees it as a place artists will want to come maybe even multiple times a year because of the year-round sunshine and resort lifestyle.

“Residency accommodations” for artists are planned inside the arena which will include a full kitchen and ample space for them to bring their personal chefs and other members of their touring team for more than just one or two days.

Because of the ongoing pandemic Azoff said that artists aren’t currently in a rush to book venues 18 months in advance. OVG booking director Eric Gardner said that it could be later this year or early next year before any announcement is made about which artists will be booked that first month after the arena opens during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Azoff said he isn’t looking for a big opening night. He instead wants a big opening month with major artists from almost every genre and mixed with hockey games. He envisions the Eagles together since 1971 perhaps playing three consecutive nights that first month.

“We want to get it all” he said.

The completion of the arena is still more than a year away but the timing Azoff says is perfect. Entering the Roaring Twenties President Warren G. Harding’s campaign slogan was “Return to normalcy” following the war and pandemic.

Azoff sees live music as opportunity to usher in a return to normalcy a hundred years later and the arena in the California desert playing a big role in that.

“The good news for us in building it down there” Azoff said “is that it appears that by our opening I can’t imagine the business isn’t back at full speed.”

Bon Scott had the voice many people know and recognise from AC/DC’s iconic tunes. He was the voice behind Highway to Hell and Night Prowler. Sadly his time with the band was cut short and the band were forced to find another frontman to take over.

How did AC/DC original frontman Bon Scott die? Ahead of Bon’s death AC/DC had already been through a number of major line-up changes with new bass players and drummers coming and going. The main members remained the Young brothers - Malcolm and Angus - who remained with the band until Malcolm’s illness forced him to leave. But the biggest blow in their early days was when Bon died which surprised many fans. READ MORE: Frank Sinatra nickname: How did Frank gain his famous nickname?

On the evening of February 18 he had visited a London club now known as KOKO and was believed to have been left to sleep in a car by a friend of his. Then on February 19 1980 Bon was found dead in the car but was taken to hospital in London where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

In 1966 The Beatles were incredibly famous but had not hit their stride yet. The quartet had already released albums such as Help! Rubber Soul and Revolver but in the years to come the Fab Four would release The White Album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road. It is because of their fame that the band’s manager Brian Epstein asked Harrison to forgo a large wedding to his bride-to-be Boyd.

Instead of a church wedding Harrison arranged to get hitched to his first love at a registry office in Epsom Surrey and to keep it as low-key as possible. Harrison and Boyd didn’t tell many people and just brought a few close friends to the event. Paul McCartney was Harrison’s best man and Epstein attended the nuptials as well. The other half of The Beatles John Lennon and Ringo Starr did not attend the wedding. READ MORE: The Beatles: McCartney's 'psychiatrist-dodging' song for Tom Jones

Lockheed’s Skunk Works division is known for delivering futuristic aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird F-117 Nighthawk and the U-2 Dragon Lady.

The Maryland-headquartered firm’s Skunk Works division earlier known as Advanced Development Programs is developing an unmanned aircraft system (UAS).

“A secretive new unmanned aircraft system (UAS) designed by the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works is poised to enter ground testing imminently” said a spokesperson from Lockheed Martin.

“The UAS known only as ‘Speed Racer’ is awaiting the pending delivery of engines supplied by Technical Directions Inc. (TDI) a Michigan-based small turbojet supplier that was acquired in 2019 by Kratos Defense and Security Solutions” she said.

According to reports the unscrewed vehicle is set to use an all-new digital engineering process called StarDrive. The digital engineering process involves using computer software to construct “digital twins” of an aircraft from the design to flight stages before the physical aircraft gets ready for take-off.

Through the process engineers can use the software twin to predict how an aircraft will fly make adjustments to it and modify the aircraft design to an advanced level.

The digital engineering process which originated from the civilian aerospace sector has recently been moved to the military domain. The procedure will enable the development to be quicker while also reducing the considerable costs involved in it.

A fine example of this is the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project which took two decades taking a huge number of personnel and financial resources.

The US Air Force revealed that with the help of digital engineering it could secretly design build and test a new prototype fighter jet in just 12 months last year.

Now under the StarDrive digital engineering process an aircraft will see rapid development in the overall design and modifications. It will ensure faster and cheaper development of the aircraft.

It is reported that Skunk Works will build the real aircraft to complement the digital twin. The ground testing of the aircraft will include watching and testing it for reliability checking it for unusual vibrations and carrying notional payloads while the aircraft is static or moving under its own power.

This process will be followed by actual flight testing. No further details have been provided by the Skunk Works division regarding the ‘Speed Racer’ aircraft.

Skunk Works has designed and developed a number of aircraft including the P-38 Lightning P-80 Shooting Star. It also came out with a more advanced class of aircraft including the U-2 the SR-71 Blackbird the F-117 Nighthawk the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II considered the most sought-after fighter jet in the world.

Skunk Works is also known for making drones or UAVs such as the RQ-170 and DarkStar spy drone although the latter got canceled.

Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) has signed an agreement to set up a joint venture with US firm Lockheed Martin to enhance the kingdom's defense and manufacturing capabilities the state-owned Saudi company said on Sunday.

SAMI which is owned by the Saudi state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will own 51 percent of the venture.

'The new agreement will develop localized capabilities by transferring technology and knowledge and by training a Saudi workforce in manufacturing products for and providing services to the Saudi armed forces' the statement said.

The announcement follows the US decision last month to declare a temporary freeze on some arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Saudi is one of the world's largest buyers of foreign arms.

SAMI was formed in 2017 to develop local defense manufacturing help cut spending on imports and create more local jobs. The country's economic plan Vision 2030 aims to localize 50 percent of government military spending by 2030.

Lockheed Martin is currently involved in a project to install a $15 billion missile defense system in Saudi Arabia part of a $110 billion arms package the administration of former President Donald Trump said it negotiated with the kingdom in 2017.

On Saturday Saudi Arabia announced plans to pump $20 billion into producing more of its own weapons and military systems over the next decade.

The country wants to spend at least half of its military budget locally by 2030 the head of the kingdom's military industry regulator said on Saturday.

'We will be investing in excess of $10bn in the military industry in Saudi Arabia over the next decade and equal amounts on research and development' the governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al-Ohali told a defence conference in Abu Dhabi.

He also said the kingdom plans to increase military research and development spending from 0.2 percent to around four percent of armaments expenditure by 2030.

The announcement follows the US decision last month to declare a temporary freeze on some arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)

President Joe Biden announced at the end of January that he would pause the implementation of recent Trump-era weapons deals including the sale of munitions to Saudi Arabia and F-35 fighter jets to the UAE.

Reviews of this sort are typical for a new administration but Donald Trump's administration was doing deals down to the wire including one for 50 stealthy F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin as a side deal to the Abraham accords inked only moments before Biden was sworn into office.

The F-35 jets are a major component of a $23 billion sale of high-tech armaments from General Atomics Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies Corp to the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia signed a deal for 7500 precision-guided bombs with Raytheon

Secretary of State Antony Blinken at his first State Department briefing expressed support for the Abraham Accords granting recognition to Israel from several countries.

'As we've said we very much support the Abraham accords' he said. 'We think that Israel normalizing relations with its neighbors and other countries in the region is a very positive development and so we applaud them. And we hope that there may be an opportunity to build on them in the months and years ahead' he said.

But he said he wanted a 'full understanding' of any commitments that may have been made when asked about F-35 jet sales to the United Arab Emirates and arms to Saudi Arabia.

On a post-earnings conference call with investors last month Raytheon's management said 'with the change in administration it becomes less likely that we're going to be able to get a license' for a direct commercial sale of offensive weapons worth about $500 million to a Middle East customer. Raytheon did not give the name of the customer.

'The UAE will work closely with the Biden administration on a comprehensive approach to Middle East peace and stability' the UAE ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba said in a statement posted on the Embassy Twitter account.

'The F-35 package is much more then selling military hardware to a partner Like the US it allows the UAE to maintain a strong deterrent to aggression.

'In parallel with new dialogue and security cooperation it helps to reassure regional partners' Al Otaiba said.

On hold: 50 F-35s like these had been sold to the United Arab Emirates but that deal will now be reviewed

On Friday it was also announced that the Biden administration would be releasing an intelligence report that concludes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that an unclassified report produced by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence will be made public as early as next week.

'I don’t have an update on the timing' press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday when asked about the coming release.

Khashoggi was writing columns critical of the Saudi government for the paper before he was drugged and dismembered after being lured to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to pick up the paperwork required for his marriage to a Turkish citizen.

The Biden administration has already indicated the president will snub 'MBS' as the crown prince is called and instead engage with his father the 85-year-old Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did speak with Crown Prince Mohammed who as the Saudi Defence Minister is Austin's counterpart Saudi state media said Friday.

Biden is returning to 'counterpart to counterpart' engagement' the administration said despite MBS being considered the country's de facto leader.

The president also announced earlier this month that he will end support for Saudi Arabia's controversial war in Yemen.

President Barack Obama began support for Saudi Arabia and President Donald Trump ramped it up but Biden announced during his visit to the State Department that it's ending.

'We're also stepping up our diplomacy to end the war in Yemen a war which has created a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe' Biden said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guYWxhcmFiaXlhLm5ldC9OZXdzL2d1bGYvMjAyMS8wMi8yMS9TYXVkaS1BcmFiaWEtc2lnbnMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtTG9ja2hlZWQtTWFydGluLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtZGVmZW5zZS1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmFsYXJhYml5YS5uZXQvYW1wL05ld3MvZ3VsZi8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL1NhdWRpLUFyYWJpYS1zaWducy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1Mb2NraGVlZC1NYXJ0aW4tdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1kZWZlbnNlLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saudi Arabia’s SAMI signs deal with Lockheed Martin to enhance defense capabilities,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2021/02/21/Saudi-Arabia-signs-agreement-with-Lockheed-Martin-to-enhance-defense-capabilities on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guYWxhcmFiaXlhLm5ldC9OZXdzL2d1bGYvMjAyMS8wMi8yMS9TYXVkaS1BcmFiaWEtc2lnbnMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtTG9ja2hlZWQtTWFydGluLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtZGVmZW5zZS1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmFsYXJhYml5YS5uZXQvYW1wL05ld3MvZ3VsZi8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL1NhdWRpLUFyYWJpYS1zaWducy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1Mb2NraGVlZC1NYXJ0aW4tdG8tZW5oYW5jZS1kZWZlbnNlLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

When the CASA Women's Shelter sent out a plea for help Thursday saying it had no water because of the ongoing water problems in the city and that six families and children were without water CASA board members Santrice Kearney and Keidra Phillips-Burrell and the Jefferson County sheriff's office immediately reached out to their resources to lend a helping hand.

""Water is a very critical and essential resource for everyone but with temperatures dropping below freezing this week waterlines in homes and businesses were at high risk of bursting"" said Jefferson County Sheriff Lafayette Woods. ""Unfortunately our local CASA Women's Shelter that currently serves as temporary housing for multiple families and children was negatively impacted.""

Woods said he reached out to the Pine Bluff Lowe's store manager Jose Rodriquez who donated 40 cases of water without hesitation.

Rodriquez has been very helpful in the past to address needs for nonprofits Woods said. ""Rodriquez jumped into action and had it ready immediately.""

Lloyd Franklin and Jefferson County sheriff's office Sgt. Courtney Kelly and Deputy Cameron Johnson helped deliver emergency water to the shelter Friday which was just in time as the shelter had just depleted its reserves.

""We were in need"" said CASA Women's Shelter Domestic Violence Advocate Linda Burks a school teacher that works at the shelter overnight on the weekend. ""We are low on everything and greatly appreciate what they have done.""

Burks said the shelter is still in need of items as the water is being used for baths for more than a dozen people.

""We are having to boil the water first to take baths"" Burks said.

Donations can be made by calling (870) 535-2955.

""This is just another example of community coming together when called upon to do so without hesitation and just shows you that even though we are small and our resources are limited people that are in position to donate and provide those essential resources are more than willing to do that in this community"" Woods said. ""We've seen it time and time again and it's remarkable and speaks on the type of community that we have.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcm9iLWxvd2UtY2FsbGVkLW1lbGlzc2EtZ2lsYmVydC1qb2FuLXJpdmVycy1zYXctaGltLXdpdGgtYW5vdGhlci13b21hbi5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rob Lowe Once Called Melissa Gilbert to Let Her Know Joan Rivers Saw Him With Another Woman,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cheatsheet.com', port=443): Read timed out.

As a result they are heavily used in the production of beauty products as well as in fashion and food industries. Right now most lipids come from environmentally problematic petrochemicals. But new processes mean its possible to make lipids from organic materials.

That’s the idea of German startup Insempra which plans to turn oil yeast in lipids on an industrial scale using yeast fermentation factories. It’s now raised a $20 million Series A financing led by EQT Ventures. Also participating was BlueYard Capital Possible Ventures Taavet Sten and Acequia Capital. Notably new investors incliude the venture arm of FMCG giant Henkel Henkel dx Ventures as well as Bayern Kapital and Alante Capital.

The Series A follow an initial $15 million seed round conducted in 2021.

Lipids are used for cosmetic and food applications but Insempra is also developing technology that offers a bio-based alternative to everyday materials such as polymers and textiles. It plans to work on generating ingredients used in antioxidants preservatives flavors and fragrances as well.

Founder Jens Klein was formerly CEO of AMSilk GmbH an industrial supplier of vegan silk polymers.

Over a call he told me: “Lipids typically are either extracted from nature. You harvest the plant or you can produce them petrochemically. We use so called oil yeast. And these oil yeasts are put under certain conditions in our in our steel vessels under certain metabolic situations. Then they produce lipids oils which we can extract later on and which we can sell into the cosmetics and into the food industry.”

He said it’s main competitors are specialty ingredients companies largely petrochemical companies: “I don’t know any other company with an approach like ours.”

Insempra will also produce fibers for use in the fashion industry. “There is a spinoff we’ve done together with Imperial College” he said. “It’s located in London. It’s called Salina and we do the Salina fibers there.These are protein fibers which are spun as normal.”

In a statement Ted Persson Partner at EQT Ventures added: “New technology platforms such as Insempra’s have the potential to dramatically change the manufacturing processes of multiple multibillion-dollar industries developing customized ingredients to fit market needs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9yb2NrLXN0YXJzLXNmLWJheS1iZWFjaC1ob3VzZS1oaXRzLW1hcmtldC0xOTQ0NDE4NC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rock stars' former Bay Area beach house hits market for $15M,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/rock-stars-sf-bay-beach-house-hits-market-19444184.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9yb2NrLXN0YXJzLXNmLWJheS1iZWFjaC1ob3VzZS1oaXRzLW1hcmtldC0xOTQ0NDE4NC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that."

""We need someone in the Texas legislature to file a bill requiring the oil and gas industry to thoroughly winterize all their equipment.""

--Sharon Wilson Earthworks

Winter storm Uri which killed dozens of people and cut off power to over four million Texans at its peak also disrupted supplies needed to keep the state's refineries and petrochemical plants operating. As they shut down refineries flared--or burned off--gases in order to prevent damage to their processing units.

According to the Texas Commission on Environment Quality the five largest refiners emitted nearly 337000 pounds of pollutants in this manner.

ExxonMobil's Baytown Olefins plant in Baytown released 68000 tons of carbon monoxide and nearly a ton of benzene in what it called a ""safe utilization of the flare system.""

Critics noted however that benzene is harmful to bone marrow red blood cells and the immune system.

""There is no safe amount of benzene for human exposure"" Sharon Wilson a researcher at the advocacy group Earthworks told Reuters.

Motiva's Port Arthur refinery released 118100 pounds of pollutants into the air between February 15 and February 18. This was triple the amount of excess emissions the plant reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the entire year of 2019.

Valero's refinery in Port Arthur flared 78000 pounds of pollutants over 24 hours beginning February 15 while Marathon Petroleum's Galveston Bay refinery released 14255 pounds in less than five hours that same day.

Hilton Kelly who lives in Port Arthur told Reuters that there were ""six or seven flares going at one time.""

Wilson said that the flaring ""could have been prevented"" by winterizing the refineries.

""We need someone in the Texas legislature to file a bill requiring the oil and gas industry to thoroughly winterize all their equipment"" Wilson toldEarther. ""The bill probably won't pass in Texas but that will create some more scrutiny about it.""

Earther reports that between February 11 and February 18 there were 174 so-called ""emissions events"" from fossil fuel facilities in Texas compared to between 37 and 46 such events in weeks before the storm.

In addition to the previously mentioned pollutants chemicals released from Texas facilities include over 6500 pounds of the carcinogen isoprene from a Shell plant in Deer Park near Houston as well as an indeterminate amount of methane which is 84 times more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over the short term.

Wilson told Earther that ""in Texas we don't count methane"" in pollution reports.

The release of large amounts of dangerous pollutants during Uri stands in stark contrast with claims by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that alternative energy sources such as solar and wind are responsible for Uri's deadly power outages and that the Green New Deal would be a ""deadly deal"" for the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTAyLTIwL2EtZ2lhbnQtZmxhdy1pbi10ZXhhcy1ibGFja291dHMtaXQtY3V0LXBvd2VyLXRvLWdhcy1zdXBwbGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Giant Flaw in Texas Blackouts: It Cut Power to Gas Supplies,"When the Texas power grid was on the brink of collapse and its operator plunged thousands into darkness it didn’t make an exception for the oil and gas field.

But on that cool overcast Saturday in December the growling of construction trucks and chainsaws drowned out the natural soundscape of gushing freshwater and wind whispering between pine needles on the banks of the Mississippi River.

Goodwin was at this river crossing near Palisade Minnesota to protest the construction of the energy company Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline a $9.3 billion project to carry tar-sands oil ― one of the dirtiest varieties of crude oil ― from Joliette North Dakota to a terminal facility in Clearbrook Minnesota. From there it’s distributed to refineries. Goodwin winced as workers felled a mighty spruce while clearing a 50-foot berth for the pipeline its sappy rings laid bare as its crown thudded to the ground.

“At that moment the tree just spoke to me saying ‘I’m being disrespected. I am medicine. And they’re just cutting me and throwing me aside with no care’” said Goodwin who lives on the White Earth Reservation and goes by the Ojibwe name Gaagigeyaashiik. “I just felt like I needed to go and pick it up so I walked over.”

Without realizing it she’d stepped over an invisible border and had officially trespassed into a construction site. Within seconds half a dozen police officers surrounded her carrying zip ties to arrest her. Video footage of the incident shows her ― bundled in an oversize green hoodie a black winter jacket and matching mittens ― apologizing repeatedly as fellow activists chant “Let her go.” It proved enough to talk the officers down to a misdemeanor citation. She’s due in court next week.

Under a new bill in the Minnesota legislature Goodwin could face much steeper consequences. Had any of her fellow activists caused even minor damage to equipment at the site the bill could’ve held virtually anyone even remotely involved — especially those caught trespassing — liable for the damage threatening protesters with up to 10 years in prison and $20000 in fines.

An activist wouldn’t even need to be convicted of trespassing to be held liable ― an arrest is enough under the legislation.

“It is extremely draconian” said Teresa Nelson the legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota. “We don’t impose those kinds of punishments on people in any other part of our statutory code.”

Minnesota’s bill is tougher than similar legislation proposed in other states but it’s not unique. The legislation follows a model that’s been approved in 14 states and is also under consideration in Arkansas Montana and Kansas. The model designates ― if it isn’t already so ― any oil gas coal or plastics facilities as “critical infrastructure” and adds aggressive new penalties for vague charges of trespassing or tampering.

This special status is normally given to dams and nuclear reactors and allows lawmakers to increase criminal penalties for commonplace protest at these sites such as blocking a roadway tethering oneself to equipment or even just rallying near a company’s property. In many cases any person or organization associated with an individual activist convicted of breaking the law can be held accountable. What was once a misdemeanor is now reclassified as more severe crimes ― in some cases even felonies ― with fines of tens of thousands of dollars and convictions can sometimes carry jail sentences.

The uptick in these proposals is a sign that state lawmakers are using the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot to justify new restrictions on peaceful demonstrations that are meant to prevent protests in the first place free-speech experts say.

“When someone has to weigh the potential of imprisonment for protesting they will really very likely limit their own speech” said Nora Benavidez director of the advocacy group PEN America’s U.S. free expressions program. “These bills are just a chilling effect on protest.”

Imprisoning Slaves’ Descendants Bankrupting Tiny Churches

The similarities among the state bills are no accident.

The legislation is based on a model bill that the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) a right-wing policy shop funded by corporations and conservative billionaires drafted and began promoting to Republican state lawmakers in the wake of the fight over the Dakota Access pipeline project. State disclosure records routinely show lobbyists for companies such as Enbridge Exxon Mobil Corp. Koch Industries and Marathon Petroleum consulting lawmakers on the legislation.

Bills of this type have surfaced in roughly half of states over the past four years but they’ve passed at a more rapid pace since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the country fell into crisis the governors in Kentucky South Dakota and West Virginia all signed legislation in the middle of March 2020.

Some bills have proven too harsh even in states where the fossil fuel industry is most powerful. Louisiana’s Republican-controlled legislature for example passed a bill last May that would have imposed mandatory three-year prison sentences for trespassing on fossil fuel sites. It potentially created a scenario where the state would’ve needed to jail elderly Black women seeking recognition of a slave burial ground that possibly contained their ancestors’ remains. The state’s Democratic governor John Bel Edwards vetoed the bill.

Yet brutal outcomes for typically sympathetic figures have done little to dissuade other governors. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed a bill last month that religious leaders warned could bankrupt “some tiny little church in the middle of Appalachia that’s trying to protect its people from pollution” the Rev. Joan VanBecelaere executive director of Unitarian Universalist Justice Ohio told HuffPost in December.

The Green Bogeyman

That bills are predicated on the idea that fossil fuel protesters are becoming more violent is somewhat ironic. The model for the legislation came in response to the Dakota Access pipeline conflict in which militarized police and private security forces brutalized environmentalists and Indigenous activists who for months camped out at the site of the proposed oil project. At least 300 unarmed protesters were injured in a single day and one woman nearly lost her arm following a crackdown by police. The heavily armed security forces reported no similar injuries.

That didn’t stop the industry groups pushing the bill from suggesting that the legislation was needed to stem the risk of violent protest. In December 2017 five energy trade groups and a big oil company sent a letter to lawmakers listing six examples of threats environmentalists posed to their infrastructure.

Only one example actually involved environmentalists. During the Dakota Access fight activists clipped the locks on fenced-in portions of a connected oil pipeline in the Midwest and closed the valves briefly cutting off the flow of oil to refineries. The demonstrators were arrested and prosecuted under existing laws. The other five examples had nothing to do with protesters and were instead loosely bound by mental illness or workplace grievances.

The fearmongering harkens back to the years immediately after the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks when the FBI declared ecoterrorism the biggest domestic threat and used the sweeping surveillance and law enforcement measures passed under the Patriot Act to harass environmental radicals. As a young journalist working for the Chicago Tribune in 2002 Will Potter fell into the federal government’s crosshairs when FBI agents threatened to make life “very difficult” for him if he didn’t agree to become an informant on the animal rights group he and his girlfriend had protested with months earlier. In 2018 Potter compared the ALEC bill to the post-Patriot Act crackdown.

“It’s about installing fear so they don’t go out and protest in the first place” Will Potter author of “Green Is The New Red” told HuffPost at the time. “The purpose of this law isn’t to wrap everybody up and send them to federal prison. It’s to scare people to create fear.”

The Latest Wave

The Minnesota bill faces dim prospects of becoming law in a state where Democrats control the governor’s mansion and half the legislature. Earlier versions of the bill introduced in 2018 2019 and 2020 all failed to reach the floor for a vote.

The legislation could however win approval in Arkansas Montana Kansas.

The Arkansas bill designates a range of fenced-off areas associated with natural gas and oil production and storage as “critical infrastructure.” Purposely entering or remaining on such infrastructure would be a Class D felony punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10000 fine according to the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law’s U.S. Protest Law Tracker.

The bill makes causing “damage” to critical infrastructure a Class B felony punishable by up 20 years in prison and a $15000 fine though the legislation does not define what constitutes damage. That means “protesters who hold a peaceful sit-in at a pipeline construction site and paint protest slogans on construction material for instance could face lengthy prison sentences” the ICNL stated on its website.

“One might hope that any reasonable prosecutor judge or jury would only use such a charge to go after people who compromise public safety in a very serious way” Connor Gibson an independent researcher who tracks anti-fossil fuel protest bills wrote in a newsletter about the Arkansas bill earlier this month. “But do you want to be the one to test that theory?”

The Montana bill introduced last month is more standard. The legislation labels virtually any coal natural gas or oil facility “critical infrastructure” and makes trespassing “without permission by the owner of the critical infrastructure on conviction” a misdemeanor “punishable by a fine of not more than $1500 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months.” Trespassing with the intent to vandalize would be “a felony punishable by a fine of not more than $4500 or by imprisonment for not more than 18 months or both.” Tampering with the facility or causing any damage would amount to “a felony punishable by a fine of not more than $150000 or by imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.”

Like the other bills the Montana legislation threatens that “any organization found to be a conspirator” with individuals convicted on any of those charges “shall be punished by a fine that is 10 times the amount of the fine provided for the appropriate crime.” The legislation defines an “organization” broadly as “a group of people structured in a specific way to achieve a series of shared goals.”

The bill is set for a hearing before the Montana Legislature’s Judiciary Committee next Wednesday.

The legislation in Kansas stands out for its creative expansion of existing racketeering laws ― the kind that’s put in place to help prosecute organized crime syndicates like the Mafia ― to cover those who “commit attempt to commit conspire to commit or to solicit coerce or intimidate another person to commit” acts such as trespassing on fossil fuel companies’ property.

Critics say the bill is mostly about politics a way for its author Republican state Sen. Mike Thompson to signal his climate-denying views now that he’s serving as chair of the Senate’s utilities committee.

“There is no anti-pipeline movement in Kansas in particular and there’s never been any kind of protest or civil disobedience at any kind of fossil fuel site” said Rabbi Moti Rieber executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Action a religious coalition that advocates for climate action in the state. “So this is a bill that addresses a problem that doesn’t exist.”

Thompson did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Monday.

At a hearing on Tuesday officials from two of the oil and gas industry’s top trade groups ― the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute ― testified in favor of the legislation. API’s Kansas representative J. Kent Eckles said “environmental attacks on our industry” made the measures necessary.

Reading between the lines Rieber said the legislation was meant to dissuade groups like his from taking part in future protests by raising the risk that a demonstration could hold a church temple or mosque liable for thousands of dollars in fines if one of its members is convicted under the statute if it passes.

“There are people of faith who are concerned about climate change as a religious imperative and you can imagine something where they’d do a public witness at a fossil fuel installation” Rieber said. “This is meant to intimidate people from taking action.”

It’s a sentiment that resonates with Goodwin. On the day she was cited she had spent hours praying beside the gushing river and connecting with the spirits who she believes have guided the Ojibwe for generations. She sees herself as “protecting my homeland my treaty and my religious freedom.” She’s afraid of what might happen if the legislation passes but she said she won’t be deterred."

""We need someone in the Texas legislature to file a bill requiring the oil and gas industry to thoroughly winterize all their equipment.""

--Sharon Wilson Earthworks

Winter storm Uri which killed dozens of people and cut off power to over four million Texans at its peak also disrupted supplies needed to keep the state's refineries and petrochemical plants operating. As they shut down refineries flared--or burned off--gases in order to prevent damage to their processing units.

According to the Texas Commission on Environment Quality the five largest refiners emitted nearly 337000 pounds of pollutants in this manner.

ExxonMobil's Baytown Olefins plant in Baytown released 68000 tons of carbon monoxide and nearly a ton of benzene in what it called a ""safe utilization of the flare system.""

Critics noted however that benzene is harmful to bone marrow red blood cells and the immune system.

""There is no safe amount of benzene for human exposure"" Sharon Wilson a researcher at the advocacy group Earthworks told Reuters.

Motiva's Port Arthur refinery released 118100 pounds of pollutants into the air between February 15 and February 18. This was triple the amount of excess emissions the plant reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the entire year of 2019.

Valero's refinery in Port Arthur flared 78000 pounds of pollutants over 24 hours beginning February 15 while Marathon Petroleum's Galveston Bay refinery released 14255 pounds in less than five hours that same day.

Hilton Kelly who lives in Port Arthur told Reuters that there were ""six or seven flares going at one time.""

Wilson said that the flaring ""could have been prevented"" by winterizing the refineries.

""We need someone in the Texas legislature to file a bill requiring the oil and gas industry to thoroughly winterize all their equipment"" Wilson toldEarther. ""The bill probably won't pass in Texas but that will create some more scrutiny about it.""

Earther reports that between February 11 and February 18 there were 174 so-called ""emissions events"" from fossil fuel facilities in Texas compared to between 37 and 46 such events in weeks before the storm.

In addition to the previously mentioned pollutants chemicals released from Texas facilities include over 6500 pounds of the carcinogen isoprene from a Shell plant in Deer Park near Houston as well as an indeterminate amount of methane which is 84 times more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over the short term.

Wilson told Earther that ""in Texas we don't count methane"" in pollution reports.

The release of large amounts of dangerous pollutants during Uri stands in stark contrast with claims by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that alternative energy sources such as solar and wind are responsible for Uri's deadly power outages and that the Green New Deal would be a ""deadly deal"" for the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3RleGFzLWZyZWV6ZS1sZWQtcmVsZWFzZS10b25zLWFpci1wb2xsdXRhbnRzLXJlZmluZXJpZXMtc2h1dC0yMDIxLTAyLTIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas freeze led to release of tons of air pollutants as refineries shut,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/texas-freeze-led-release-tons-air-pollutants-refineries-shut-2021-02-21/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3RleGFzLWZyZWV6ZS1sZWQtcmVsZWFzZS10b25zLWFpci1wb2xsdXRhbnRzLXJlZmluZXJpZXMtc2h1dC0yMDIxLTAyLTIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZwb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRyeS9mb3NzaWwtZnVlbC1wcm90ZXN0X25fNjAyYzFmZjZjNWI2Yzk1MDU2ZjNmNmFm0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVmZnBvc3QuY29tL2VudHJ5L2Zvc3NpbC1mdWVsLXByb3Rlc3Rfbl82MDJjMWZmNmM1YjZjOTUwNTZmM2Y2YWYvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 More States Propose Harsh New Penalties For Protesting Fossil Fuels,"Dawn Goodwin spent her 50th birthday among towering pines and yellow birches whose tree rings make her lifespan seem like a child’s in comparison. But on that cool overcast Saturday in December the growling of construction trucks and chainsaws drowned out the natural soundscape of gushing freshwater and wind whispering between pine needles on the banks of the Mississippi River.

Goodwin was at this river crossing near Palisade Minnesota to protest the construction of the energy company Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline a $9.3 billion project to carry tar-sands oil ― one of the dirtiest varieties of crude oil ― from Joliette North Dakota to a terminal facility in Clearbrook Minnesota. From there it’s distributed to refineries. Goodwin winced as workers felled a mighty spruce while clearing a 50-foot berth for the pipeline its sappy rings laid bare as its crown thudded to the ground.

“At that moment the tree just spoke to me saying ‘I’m being disrespected. I am medicine. And they’re just cutting me and throwing me aside with no care’” said Goodwin who lives on the White Earth Reservation and goes by the Ojibwe name Gaagigeyaashiik. “I just felt like I needed to go and pick it up so I walked over.”

Without realizing it she’d stepped over an invisible border and had officially trespassed into a construction site. Within seconds half a dozen police officers surrounded her carrying zip ties to arrest her. Video footage of the incident shows her ― bundled in an oversize green hoodie a black winter jacket and matching mittens ― apologizing repeatedly as fellow activists chant “Let her go.” It proved enough to talk the officers down to a misdemeanor citation. She’s due in court next week.

Under a new bill in the Minnesota legislature Goodwin could face much steeper consequences. Had any of her fellow activists caused even minor damage to equipment at the site the bill could’ve held virtually anyone even remotely involved — especially those caught trespassing — liable for the damage threatening protesters with up to 10 years in prison and $20000 in fines.

An activist wouldn’t even need to be convicted of trespassing to be held liable ― an arrest is enough under the legislation.

“It is extremely draconian” said Teresa Nelson the legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota. “We don’t impose those kinds of punishments on people in any other part of our statutory code.”

Minnesota’s bill is tougher than similar legislation proposed in other states but it’s not unique. The legislation follows a model that’s been approved in 14 states and is also under consideration in Arkansas Montana and Kansas. The model designates ― if it isn’t already so ― any oil gas coal or plastics facilities as “critical infrastructure” and adds aggressive new penalties for vague charges of trespassing or tampering.

This special status is normally given to dams and nuclear reactors and allows lawmakers to increase criminal penalties for commonplace protest at these sites such as blocking a roadway tethering oneself to equipment or even just rallying near a company’s property. In many cases any person or organization associated with an individual activist convicted of breaking the law can be held accountable. What was once a misdemeanor is now reclassified as more severe crimes ― in some cases even felonies ― with fines of tens of thousands of dollars and convictions can sometimes carry jail sentences.

The uptick in these proposals is a sign that state lawmakers are using the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot to justify new restrictions on peaceful demonstrations that are meant to prevent protests in the first place free-speech experts say.

“When someone has to weigh the potential of imprisonment for protesting they will really very likely limit their own speech” said Nora Benavidez director of the advocacy group PEN America’s U.S. free expressions program. “These bills are just a chilling effect on protest.”

Imprisoning Slaves’ Descendants Bankrupting Tiny Churches

The similarities among the state bills are no accident.

The legislation is based on a model bill that the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) a right-wing policy shop funded by corporations and conservative billionaires drafted and began promoting to Republican state lawmakers in the wake of the fight over the Dakota Access pipeline project. State disclosure records routinely show lobbyists for companies such as Enbridge Exxon Mobil Corp. Koch Industries and Marathon Petroleum consulting lawmakers on the legislation.

Bills of this type have surfaced in roughly half of states over the past four years but they’ve passed at a more rapid pace since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the country fell into crisis the governors in Kentucky South Dakota and West Virginia all signed legislation in the middle of March 2020.

Some bills have proven too harsh even in states where the fossil fuel industry is most powerful. Louisiana’s Republican-controlled legislature for example passed a bill last May that would have imposed mandatory three-year prison sentences for trespassing on fossil fuel sites. It potentially created a scenario where the state would’ve needed to jail elderly Black women seeking recognition of a slave burial ground that possibly contained their ancestors’ remains. The state’s Democratic governor John Bel Edwards vetoed the bill.

Yet brutal outcomes for typically sympathetic figures have done little to dissuade other governors. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed a bill last month that religious leaders warned could bankrupt “some tiny little church in the middle of Appalachia that’s trying to protect its people from pollution” the Rev. Joan VanBecelaere executive director of Unitarian Universalist Justice Ohio told HuffPost in December.

The Green Bogeyman

That bills are predicated on the idea that fossil fuel protesters are becoming more violent is somewhat ironic. The model for the legislation came in response to the Dakota Access pipeline conflict in which militarized police and private security forces brutalized environmentalists and Indigenous activists who for months camped out at the site of the proposed oil project. At least 300 unarmed protesters were injured in a single day and one woman nearly lost her arm following a crackdown by police. The heavily armed security forces reported no similar injuries.

That didn’t stop the industry groups pushing the bill from suggesting that the legislation was needed to stem the risk of violent protest. In December 2017 five energy trade groups and a big oil company sent a letter to lawmakers listing six examples of threats environmentalists posed to their infrastructure.

Only one example actually involved environmentalists. During the Dakota Access fight activists clipped the locks on fenced-in portions of a connected oil pipeline in the Midwest and closed the valves briefly cutting off the flow of oil to refineries. The demonstrators were arrested and prosecuted under existing laws. The other five examples had nothing to do with protesters and were instead loosely bound by mental illness or workplace grievances.

The fearmongering harkens back to the years immediately after the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks when the FBI declared ecoterrorism the biggest domestic threat and used the sweeping surveillance and law enforcement measures passed under the Patriot Act to harass environmental radicals. As a young journalist working for the Chicago Tribune in 2002 Will Potter fell into the federal government’s crosshairs when FBI agents threatened to make life “very difficult” for him if he didn’t agree to become an informant on the animal rights group he and his girlfriend had protested with months earlier. In 2018 Potter compared the ALEC bill to the post-Patriot Act crackdown.

“It’s about installing fear so they don’t go out and protest in the first place” Will Potter author of “Green Is The New Red” told HuffPost at the time. “The purpose of this law isn’t to wrap everybody up and send them to federal prison. It’s to scare people to create fear.”

As potentially dangerous variants of Covid-19 emerge globally — including one mutant that infiltrated a Kaiser Permanente emergency room in San Jose late last year — an East Bay biotech outlined plans Tuesday for an experimental next-generation coronavirus vaccine meant to tackle novel forms of the virus.

Gritstone Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: GRTS) of Emeryville said it will work with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on a two-stage Phase I clinical trial of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that will begin later this quarter. That vaccine would not only knock down the “spike” protein that allows the virus to enter cells but also stimulate a part of the immune system to provide a second layer of defense.

It is an attractive price said Stephen Weisz CEO of Marriott Vacations Worldwide in a shareholder call.

Welk Resorts is one of the largest independent timeshare companies in North America.

Four Generations of Work

“We couldn’t be more excited for our Welk Resorts owners and team members to have MVW take us to this next chapter” said Jon Fredricks president and CEO of Welk Resorts and the bandleader’s grandson. “They share the same values of excellence which makes this the perfect pairing to build on the foundation laid by the Welk team and generations of the Welk family.”

Four generations of Welks have worked at the resort he said.

The Welk family selected its best offer after BofA Securities solicited buyers for the business. The process began in August said Fredricks. BofA approached private equity firms strategic buyers in the hospitality industry and other investors.

As with many families family members had a certain amount of net worth in the company yet no cash or access to cash. There was a desire for a liquidity event Fredricks said.

Early in the pandemic the debt and capital markets were doing poorly. When the markets came back the family decided it was a good time to sell he said.

Employee Ownership

Some 12% of the company is held in an employee stock ownership plan or ESOP. That will end with a “great liquidity event for team members” Fredricks also said.

Selling the family owned resorts after 57 years is “bittersweet” he said.

Welk Resorts owns eight upscale resort locations in San Diego County; Palm Springs; Lake Tahoe; Cabo San Lucas Mexico; Breckenridge Colorado; and Branson Missouri. In late 2019 and early 2020 Welk announced management contracts with several resorts including El Corazon de Santa Fe by Welk Resorts in Santa Fe New Mexico as well as the Eagle Point Vacation Community in Vail Colorado.

With Welk Resorts the buyer will acquire 1400 units (roughly half of them in San Diego County) and 55000 members. Hyatt Residence Club will increase its number of units by 90% and grow its membership from 33000 to 88000. There is little overlap among the properties.

Goals for 2023

The process of rebranding Welk Resorts will take up to nine months and total integration of the Welk and Hyatt Residence Club properties is expected by 2023 said Weisz.

By 2023 Marriott Vacations’ goal is to increase Welk’s 2019 sales by 20% to 30%. Revenue during 2019 was $215 million.

At least one local hotelier says rebranding may be a good idea.

“When I play golf there everyone is 55 plus” San Diego hotel owner Bob Rauch said of the Escondido property. “It’s not getting a lot of kids.” He added that the people staying at the property don’t seem to be families.

The Welk name probably dates the property since it is synonymous with an older generation Rauch said. Lawrence Welk’s television show ran from 1951 to 1982. Welk bought the Escondido property — then a motel and a nine-hole golf course — in 1964.

Marriott would do well to get a wider age range into the property to increase revenue substantially he said.

New Channels

As a small private company Welk Resorts has “nowhere near the buying power or expertise” of Marriott when marketing the property Rauch added.

“The acquisition will expand Hyatt Residence Club’s geographic presence while providing substantial future growth opportunities” said Weisz. “By leveraging our high-value marketing and sales channels and leveraging more efficient rental distribution channels we expect to be able to drive higher contract sales and expand margins.”

Weisz explained how the company would increase sales during an investor call.

“They [Welk Resorts] do a lot of tour generation through sports marketing and other kinds of tour generation only because quite frankly as a private company without a branded hospitality name behind it they didn’t have access to the same kind of tour generation channels that we enjoy both on the Marriott Westin and Sheraton side and on the Hyatt side” the CEO said. “So as a result I think they end up with a lot more tours which may or may not fit their profile.” That affects closing rates and translates to lower volume per guest or average dollar amount generated per prospective client.

The plan he continued is to leave low yield/high cost tour channels and go to higher yield/low cost channels.

Room to Grow

Welk Resorts has more than three years of built inventory — that is three years of runway at expected sales volumes before it has to build more facilities. Its properties have co-located land available for future expansion.

Welk Resorts has plenty of good things to offer its new owner Fredricks said including good managers and employees a strong digital marketing team and a strong customer relationship management system. The purchase will augment the relatively small number of Hyatt Residence Club resorts and relatively small staff. Timeshare sales for Hyatt Residence Club were $50 million in 2019 while Welk Resorts saw $130 million in sales the same year.

“Our team is not going to be disbanded. They’re going to be relied on to grow this incredible brand” Fredricks said.

Marriott Vacations Worldwide plans to pay for the transaction with $234 million in cash and approximately 1.4 million shares of its stock. Shares of VAC closed Feb.17 at $148.06.

Taking part of the purchase price in stock brings tax advantages Fredricks said.

On Jan. 28 Marriott Vacations Worldwide announced it had priced $500 million of convertible senior notes due 2026 to finance the acquisition including pay Welk debt.

Hogan Lovells is acting as legal adviser to Welk. J.P. Morgan is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Marriott Vacations Worldwide. BakerHostetler is acting as legal adviser to MVW.

This follows the company’s launch of the world’s first Central Bank digital currency-linked card which was created through an innovative partnership between Island Pay and MasterCard. According to the company this “groundbreaking solution” will increase the financial flexibility of thousands of customers here in The Bahamas and when traveling abroad “truly making Island Pay one of the most convenient ways for everyone to make payments”.

Island Pay Managing Director Jeffrey Beckles noted: “We are committed to revolutionizing fintech in The Bahamas. Making financial transactions easier and making funds more accessible to more people is at the core of our business model.

“Our game-changing partnership with MasterCard is the first in a range of new financial management solutions that we are bringing to the market to meet this pledge.”

Through this joint effort customers can purchase a co-branded MasterCard prepaid debit card with a balance of up to $500 at any Island Pay kiosk. The prepaid card works like any other debit card and can be used wherever the MasterCard logo is displayed. In Nassau Island Pay kiosks are stationed at the Thomas A Robinson National Stadium Crew Pub (East Street North) and Superwash laundromats on Carmichael Road West and Charles Saunders Highway. New kiosks will be installed at select ESSO service stations and Quality Home Centre in Nassau and in key locations on Grand Bahama over the next few weeks.

Shannon Hanna deputy general manager at Island Pay explained how this technology gives Bahamians residents and visitors more financial flexibility than ever before.

“What is especially significant about this technology is that it offers numerous benefits to many different types of customers” she said.

“For starters we are giving customers the flexibility and utility of a debit card without having to establish an account at a financial institution. This offers unbanked or underbanked consumers access to essential payment services.

“From a security perspective the prepaid cards are much safer than cash because they offer customers a level of privacy and protection by helping them remain anonymous and protect their identity. Another very timely benefit is that these cards offer customers access to a contactless shopping experience which is especially critical today considering the pervasiveness of the COVID-19 virus.”

Hanna confirmed that the prepaid debit cards can be used at any retailer or with any merchant who accepts MasterCard which she said makes them ideal for travelers.

“For example as a Bahamian or resident you can purchase a prepaid debit card at one of our kiosks and use it when you travel so you don’t have to worry about the dangers of carrying cash” she said.

“On the other hand if someone is visiting The Bahamas he or she can do the same thing — purchase a prepaid debit card at any of our kiosks and have access to US dollars without worrying about losing their money or holding lots of cash.

“Customers and merchants can expect to hear much more about our MasterCard prepaid debit cards merchant services and other fintech solutions designed to make life easier for everyone. Customers need to be able to manage their money in smarter faster and more personalized ways in the modern world. Island Pay is leading that charge.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzYWFzZXJhZGlvLmNvbS9tdG4tYW5kLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtZW1wb3dlci1taWxsaW9ucy1pbi1hZnJpY2EtdG8tbWFrZS1wYXltZW50cy1nbG9iYWxseS_SAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc2Fhc2VyYWRpby5jb20vbXRuLWFuZC1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWVtcG93ZXItbWlsbGlvbnMtaW4tYWZyaWNhLXRvLW1ha2UtcGF5bWVudHMtZ2xvYmFsbHkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MTN and Mastercard empower millions in Africa to make payments globally,"The MTN Group and Mastercard has announced a strategic partnership to enable millions of consumers in 16 countries across Africa to make global e-commerce payments safely and securely.

“Through a Mastercard virtual payment solution linked to MTN MoMo (Mobile Money) wallets consumers and merchants can engage with brands and businesses abroad through digital commerce extending their reach to an international marketplace and unlocking a host of opportunities” it said.

A joint statement issued by the MTN Group and Mastercard said across Sub-Saharan Africa mobile devices were the primary channel used to connect to the internet and that according to GSMA by 2025 it was estimated that there would be 300 million more people using their devices to access internet services.

“In light of this significant growth mobile financial services have become the dominant form of digital payments with twice as many mobile money accounts as bank accounts in the region. As a result consumers increasingly expect to have access to a broader range of digital financial services” it stated.

The statement said however consumers and merchants were mostly restricted to a local base of online and offline businesses therefore curtailing customers’ ability to engage in global commerce.

It said through this strategic partnership MTN customers with a Mastercard virtual payment solution linked to their MoMo wallets can make payments to global online merchants through a seamless and secure digital payment experience on websites and mobile applications.

The service was available regardless of whether or not the customer has a bank account.

The statement said the solution would enable consumers to explore and shop at well-known global e-commerce brands and pay quickly and securely for leisure shopping travel accommodation entertainment streaming services and more.

It would also allow small business owners to purchase from suppliers abroad and pay with the virtual payment solution.

“We are very excited about this partnership with Mastercard which is another step in realizing our ambition to build Africa’s largest fintech platform accelerating economic and social development through digital innovation to the benefit of citizens across the continent and beyond” the MTN Group said.

It added that “This noteworthy partnership is another step to enable our customers to participate in the global economy. We are resolute that accelerated financial inclusion is a potent enabler of socio-economic development that empowers the most vulnerable in society.”

The Mastercard said: “This significant milestone will enable millions of MTN customers to benefit from global digital commerce and drive digital and financial inclusion across Africa through easy and secure access to financial services.

“At Mastercard our innovation strategy is based on partnerships and collaboration. This agreement with MTN shows that we can deliver innovative digital solutions that have a far-reaching impact and realize the true potential of inclusive growth across the continent.

“Partnering with MTN allows us to accelerate our global pledge to connect one billion people to the digital economy by 2025 bringing us closer to a world beyond cash” it said.

The MTN and Mastercard first launched the digital payment solution in 2018 for MoMo customers. MTN the largest mobile network operator is the ‘Most Admired African Brand’ based on spontaneous consumer responses in Brand Africa 100: Africa’s Best Brands 2020 survey and the most valuable telecoms brand in Africa by Brand Finance Africa.

The company will extend the virtual payment solution offering throughout its Fintech footprint.

The expansion of this payment solution will play a significant role in driving the growth of digital inclusion and e-commerce thus increasing MTN MoMo customer inclusion into the global economy.

Initially designed to facilitate the transfer of cash between mobile users MTN’s MoMo offering is now much broader – including loans insurance remittances and payments.

Brex has just made an announcement that should allow it to offer even more services to businesses. This has the potential to be some exciting new competition in the business credit card space especially with Brex having its own points currency.

Brex will have a wholly-owned subsidiary bank

Business financial services company Brex has submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank which would be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brex. Brex Bank would be an industrial bank located in Draper Utah.

Up until now Brex has been focused on taking a new approach towards business financial services by combining payment products with financial software. With this Brex has become the operating system for thousands of businesses. Up until now Brex hasn’t had its own bank but rather has used Emigrant Bank as the issuer for its Brex Card.

With this announcement Brex has hired Bruce Wallace as the proposed CEO of Brex Bank. He previously worked at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) as the Chief Operations Officer Chief Digital Officer and Head of Global Services.

Brex Card is currently issued by Emigrant Bank

What will change with Brex having its own bank?

With Brex Bank being formed Brex plans to expand its existing suite of financial products and business software offering credit solutions and FDIC insured deposit products to small and medium-sized businesses (and just to be clear deposits with Brex’s partner banks are already FDIC insured).

The current Brex Card that’s issued with Brex Cash accounts is essentially a hybrid between a debit card and a credit card — it’s a World Elite Mastercard that earns rewards like a credit card while your spending is automatically debited from your Brex account like a debit card.

With Brex Bank being formed presumably Brex could start issuing actual credit cards with credit limits financing etc.

Brex has been innovative in terms of its offerings and I’m just excited to see another competitor enter the market with the potential to expand significantly over time. Brex is extremely well funded having amassed nearly $500 million in venture capital funding to date. Maybe we’ll see the company go up against the likes of Amex and Chase with its product offerings.

What I appreciate about Brex is that unlike other fintech companies Brex also has a focus on rewards and even has a transferable points currency.

Brex has a transferable points currency and we could see that expand further

Open a Brex Cash account and earn 110K points

One of Brex’s newest products is Brex Cash which is a no-fee business cash management account. Opening a Brex Cash account is an incredible opportunity given that you can earn up to 110000 points (exclusively for OMAAT readers) there’s no credit pull and again the account has no fees. Points can be redeemed for one cent each or can be transferred to several airline partners at a 1:1 ratio so that’s potentially exceptionally valuable.

Bottom line

Brex plans on forming Brex Bank which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary that will allow the fintech company to expand its product offering. It’s always great to see some innovation in the banking and credit card space and I can’t wait to see what Brex comes up with over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYml0YnV5LmNhL25ld3MvdGhlLWJpdGJ1eS1icmllZi13aG9zLWNoYW5naW5nLXRoZWlyLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZvci1iaXRjb2lu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bitbuy Brief: BTC Changing Business!,"Issue 131: BTC Changing Business!

Thursday February 18th 2021

Weekly Market Update: BTC Smashing $50K USD!

Analysis: Bitcoin finally passed the $50000 USD and is currently above $66000 CAD for the first time this week. Bitcoin Cash had the biggest gain of all coins supported on Bitbuy this week with over a 25% gain.

Big Story: Many Are Buying But Who’s Changing Their Business For BTC?

BTC Has Made New All-Time Highs With Prominent Investors As Paul Tudor Jones Endorsing The Asset As An Investment. At The Same Time A Number Of Prominent Institutions Have Integrated Bitcoin Into Their Actual Business. We Provide An Overview Of Those That Have Recently Announced Business Lines Incorporating BTC/Crypto

PayPal: PayPal announced in October 2020 that it will allow users to buy sell and hold BTC along with Ethereum Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. PayPal has placed its crypto ambitions within a broader vision of an increasingly digitized financial system. Therefore the firm also indicated that it intends to ‘increase cryptocurrency’s utility by making it available as a funding source for purchases at [PayPal’s] 26 million merchants worldwide.’

Mastercard: Last week payment processor Mastercard announced it will begin supporting unspecified cryptocurrencies on its network later in the year. The firm wrote that it wants to ‘enable customers merchants and businesses to move digital value – traditional or crypto – however they want.’ Mastercard has previously partnered with crypto payments firms Wirex and BitPay and exchange LVL ‘to create crypto cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies.’

Visa: At the beginning of the month Visa announced a partnership with ‘digitally native neobank’ First Boulevard to pilot Visa’s new crypto APIs. These APIs are described as allowing First Boulevard to ‘enable their customers to purchase custody and trade digital assets held by Anchorage a federally chartered digital asset bank.’ In a Q1 2021 earnings call CEO Al Kelly said the firm is ‘uniquely positioned to help make cryptocurrencies more safe useful and applicable for payments…’ and broadly described plans to allow users to ‘cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase…’

In other Business news

City of Miami: Last week Miami’s Commissioners passed a resolution that will see the city study the feasibility of paying city employees in BTC and allowing residents to pay fees and taxes in the coin. The resolution requests the State Government to support the city’s plan to invest in BTC according to Mayor Francis Suarez.

BNY Mellon: The US’ oldest bank announced plans to custody transfer and sell BTC and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of its clients last week. The bank plans to allow cryptocurrencies to eventually pass through the same infrastructure currently being used by its asset-management clients.

Tesla: Tesla made USD 1.5B equivalent of BTC to its balance sheet. The automaker will also start accepting the coin as payments for its products.

If you remember earlier this week we went over Mutapa’s website. The platform offers a place for local businesses to display and sell goods and services.

On top of offering a storefront Mutapa also assists businesses on its site with logistics. Moving goods to and fro is normally a headache for small businesses and it was nice to see that Mutapa has a facility in place.

Mutapa and CBZ

The partnership between CBZ and Mutapa will allow businesses on the e-commerce platform to receive VISA and Mastercard payments online. Vendors on the site can now receive payments from customers who have VISA and Mastercard US$ prepaid cards locally and those abroad.

CBZ and Mutapa’s partnership I think demonstrates the former’s realisation that e-commerce is where it’s at. For the latter it shows that they aren’t wasting any time in getting the widest spectrum of services for businesses on their site as well those who will shop on it.

e-commerce is the future

We all thought that 2021 was going to be a different year. But the pandemic is still here and business is still depressed and restricted. With the largely informal nature of Zimbabwe’s economy a platform like Mutapa is one of many important dominos that will move sales online.

It’s also good to see CBZ get in on the e-commerce scene and supporting a local site. Hopefully this means that more banks will see the viability of not just partnering with e-commerce services but with Zimbabwean startups across a number of industries."

The packages used in the current analysis are: pandas for data cleaning; glob for data merging; numpy for data filtering and group; plotly.express for data visulisation

import pandas as pd

import glob

import numpy as np

import plotly.express as px

Step 1 Get data import data and merge data

The data used in the current analysis was from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/massibelloni/serie-a-19932017). I downloaded all Serie A data from 1993 to 2017 and saved to local folders.

path = r'....(your local folder)\SerieA'

all_files = glob.glob(path + ""/*.csv"") table = [] for filename in all_files:

data = pd.read_csv(filename index_col=None header=0)

table.append(df) frame = pd.concat(table axis=0 ignore_index=True)

As the analysis only used the data from first seven columns those columns were selected:

df = frame.iloc[:0:7]

Now the dataframe looks like this:

Figure 1: df.head(10)

Step 2 Add columns according to visualisation needs

For a better visualisation a few columns have been added based on the current data frame:

### To identify the winner of each match: if ""H""- the home team was the winner if ""A"" the away team was the winner else draw: df['Winner'] = np.where(df['FTR'] == 'H'df['HomeTeam']

np.where(df['FTR'] == 'A' df['AwayTeam'] ""Draw"")) ### To identify the result of each match: whether the home team won the away team won or drew: df['Result'] = np.where(df['FTR'] == 'H''HomeTeamWin'

np.where(df['FTR'] == 'A' 'AwayTeamWin' ""Draw"")) ### To identify how many goals did the winner had:

df['Result'] = np.where(df['FTR'] == 'H''HomeTeamWin'

np.where(df['FTR'] == 'A' 'AwayTeamWin' ""Draw"")) ### To get the ""Year"" of each match:

df['Year']=pd.DatetimeIndex(df['Date']).year ### To get the total number of goals in each match and the goal differences:

df['TotalGoal'] = df['FTHG'] + df['FTAG']

df['GoalDif']= df['FTHG']- df['FTAG']

The dataframe with more columns looks like this:

Figure 2: df.head(10)

Step 3 Visualisations

Pie Charts I

To start with the basic information I would like to know is in Serie A what are the proportions of wining a match vs drew; and who got more chances to win the match — the home team or the away team:

To get this visualisation I grouped the “Results” first before applying plotly.express:

### Group the data by Result:

general = df.groupby('Result')['Result'].count().reset_index(name = ""count"") ### Apply px.pie:

fig1 = px.pie(general values ='count' names ='Result' title='Serie A - results from 1993 - 2017' color = 'Result'

color_discrete_map={'HomeTeamWin':'royalblue'

'AwayTeamWin':'orangered'

'Draw':'lightgreen'}) ### Add text and define text information:

fig1.update_traces(textposition='inside' textinfo='percent+value')

fig1.show()

Figure 3: Pie Chart I — Proportion of win/draw

This chart clearly demonstrates that nearly 70% of the matched had a winner and home team was more+ likely to win compared to the away home — I would consider this is what is called — Home team advantage!

Pie Chart II

Another thing I was really interested in was which team won the most matches and how the rank looked like:

### Group by Winner

teamresult = df.groupby('Winner')['Winner'].count().reset_index(name = ""Count"") ### Drop the results which were ""Draw"" as this data was not required for the visualisation

teamresult = teamresult[teamresult.Winner != 'Draw'] ### Visualisation

fig2 = px.pie(teamresult values = 'Count' names = 'Winner' title = ""Serie A Result from 1993 - 2017 - Most Win Team"" color = 'Winner' color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Light24)

fig2.update_traces(textposition='inside' textinfo='percent+label')

fig2.show()

Figure 4: Pie Chart I I— Proportion of most win team

It is interesting to see that Juventus won more matches than other teams which is followed by Inter and Milan.

Sunburst Chart

One type of fancy charts that I used very often in PowerBI visualisation is sunburst chart. In this visualisation I would like to know from year 2012 to 2016 which team won more matches each year.

### To remove ""draw"" results and filter the year between 2012-16

sun = df[(df.Winner != 'Draw') & (df.Year.between(20122016))] ### Group results by Year & Winner

sun1 = sun.groupby(['Year''Winner'])['Winner'].count().reset_index(name = ""Count"") ### Sunburst chart visualisation

fig3 = px.sunburst(sun1 path=[ 'Year''Winner'] values='Count')

fig3.update_traces(textinfo = 'label + value')

fig3.show()

Figure 5: Sunburst chart — Winner by year by team

Treemap Chart

Another way of visualise proportion which I found very handy and easy to interpret is Treemap chart. Here’s an example of visualise the numbers of total wins by team using treemap chart:

### Remove the results which were ""draw""

treemap = df[(df.Winner != 'Draw')] ### Group data by Team

treemap1 = treemap.groupby('Winner')['Winner'].count().reset_index(name = ""Count"") ### Visualise the data with treemap

fig4 = px.treemap(treemap1 path=['Winner'] values='Count'

)

fig4.update_traces(textinfo = 'label + value')

Figure 6: Treemap — Most win team

As you can see treemap is a very good chart to display the proportion and the comparisons between different items. Especially if you are comparing many items pie chart may be limited by the spaces for text/annotations treemap provides a better way presenting those information.

Line Chart

To further explore the data I was thinking to create a line chart showing the grand total goals each year:

### Group total goals by year

total_goal =df.groupby('Year')['TotalGoal'].agg('sum').reset_index(name = 'Sum') ### Remove the data for 1993 and 2017 as it seemed that the data for those years were not complate

total_goal = total_goal[(total_goal.Year != 2017) & (total_goal.Year != 1993)] ### Visualise by line chart

fig5 = px.line(total_goal x = 'Year' y = 'Sum' title = 'Total Goals by Year'

line_shape = 'spline')

fig5.show()

Figure 7: Line chart — Total Goals

Bar Chart

One more thing I would like to know is how teams perform differently as home / away teams. Did they score more goals when they were home team?

### Number of goals for hometeam

test1 = df.groupby('HomeTeam')['FTHG'].agg('sum').reset_index(name = 'HomeSum')

test1 = test1.rename(columns={""HomeTeam"": ""Team1""}) ### Number of goals for awayteam

test2 = df.groupby('AwayTeam')['FTAG'].agg('sum').reset_index(name = 'AwaySum')

test2 = test2.rename(columns = {'AwayTeam':'Team2'}) ### Merge two dataframe

result = pd.concat([test1 test2] axis=1)

dt = result.drop(['Team2'] axis=1) ### Visualise the chart

fig6 = px.bar(dt x = ""Team1"" y =['HomeSum''AwaySum'] title = 'Goals by Home & Away')

fig6.show()

Figure 8: Bar chart — goals at home/away

It seems that teams are more likely to score goals when they were playing at home.

How about the total goals for each team?

### Total goals by each team

dt['Total'] = dt['HomeSum']+dt['AwaySum'] ### Rename column

dt= dt.rename(columns={'Team1':'Team'}) ### Bar chart visualisation

fig6 = px.bar(dt x='Team' y='Total' text = 'Total' color = 'Total'

color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Viridis)

It is amazing that Roma had more than 1500 goals in those years although the team won the Scudetto (annual championship) once.

It seems that youngster Prithvi Shaw has finally managed to rediscover his rhythm with the bat as he scored a match-winning century for Mumbai during their Vijay Hazare Trophy clash against Delhi during their Round 1 Elite Group D match at Jaipuria Vidyalaya Ground Jaipur on Sunday.

Shaw makes his bat talk

Restricting Delhi to a modest total of 211/7 after winning the toss and electing to bowl Shaw meant business as he took on the Delhi bowlers once he was set in the middle despite losing his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal early. He then added 82 runs along with skipper Shreyas Iyer (39) for the second-wicket stand before the latter was dismissed and out came Suryakumar Yadav at number four.

SKY played a supporting role to perfection with an unbeaten 33-ball 50. However all eyes were on Prithvi Shaw as he successfully anchored the Mumbai run chase with an outstanding century. The young batsman remained unbeaten on an 89-ball 105 at a strike rate of close to 118 including 14 boundaries and a couple of maximums as Mumbai crossed the finish line by seven wickets and 109 balls to spare.

Meanwhile the netizens also came forward to laud the youngster and one of them even opined that the opening batsman needs to be in Team India's scheme of things in white-ball cricket. Here are some of the reactions.

Well played👏👏👏 @PrithviShaw — Kanagaraj184 (@kanagaraj184)

Team India should keep him in Limited overs scheme of things !! — Danny (@Ddnyana)

Form is temporary Class is Permanent. First of many for Prithvi Shaw in this tournament. So happy to see him scoring runs. Pure dominance Mumbai. Well done ❤️ — Vishal Yadav (@VishalY44691113)

India's 2018 U-19 World Cup-winning skipper was last seen in action at the highest level during Team India's pink-ball Test match against Australia in December 2020. Shaw had a forgettable outing in that contest where he had failed to trouble the scorers in the first innings and could only manage a run-a-ball four in the second. He was dismissed in a similar fashion in both the innings by new-ball bowlers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins respectively.

The Mumbai cricketer was not only criticised for his poor form with the bat but was also benched for the remainder of the series as Shubman Gill made most of his chances as an opener as he finished with 259 runs in three matches.

After the Adelaide debacle a determined Indian team came back strongly in the remaining games to register a 2-1 series win and successfully retain the iconic Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Get ready for the second match of the sixth Pakistan Super League season with The Cricketer's match preview...

PSL 2021: Players to watch

PSL 2021: Things to watch

What’s the match?

Last season's runners-up Lahore Qalandars take on the 2017 winners in the second game of the 2021 Pakistan Super League.

When is it taking place?

The game is scheduled for 2pm PST (9am GMT) on Sunday February 21 2021.

Where is the match being played?

This game will take place in the national stadium in Karachi where all PSL 6 matches are being staged until March 7. At that point the tournament moves to Lahore.

This is due to Covid-19 protocols being implemented by tournament organisers.

Who’s got the form?

Though this is just the second match of the 2021 competition the teams squared off as recent as November in Eliminator 1 as the fifth edition came to an end last November.

On that occasion Qalandars prevailed by five wickets after chasing 171 to win with an over to spare on their way to the final where they were beaten by Karachi Kings

Who to watch?

Rashid Khan was one of the pick-ups of the draft yet will only be available for a handful of matches for Qalandars due to his involvement with Afghanistan in their Test series against Zimbabwe.

Therefore plenty of onus will be on the legspinner to leave everything out there before departing what is his maiden PSL campaign.

For at least four matches Qalandars will have a fearsome attack which includes Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf but they will have limited time to make a tangible impact.

It may well be that this contest becomes a battle of the Afghan spinners with Zalmi having recruited Mujeeb ur Rahman for what will also be his first campaign in the competition.

Mujeeb has not been called up for the Tests but is in line to feature in the T20s meaning he'll be involved for the entire group phase.

The 19-year-old trails international compatriot Rashid for experience but he sits 16th in the men's T20 Player Index just 13 places behind him and this month will represent a good opportunity to close the gap.

Any major team news?

The PSL's all-time leading wicket-taker Wahab Riaz is expected to miss Zalmi's opening game after reportedly breaching Covid protocols on Friday (February 19).

He and coach Daren Sammy are understood to have left the bio-secure bubble to meet with team owner Javed Afridi during a practice session

They must now self-isolate for three days and return two negative tests for Covid-19 before being permitted to return to action.

Are fans allowed in?

Yes PSL 6 matches are operating at 20 per cent capacity in 2021 with stringent Covid-19 precautionary measures in place. Fans will have to wear a mask in the stands and groups may only consist of members of one household for example.

Who are the umpires?

Shozab Raza and Rashid Riaz (on-field umpires)

Zameer Haider (third umpire)

Imran Jawed (fourth umpire)

Iftikhar Ahmed (match referee)

Full PSL umpire appointments - click here

Mujeeb has another chance to showcase his talent

What’s the prediction?

Qalandars are at full strength and won two of the pair's three meetings last term - including that key knockout game - and will feel confident of overcoming a beleaguered Zalmi.

What are the odds?

Qalandars are the marginal favourites with the bookies at 13/17 with Zalmi available at 6/5. The draw is an unlikely 18/1.

Where can I watch the game?

Sky Sports will broadcast the tournament in the UK.

In Pakistan the competition will be available on PTV Sports.

Sony Pictures Network have the rights in India.

Sony Pictures Network will also provide coverage throughout South Asia including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Sky Sport will televise the tournament in New Zealand while SuperSport hold the rights in South Africa and the sub-Saharan region.

Willow TV have all the action for viewers in the United States and Canada. In the Caribbean PSL 6 will be available on Flow Sports.

Streaming service Tapmad TV have the rights in Australia MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and the rest of the world with coverage available online and via the app.

What are the squads?

Lahore Qalandars: Ben Dunk David Wiese Dilbar Hussain Fakhar Zaman Haris Rauf Mohammad Hafeez Shaheen Shah Afridi Sohail Akhtar Rashid Khan Joe Denly Samit Patel Tom Abell Zeeshan Ashraf Salman Ali Agha Mohammad Faizan Maaz Khan Zaid Alam Ahmed Danyal

Two of the country’s biggest rivals Delhi and Mumbai will take face each other in the Elite Group D match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2020-21 on Sunday. Jaipuria Vidyalaya Ground will host the contest between the two sides. Till now Delhi has won the Vijay Hazare trophy only once which was way back in the 2012-13 season. In 2018 they came very close and lost in the finals. This time the responsibility of captaincy is on the shoulders of Pradeep Sangwan who is leading them for the 1st time in the major tournaments.

On the other hand 3-time champions Mumbai as named a full-strength squad for this year’s Vijay Hazare Trophy with Prithvi Shaw and Shreyas Iyer back in the side. Mumbai had beaten Delhi when they played last time in the 2018 finals by 4 wickets to clinch their 3rd title. They have won the last 4 out of 5 matches against Delhi and will look to continue their dominance this year as well. Both Mumbai and Delhi are pretty dangerous sides and they would want to start their tournament campaign with a win.

DEL vs MUM Top Picks for Today’s Dream11 Match:

India’s ODI opener Shikhar Dhawan had a decent tour of Australia where he scored 120 runs in 3 matches with a strike rate of 88.23. We know that if he gets a good start he is likely to convert them into big ones.

Nitish Rana was the leading run-scorer for Delhi last year scoring 311 runs in 8 matches at an average of 51.83 and a strike rate of 79.94 and he has taken 12 wickets with the ball at an economy of 4.08 runs per over.

Lalit Yadav will be a good pick for your Dream11 fantasy team. He is a good spin bowler and an even better batsman down the orderr who can increase the run-rate. Last year he scored 161 runs with the bat and took 4 wickets.

Yashaswi Jaiswal is one of the most talented upcoming cricketers in the country and was named man of the series in the U-19 world cup last year. He was the leading run-scorer for Mumbai last year Vijay Hazare trophy scoring whopping 564 runs in just 6 matches at an average of 112.80 and a strike rate of 104.05.

Prithvi Shaw will be hungry for runs after losing the test spot. He needs runs under his belt to prove that he can make a comeback to the Indian side. He always scores runs for Mumbai in the domestic cricket and that’s how he earned a call up for India.

Shreyas Iyer is another star attraction in this match. He is someone who likes to take the bowlers on from the start and scores at a brisk pace. He was the captain when Mumbai won their 3rd title.

Captain and Vice-Captain Selection:

Captain Options – Yashasvi Jaiswal Prithvi Shaw Shreyas Iyer

Vice-Captain Options – Nitish Rana Shikhar Dhawan Suryakumar Yadav

Eric Holcomb has locked in its two candidates according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

Sen. Mike Braun who chose not to run for reelection to the Senate and instead opted to run for governor is projected by the NBC News Decision Desk to beat a crowded field of Republican contenders including Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch.

Braun’s focus during the campaign was on improving economic opportunity within the state citing his experience as a small business owner. He also campaigned on protecting the rights of parents in making decisions related to education and on making healthcare more affordable through increased transparency according to his campaign website.

Democratic candidate Dr. Jennifer McCormick the state’s former superintendent of public instruction ran uncontested in the primary and was projected as the winner shortly after polls closed in northwest Indiana according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

McCormick received her doctorate in education from Indiana State University. She is running on a platform that includes increased investment in public education protection of reproductive rights and finding unique solutions to eliminate wasteful spending while not eliminating key programs according to her campaign website.

McCormick was endorsed prior to the election by the American Federation for Teachers’ Indiana chapter the Indiana State Teachers Association and several other groups.

Braun and McCormick will face off in the general election this fall. Holcomb was unable to seek reelection due to term limits imposed in the state but won his 2020 reelection campaign decisively.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdG52LmNvbS8xMy1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMvaXRzLWRlZmluaXRlbHktbm90LWNvZmZlZS1zcGl0dGluZy1tYWQtbWNkb25hbGRzLXdvcmtlci1jYXVzZXMtaGVhbHRoLXNjYXJlLWZvci12ZWdhcy1jdXN0b21lctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's definitely not coffee': Spitting-mad McDonald's worker causes health scare for Vegas customer,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — It's the kind of thing you hear about but don't think anyone would really do.

Vegas local Cynthia Baer says believe it.

""This actually happens to people! It happened to me"" she said.

A frustrated worker might actually spit in your food.

Here's Baer's story: she's a single mom selling her handmade masks on Etsy to help make ends meet. She says she needs to stay home and help her young children with online school.

""We live such a careful lifestyle. We stay home. We wear masks if we're out. We hand sanitize we wash our hands we do curbside pickups we do school at home"" she said.

On Dec. 22 Baer says she drove through her local McDonald's an independently-owned franchise on Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard to treat the kids to some fries and a strawberry shake.

""And I like to get a coffee - an iced sugar-free French vanilla latte to be exact"" Baer said.

But that day her usual drive-thru experience turned out to be anything but.

""She (drive-thru employee) cut me off halfway through my order and I said I'm not done ordering. I want to still order my drink. And she goes well it's too late to order"" Baer said.

Baer said she asked to speak with a supervisor: ""And he said he would take care of it and to pull forward and they would get my order. And then they said which I thought was curious your drink's not ready so you need to go to the third window.""

Curious but not yet concerned she says she drank the iced coffee only to get a nasty surprise when she was nearly finished.

""I felt that texture -- it's a slimy jelly-like texture in your mouth. And you know what that is and it's definitely not coffee. I could see there was a lot more in the bottom of the cup and it was a pretty large amount that was in my mouth"" Baer said.

Her coffee contained mucous and saliva according to Baer that she believed came from the McDonald's employee she had words within the drive-thru.

""To me it's like a threat to your life. It really is. We're all walking around wearing masks social distancing not going to school working from home and this person has the audacity to spit directly into something that you're going to drink! It is so dangerous!"" Baer said.

So she says she immediately called McDonald's to report that her drink had been tampered with.

""It seemed like either they didn't care or they didn't believe it. And she (the store manager) said if you can bring me the saliva then you can make a statement if you want to. She did ask for pictures also"" Baer said.

Baer says she gave McDonald's the photos they requested along with the rest of the spit that was in her drink.

""I'm sorry you had to deal with that on that end of things and I know from our side of the claim process getting information from McDonald's was not the speediest by any means"" said an insurance adjuster working for McDonald's in a phone call recorded by both sides.

The insurance adjuster told Baer about the surveillance video of the incident: ""The angle's not very clear but she acknowledged it so to me video or not she said she did that.""

""I felt violated!"" Baer said. ""I felt absolutely violated and I had concerns about what you could potentially get from ingesting someone's spit. Here you have a frontline restaurant worker who is choosing to be reckless knowing they are at very high risk for COVID.""

Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Asher Shahzad calls the employee's actions ""unacceptable and absolutely reckless.""

""If you check anybody's saliva you will probably find let's say close to 50 or maybe 100 or thousands of germs right at that moment"" Shahzad said.

And Baer says it got worse.

""I realized that I was having symptoms from COVID. I got very sick got tested and it was positive"" she said.

Baer tested positive for COVID on Dec. 27 five days after drinking the contaminated coffee.

There's no way of knowing if it came from the coffee but in her call with the insurance company she said she brought it up.

""I got COVID from it"" Baer said to the agent. ""Besides drinking someone's mucous.""

""And that's like the vast majority of it. Usually with someone who slips and breaks their arm it's usually really straightforward. With this I don't even know where to start to be completely honest"" the agent said to Baer. ""I'm willing to work with you.""

""The corporate office has offered me two free value meals and the insurance company offered me a $500 settlement"" Baer said.

Baer says she declined that initial offer.

And during the recorded conversation the agent made a second offer: ""I would say right off the bat I'll double it and put it up to $1000.""

Baer says she calls that a slap in the face like I didn't matter.

McDonald's told 13 Investigates that no one was available for an on-camera interview.

However local McDonald’s owner and operator F. Ronald Smith sent the following statement:

“Our number one priority is always the health and safety of our customers and employees. When we learned of the incident we took the appropriate steps necessary to investigate the matter and immediately contacted local health authorities. The employee in question is no longer with our organization. We have also reached out to officials at the Southern Nevada Health District and requested that the department revoke this individual’s Food Handler Card – we sincerely hope they comply with this request.

We pride ourselves on serving safe high quality food and beverages as well as adhering to all applicable local state and federal guidelines and regulations. We have apologized to the customer that we didn’t meet those standards in this unacceptable incident and are taking action to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.”

""McDonald's has got probably the best training system in the world. They train crew they train managers they train owners and operators on food safety as well as other things like managerial control etc. And to have something like this sneak through... There's no excuse for it"" said Tim Moulson.

And he should know. Moulson a certified food safety consultant worked for the McDonald's corporation for 25 years as director of training development and as operations consultant to franchisees.

He's also the past president of the Nevada Food Safety Task Force and currently sits on the Nevada Restaurant Association board.

""This really shocks me"" Moulson said. ""It shocks me and I'm sure it shocks McDonald's.""

He explains that restaurant employees aren't even allowed to eat or drink anywhere near the food preparation area.

""You can't help but have some spittle come out at the time when you're eating and that also can cause a communicable disease"" Moulson said.

Baer says the whole experience has put her on the defensive every time she goes out to eat.

""You don't know what they're doing back there. You don't know if they're tampering with your food or not"" Baer said.

And she says she hopes her story raises awareness and standards for all.

""Everyone is shocked by this"" said Darcy Spears. ""No one more than me"" Baer replied.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL0Zvb2QtQmV2ZXJhZ2UvTWNEb25hbGQtcy1KYXBhbi1zLWNlbGVicmF0ZWQtQ0VPLXBhc3Nlcy1iYXRvbi10by1kZXB1dHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Japan's celebrated CEO passes baton to deputy,"TOKYO -- McDonald's Holdings Japan will replace longtime chief Sarah Casanova credited with lifting struggling operations to a record profit with her hand-picked deputy next month entrusting him to achieve further growth as the pandemic alters consumer habits.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

Virtual Property NFT Game in the Blockchain Metaverse,"Upland.Me a virtual property metaverse that offers true ownership of NFT property parcels mapped to real addresses recently partnered with a company called Tilia Pay to pave the way for what the team is calling a truly digital economy.

Upland is a blockchain-based game in which users can buy sell and trade virtual properties mapped to the real world. By becoming a “digital landowner” users can build properties and earn UPX coins. The project utilizes blockchain to tie each property within the Upland platform to an NFT.

Perhaps unique from many new rising blockchain-based games Upland is seeking to create a market-based digital economy that blurs the lines between the real world and the digital world.

Users can purchase digital assets within the game with fiat or cryptocurrency (using the UPX coin) and trade the assets with other players. However it’s worth noting that for some time there was no way to cash out your UPX tokens– all you could do is reinvest it in other properties which earn you more UPX.

Its partner Tilia Pay specializes in helping video game publishers create in-world economies and monetize their interaction with other users. This partnership now enables users to essentially convert their holdings back into real-world value breaking the barrier between the real world and the digital world.

Upland.Me’s users can sell their virtual NFT property assets using Second Life’s payments network called Tilia Pay which supports PayPal as a main payment mechanism. So players could technically buy NFT representations of real estate in Upland’s virtual world and sell it for real U.S. dollars.

Known as the Property-to-USD beta program it has three top sales of around $1000 USD per piece. Since launch Upland’s players have spent $29250 USD on properties in the Upland metaverse with the average spend being $39.50 USD.

How Does Upland.Me Work?

Upland aims to provide a clean smooth user experience on the web iOS and Android in an effort to attract a wide audience. The Property-to-USD program is still in beta the ability to sell properties for USD is currently open to 100 Uplanders. However the team plans to increase that number gradually and the feature will eventually be available for all.

Here’s how it works for the beta testers:

Players can place their assets up for sale on the platform in USD.

The user goes through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process.

Once a property NFT is sold the Uplander can pull out their USD earnings directly to their private Paypal account.

The Upland community appears to be small but fairly interested in the gameplay. One player Wulfinite bought three properties for $500 UD each and his logic was as followed:

350 Mcallister St. (initial mint price of 193280 UPX or ~$193 USD) was bought because it is near City Hall.

3 Community Visitor Center (initial mint price of 135520 UPX or ~$135 USD) was bought because of the Rarity of Angel Island locations.

401 23rd St. (initial mint price of 356860 UPX or ~$356 USD) was bought for its area as Wulfinite intends to create a preschool there.



Final Thoughts

Upland.Me’s partnership with Tilia Pay enables Upland players to trade NFT-backed virtual properties based on real-world locations. With more than 10000 daily active users and over 40000 monthly active users Upland is making progress into an array of quickly growing blockchain-based games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY3J5cHRvbm9taXN0LmNoLzIwMjEvMDIvMjEvZnhiZmktYXdhcmQtd2lubmluZy1icm9rZXItdHJhZGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FXBFI the award-winning broker for trading,"SPONSORED POST

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

The Las Vegas Strip is largely empty after Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered a mandatory shutdown of most nonessential businesses in the state due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. Photo taken on Friday March 20 2020 in Las Vegas. (Benjamin Hager/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @benjaminhphoto

As Nevada approaches the anniversary of the start of the 78-day coronavirus-induced casino shutdown several sources are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.

The only problem is that it’s a really long tunnel.

Last week the American Gaming Association said the U.S. commercial gaming industry saw revenue hit a 17-year low of $30 billion in 2020 off by 31 percent from 2019. Everybody saw that coming and an optimistic point of view would be that now that most properties have reopened and are seeing casino floor capacities raised and customers returning there’s nowhere to go but up.

Look no further than MGM Resorts International for a taste of that optimism as the company last week announced that it is ready to go back to 24/7 operations at The Mirage Mandalay Bay and Park MGM beginning March 3.

While some companies have focused on keeping their doors open and paying their slimmed-down staffs during the pandemic a few have begun investing in new technology infrastructure to better serve customers when they do return.

Boyd Gaming Corp. collaborating with Aristocrat Technologies announced last week that it is on the verge of rolling out a “digital wallet” on a mobile app that is linked to Boyd’s B Connected loyalty program.

Similarly Golden Entertainment Inc. the company behind The Strat Arizona Charlie’s and the PT’s Pub franchise will debut Quick Play with Konami Gaming tying in with Golden’s True Rewards program.

During an earnings call last week Boyd lamented how rough 2020 has been for the company. The strength of Boyd’s regional properties portfolio has mitigated some of the damage hitting the company’s Las Vegas locals properties.

Boyd still hasn’t opened Main Street Station in downtown Las Vegas and the Eastside Cannery on Boulder Highway and the company has been hammered downtown in a market segment that it has dominated for years — the Hawaiian Islanders.

The addition of special quarantine protocols for travel between the islands and the mainland have wreaked havoc with that key Boyd market. Boyd has perfected the pipeline between Hawaii and downtown Las Vegas over time so the return to normalcy can’t come too soon for that company.

Boyd and its locals casino rivals Station Casinos have weathered the pandemic relatively well just as gaming industry analysts predicted. Boyd and Station’s parent company Red Rock Resorts were among the rare number of casino companies that registered a fourth-quarter earnings profit.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season a little more than halfway complete the locals and regional companies are surviving better than their Strip counterparts mainly because the amenities the Strip is so famous for — quality entertainment fabulous restaurants big-time professional sports and renowned spas — are shut down or extremely limited by the government’s virus protocols.

In the fourth quarter the largest Las Vegas companies — Las Vegas Sands Corp. MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd. — have collectively lost more than $1 billion. (Caesars Entertainment Inc. is scheduled to report Thursday.)

The airlines that fly tourists to Las Vegas aren’t doing much better with Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. collectively posting close to $1 billion in losses.

Now we’re ready to turn the page. It appears that state health leaders and the government are finally on track to deliver vaccinations and that the public has become more receptive to getting the shots.

There’s light at the end of that long tunnel. and it’s going to take a little more perseverance to reach it.

Although Berchelt was able to come back in rounds six seven and eight Valdez got his second wind in the ninth and dropped him. In the tenth Valdez knocked Berchelt out with a left hand that toppled him over.

In the co-feature bout undefeated junior lightweight Gabriel Flores Jr. (20-0 7 KOs) looked sensational with a 6th round knockout over Jayson Velez (29-8-1 21 KOs).

The 20-year-old Stockton California native Flores Jr 20 knocked Velez down in the sixth and then finished him after the action resumed. Referee Tony Weeks stopped the fight at 1:47 of the round.

2012 Olympian Esquiva Falcao (28-0 20 KOs) beat two-time middleweight world title challenger Artur Akavov (20-4 9 KOs) by a fourth-round stoppage. The fight was stopped after the 35-year-old Akavov sustained a broken nose and was unable to continue.

Early results:

Elvis Rodriguez defeated Luis Alberto Veron by an eight-round unanimous decision. The scores were as follows 78-74 79-73 79-73. The 25-year-old southpaw Rodriguez (11-0-1 10 KOs) saw his eight-fight knockout streak end.

Preview:

Miguel Berchelt defends against Oscar Valdez tonight in a fight that expected to be a ‘Fight of the Year’ candidate on ESPN and ESPN+ in a match-up behind closed doors inside ‘The Bubble’ at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas Nevada.

Berchelt (37-1 33 KOs) will have his WBC 130-lb title at stake against his hungry challenger Valdez (28-0 22 KOs) in a fight that many boxing fans view as a toss-up despite the fact that Miguel is a slight favorite.

Undefeated super featherweight Gabriel Flores Jr (19-0 6 KOs) will be taking on the highly experienced Jayson Valdez (29-7-1 21 KOs) in the chief support bout. The 20-year-old Flores Jr has a lot of talent but not much in the way of punching power.

Boxing fans will get to judge for themselves how talented Berchelt is because he’s someone that Top Rank has been high on for years but he’s not had good enough competition until now to really test him and give him some badly needed notoriety.

If Berchelt wins this fight Bob Arum says he wants to match him against Shakur Stevenson soon. Arum believes that Stevenson will beat Berchelt.

Many boxing fans would disagree with Arum on that because Stevenson isn’t much of a puncher and he would have to develop his man-strength in a hurry for him not to fall victim to Berchelt.

Valdez is a live dog in this fight tonight and it won’t be surprising if he figures out Berchelt’s style and beats him. It won’t be easy but it’s possible. Miguel Roman gave Berchelt a lot of trouble as did Takashi Miura.

For Valdez to have a shot at beating Berchelt he’s going to need to be able to take the huge shots that he’ll be landing.

With any fighter if someone can take their power and stay in there with them to land their own shots they have a chance at winning. In Valdez’s case it’s not a good sign that he’s been hurt in four out of his last seven fights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yMS9zcGEtbWFuZGFsYXktbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXN0cmlwLW1hc3NhZ2UtZmFjaWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indulge in some body bliss at Spa Mandalay in Las Vegas,"The island vibe that envelops Mandalay Bay extends to its gorgeous and grand 30000-square-foot Spa Mandalay.

That’s what happened with Oscar Valdez on Saturday.

Valdez an underdog against highly regarded Miguel Berchelt took his fellow Mexican apart before stopping him with a monstrous left hook in the 10th round to take Berchelt’s 130-pound title at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Valdez (29-0 23 KOs) was a respected contender entering the fight – he’s a former featherweight titleholder – but he had looked so-so in his past few fights. Meanwhile Berchelt (37-2 33 KOs) was making the seventh defense of his WBC title. All but one of his successful defenses ended inside the distance a testament to his punching power.

Hence the odds in Berchelt’s favor around 3½-1 at the opening bell.

The problem for Berchelt is that the best possible version of Valdez showed up on Saturday. He was too quick too athletic and – surprise surprise – much too powerful for one of the sport’s most-feared knockout artists.

Valdez opened the fight boxing cautiously jabbing throwing power shots here and there taking his time. Then about two minutes into Round 4 Valdez hurt Berchelt with a left hook and it was downhill for the then-champion.

Valdez continued to throw – and land – big shots including another left hook that sent Berchelt into the ropes for the first knockdown in the final seconds of the round.

Berchelt regained his footing by the middle of Round 5 and had his best rounds in six and seven in which he put heavy pressure on Valdez and landed enough punches to give himself hope of climbing back into the fight.

However Valdez got back to landing hard shots in Round 8 and then put Berchelt down again in Round 9 courtesy of a right uppercut followed by a left-right-left combination. Berchelt got up and survived but he was struggling.

Then came the end. Valdez was in control of Round 10 when a split second before the bell rang Berchelt ran into a perfect left hook and fell flat on his face.

Referee Russell Mora didn’t bother to count waving off the fight immediately. The official time was 2:59.

Berchelt who was rolled onto his back by one of his handlers gave fans some scary moments as he lay motionless but he was able to walk to out of the ring with some help. He was later taken to a hospital.

For Valdez it was the performance of his career a dominating victory over one of the hottest fighters in the world that gave him a coveted championship belt. To say that it was a defining moment for him is an understatement.

He was understandably ecstatic after the fight. And defiant.

“There’s nothing better than proving people wrong” he said. “I have a list of people who doubted me. My idols doubted me. Boxing analysts doubted me. They said Miguel Berchelt was going to knock me out.

“I got a message to tell everybody: Don’t let nobody tell you what you can and can’t do. Always work hard and be disciplined in life try to do your best and anything is possible.”

Valdez was asked who he wants next but was still in the moment.

“I don’t know” he said. “… Any champion out there. I heard that Shakur Stevenson wants to fight. Let’s do it. I just want to keep on fighting and give the fans what they want.”

The fans want to witness great fights and great performances like the one Valdez gave them on Saturday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjAvb3NjYXItdmFsZGV6LWZvbGxvd3MtdXAtaGlzLXNraWxsLXdpdGgtYS1zY2FyeS1rbm9ja291dC1vZi1taWd1ZWwtYmVyY2hlbHQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9vc2Nhci12YWxkZXotZm9sbG93cy11cC1oaXMtc2tpbGwtd2l0aC1hLXNjYXJ5LWtub2Nrb3V0LW9mLW1pZ3VlbC1iZXJjaGVsdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oscar Valdez follows up his skill with a scary knockout of Miguel Berchelt,"Miguel Berchelt and Oscar Valdez exchange punches during their fight for the WBC super featherweight title at the MGM Grand Conference Center on February 20 2021 in Las Vegas Nevada.

Boxing displayed its rare ability to inspire and terrify sometimes within the same round on Saturday night.

Oscar Valdez was in the middle of a brilliant deconstruction of Miguel Berchelt the favored WBC super featherweight champion. Then as the bell was just beginning to toll at the end of the 10th round Berchelt missed a lunging right and Valdez pounded him in the middle of the face with a left hook from boxing hell.

Berchelt was out cold before he hit the floor and Valdez now 29-0 was the new champ. It was his 23rd knockout and was built carefully from the ground floor by Valdez and trainer Eddy Reynoso.

“I thought Berchelt would bring out the best in me” Valdez said. “I can also box I can do a lot of things. It wasn’t a toe to toe fight and I had to box a little more. But like I told my opponents be careful if you’re looking for the knockout. You might find one yourself.”

But it was difficult to analyze everything when one saw Berchelt motionless on the canvas for at least a minute and a half. After he sat up and regained his senses he was strapped onto a gurney and shoved into the back of an ambulance. Berchelt was released from the hospital and a CT scan showed no damage to his brain.

It was Valdez’s third knockdown of the fight. In between Rounds 9 and 10 referee Russell Mora told Berchelt’s corner that he needed to see some competitiveness if he was going to prolong the fight. Valdez rocked Berchelt repeatedly during the round and even though the champ was technically not defenseless his legs were collapsing and his gait was unsteady. A stoppage would have been quite in line with boxing’s standards as well as humanity’s.

Berchelt is now 38-2 overall and 7-1 in title shots. He has taken massive punishment before as in the victory over Francisco Vargas that he used to win the title in 2017 but Valdez was too strategic and measured to let him escape.

“I want to thank all the people who said I couldn’t do it because they’re part of this too” Valdez said.

Valdez was the underdog because he was on the wrong end of a 5½-inch reach disadvantage and because many fans believed he would abandon his new calculating style when things got hot. But Berchelt seemed slower than usual. Perhaps it wasn’t the best idea to add 16 pounds following Friday’s weigh-in when both boxers reached the 130-pound limit on the nose.

Valdez established his left jab in the first three rounds and found ways to duck under and around Berchelt’s shots. Once he gained confidence Valdez rocked Berchelt with a left hand to the temple in the fourth round and got his first knockdown.

Berchelt gathered himself quickly and was the more effective man in the sixth and seventh rounds. But Valdez combined a left hook and a right uppercut to floor Berchelt in the ninth. There were no more comebacks forthcoming.

“I’ve been doing that in other fights but people say they haven’t seen it” Valdez said. “I wasn’t doing it as often in the fights. I didn’t get hit with a single shot when I went southpaw. It gave him something else to think about and it made it tougher on him.”

The end was disquieting and entirely foreseeable. The shot was so mercilessly clean that it sent Teofimo Lopez the lightweight champion screaming from his seat into the wings at the Top Rank bubble in Las Vegas.

“I almost feel like I should do a backflip like Teofimo” Valdez joked.

He had already stuck the landing of a lifetime.

By creating kinks in the structure of graphene researchers at the University of Sussex have made the nanomaterial behave like a transistor and have shown that when a strip of graphene is crinkled in this way it can behave like a microchip which is around 100 times smaller than conventional microchips.



Prof Alan Dalton in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Sussex said: “We’re mechanically creating kinks in a layer of graphene. It’s a bit like nano-origami.



“Using these nanomaterials will make our computer chips smaller and faster. It is absolutely critical that this happens as computer manufacturers are now at the limit of what they can do with traditional semiconducting technology. Ultimately this will make our computers and phones thousands of times faster in the future.



“This kind of technology – “straintronics” using nanomaterials as opposed to electronics – allows space for more chips inside any device. Everything we want to do with computers – to speed them up – can be done by crinkling graphene like this.”

Dr Manoj Tripathi Research Fellow in Nano-structured Materials at the University of Sussex and lead author on the paper said: “Instead of having to add foreign materials into a device we’ve shown we can create structures from graphene and other 2D materials simply by adding deliberate kinks into the structure. By making this sort of corrugation we can create a smart electronic component like a transistor or a logic gate.""



The development is a greener more sustainable technology. Because no additional materials need to be added and because this process works at room temperature rather than high temperature it uses less energy to create.

With remote work becoming the norm as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic companies realised that their conventional security architecture was not best-equipped to deal with a distributed workforce.

Mobility distributed work and the growing use of cloud solutions have brought huge benefits in scalability and cost. But they expanded the security perimeter bringing new challenges.

Take the example of Infosys India’s second-largest information technology services firm with close to 250000 employees. While readying to support employees working from home last year it realised that its security architecture needed changing. Indeed the company undertook multiple changes to its security architect in 2020.

All signatories -- Facebook Google Microsoft Redbubble TikTok and Twitter – have committed to the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. They have also committed to releasing an annual transparency report about their efforts under the code.

The code [PDF] was prepared by the Digital Industry Group Inc (DiGi) a non-profit industry association advocating for the digital industry in Australia.

In December 2019 the Australian government asked the digital industry to develop the code in response to policy as set out in Regulating in the Digital Age: Government Response and Implementation Roadmap for the Digital Platforms Inquiry. DiGi volunteered to develop the draft for the industry.

The code asks signatories to be cognisant of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights when developing proportionate responses to disinformation and misinformation.

It provides seven guiding principles with the first aimed at protecting freedom of expression.

""Signatories should not be compelled by governments or other parties to remove content solely on the basis of its alleged falsity if the content would not otherwise be unlawful"" the code said.

Another is centred on protecting user privacy and notes that any actions taken by digital platforms to address the propagation of disinformation and misinformation should not contravene commitments they have made to respect the privacy of Australian users.

DiGi explained that the code should be adopted without prejudice to other initiatives aimed at tackling disinformation and misinformation by digital platforms.

""Empowering users"" is another principle that is to enable users to make informed choices about digital media content that purports to be a source of authoritative current news or of factual information.

Signatories also commited to supporting independent researchers and having policies and processes concerning advertising placements implemented.

The final guiding principle dictates that digital platforms should communicate on the effectiveness of efforts to ensure the integrity and security of their services and products by taking steps to prohibit detect and take action against inauthentic accounts on their services and products whose purpose is to propagate disinformation.

The code will apply to certain products and services that are delivered to end users in Australia such as user-generated sponsored and shared content as well as content that is returned and ranked by search engines in response to user queries.

Private messaging services email services and enterprise services are excluded from the code.

Other excluded content includes those that are produced in good faith for entertainment including satire and parody or for educational purposes; content authorised by an Australian state or federal government; political advertising or content authorised by a political party registered under Australian law; and news content that is the subject of a published editorial code.

While political advertising is not misinformation or disinformation for the purposes of the code signatories are required to develop and implement policies that provide users with greater transparency about the source of political advertising carried on digital platforms.

""Signatories may also as a matter of policy choose not to target advertisements based on the inferred political affiliations of a user"" the code noted.

The code is ""opt-in"" and participants can withdraw their commitment. Within six months of signing signatories must have a complaints handling process in place.

DiGi said it plans to establish a sub-committee comprising representatives from signatories and independent members who will meet at six-monthly intervals to review the actions of signatories and monitor how they are meeting their commitments under the code.

The code will be reviewed in 12 months.

While high-connectivity is widely available today 3G and 4G cellular networks often limit the quality of conversation with over 50% packet loss and sporadic loss of coverage explain Microsoft's Jigar Dani and Sriram Srinivasan. Additionally reducing the bandwidth required by audio conversation has the benefit of increasing the bandwidth available for other concurrent tasks by the same users or other people sharing the same network connection.

After all these years it turns out that utilization of available bitrate is every bit as important today as it was in the dial-up world.

According to Dani and Srinivasan Satin can cover frequencies up to 16KHz which is dubbed ""super wide band"" and doubles the usual 8KHz bandwidth used for human speech sampling at just 6kbps. As a comparison Silk could only provide a 4KHz bandwidth at the same 6kbps bitrate.

This improvement is made possible by a two-fold approach: on the encoding end only a sparse representation of the audio signal is processed. This is made possible by more advanced models of speech production and psychoacoustics. On the decoding end instead:

Satin uses deep neural networks to estimate the high band parameters from the received low band parameters and a minimal amount of side information sent over the wire.

Microsoft hasn't released many additional details about their approach with bandwidth extension through the use of a neural network (DNN) but a similar technique is used by Google WaveNet text-to-speech synthesizer. In WaveNet's case a DNN is trained to upsample to 24KHz an audio signal filtered through a 8KHz codec. The signal reconstructed using this DNN has only slightly lower quality to that of a 16KHz-filtered audio signal.

Microsoft's approach with Satin whatever it looks like in detail poses a computational challenge explain Microsoft engineers since both the encoding and the decoding steps are computationally intensive.

To solve this the team then focused on both algorithmic optimizations as well as techniques like loop vectorization beyond what the compiler could achieve. This achieved nearly 40% reduction in computational complexity and allowed us to run on all our users’ devices.

To evaluate Satin impact Microsoft has carried through A/B tests showing that at low bitrates Satin has enabled longer calls and received a 1.7 MOS higher opinion score than Silk.

As a final remark Satin also outperforms Silk as to packet loss which is quite a common occurrence over Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Here Microsoft's engineers explain its approach of encoding each packet separately is what makes a difference since losing a packet does not affect subsequent packets.

At the moment Satin is being used for Teams and Skype calls and will extend to Teams meetings soon. In future says Microsoft it will support full-band stereo music at a maximum sampling rate of 48KHz starting at a bitrate of 17kbps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9ob3ctaG9sb2xlbnMtaGVscGluZy1zdXJnZW9ucy13b3JrLXRvZ2V0aGVyLWFjcm9zcy10aG91c2FuZHMtbWlsZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Microsoft HoloLens is helping surgeons work together across thousands of miles,"What you need to know

Surgeons around the world are using the HoloLens to collaborate and communicate during operations.

An initiative to use the HoloLens in surgery spanned across 13 countries and five continents.

The HoloLens also serves as a tool for bringing up information within a sterile environment.

Microsoft's HoloLens is being used in operating rooms to help surgeons communicate collaborate and pull up information during procedures. Dr. Bruno Gobbato a self-described ""tech guy"" and ""geek"" is part of a group of surgeons using the HoloLens augmented reality headset.

In a story told by a Microsoft news post Gobbato worked with Professor Thomas Gregory in Paris and Dr. John Erickson in New Jersey while performing surgery in Jaraguá do Sul Brazil. Gobbato used a HoloLens 2 Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Microsoft Teams to work together with the experts during the surgery.

In the operating room the HoloLens isn't just a tool for collaboration and communication. It's a sterile option that can act as a smartphone without requiring any physical contact. Surgeons can't just type away on a keyboard and use a mouse when they're in an operating room because operating rooms need to be sterile.

""I realized that I was able to use the HoloLens as a computer or a smartphone to get any information I need when I need it during surgery. That allows surgeons to be quicker to be more efficient and to improve performance"" said Gregory.

Gregory also performed the first surgery that utilized a HoloLens back in 2017 so he has history improving medical procedures with the device. Gregory came up with a project to use the HoloLens 2 to help doctors around the world. The initiative has involved orthopedic surgeons from 13 countries across five continents.

Another doctor involved with the project Dr. John Sledge said ""It's an enormously limited data set that's available to me."" He continues ""With the HoloLens I can pull up the images I want and make them bigger as needed. I've got all the images I need literally right in front of me in whatever size and clarity that I need them to be.""

Gregory sees the HoloLens as a vital tool for surgery. ""With HoloLens we've got a tool to democratize this digital revolution in all of the operating theaters around the world. The impact of this is massive. I think in the future surgeons will not be able to perform a surgery without HoloLens.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy90aGlzLW5ldy1taWNyb3NvZnQtd29yZC1mZWF0dXJlLWlzLWJvdW5kLXRvLWJlLWEtaGl0LWVzcGVjaWFsbHktd2l0aC1zbG93LXR5cGlzdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This new Microsoft Word feature is bound to be a hit especially with slow typists,"Microsoft is working on a new feature for Word that should help users compose documents more quickly and with greater ease.

As per an entry in the company’s product roadmap Word will soon receive a text predictions feature designed to anticipate what the user intends to write next and save them the effort of typing it out in full.

Once the update has been deployed Word will begin to generate text predictions in real-time as the user types. These predictions will be greyed out until either typed over approved using the TAB key or rejected using ESC.

According to Microsoft the service will improve over time as it picks up on each user’s writing style and linguistic preferences and should help minimize errors of spelling and grammar.

The feature is currently still under development but is expected to roll out for users of the Windows application by the end of next month. It is unclear when the upgrade will land for the web client or Word for macOS.

The upcoming Word update will restore parity between Microsoft’s word processing software and rival service Google Docs  which has offered almost identical functionality for a while now.

While Microsoft had previously been the undisputed leader in the productivity software market the transition to a subscription-first model and the rise of Google Workspace has introduced a healthy measure of competition to the space.

Information about the new Word feature also comes hot on the heels of an announcement about the company’s next standalone Office package designed for customers that prefer to make a one-time purchase as opposed to using the Microsoft 365 subscription service.

Set to arrive later this year Office 2021 will presumably deliver a range of upgrades over the previous 2019 edition but Microsoft remains tight-lipped about the precise ways in which the two standalone packages will differ.

Microsoft has confirmed that Office 2021 will receive support for five years and the company does not intend to alter the price of the package at the current time."

The team – from Nference in Cambridge Massachusetts and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota –says the findings are on par with the results reported in large phase 3 randomized clinical trials.

The results showed that the vaccines are effective at both preventing infection and reducing the severity of COVID-19.

Venky Soundararajan and colleagues also demonstrate that vaccination effectively protects individuals at the highest risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing severe disease.

“Building upon the previous randomized trials of these vaccines this study demonstrates their real-world effectiveness in reducing the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among individuals at the highest risk for infection” write the researchers.

A pre-print version of the research paper is available on the medRxiv* server while the article undergoes peer review.

This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication. Since its initial publication the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal.

The two vaccines are being rolled out across the United States

In 2020 large phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated that the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine is 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and that the Moderna mRNA1273 vaccine is 94.1% effective.

Both of these vaccines are now being rolled-out across the Unites States with priority given to those at high risk of infection or severe disease.

However “while these groups were not excluded from the phase 3 trials vaccine efficacy has not been specifically demonstrated among them” says Soundararajan and colleagues.

“It is thus critical to analyze outcomes of vaccinated patients to date to determine whether these vaccines are indeed effective in especially high-risk individuals.”

Schematic illustrating the algorithms for participant selection and outcome assessment. (A) Design of study to compare SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in patients receiving COVID-19 vaccination compared to 1-to-1 propensity-matched unvaccinated patients (n = 31069 per group). For each group incidence rates were calculated to assess the efficacy of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection as defined by a positive PCR test with onset at least 36 days after the first dose or the date of study enrollment. Several other time windows were also evaluated for vaccine efficacy. (B) Design of study to compare COVID-19 disease severity in patients who were vaccinated prior to diagnosis with COVID-19 and had at least 14 days of follow-up after diagnosis (n = 191) versus 1-to-10 propensity-matched unvaccinated patients with at least 14 days of follow-up (n = 2348). Severity outcomes (hospitalization ICU admission and mortality) were assessed within 14 days of PCR diagnosis.

What did the current study involve?

Now the team has conducted a preliminary assessment of real-world vaccination outcomes in 62138 individuals within the Mayo Clinic health system (including Arizona Florida Minnesota Wisconsin) between 1st December 2020 and 8th February 2021.

The researchers assessed SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity among 31069 individuals who received at least one dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine.

“One challenge inherent to such real-world analyses is the lack of a built-in placebo arm which is essential to establish the expected infection rate during the study period and thereby to assess vaccine efficacy” writes Soundararajan and colleagues.

To address this shortcoming the researchers used 1-to-1 propensity score matching to generate a cohort of 31069 individuals who did not receive a vaccine by the end of the study period.

Distribution of the time from first vaccine dose to first positive PCR test for the patients with at least one positive PCR test following vaccination. Patient counts for mRNA-1273 (Moderna vaccine) are shown in black and patient counts for BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) are shown in purple. For mRNA-1273 the mean time to positive PCR test following the first dose is 10.9 days (standard deviation: 6.9 days) and for BNT162b2 the mean time to positive PCR test following the first dose is 12.1 days (standard deviation: 9.1 days). Dotted lines indicate the recommended time for the second vaccine dose for mRNA-1273 (28 days) and BNT162b2 (21 days).

Vaccine efficacy reached 88.7%

Starting 36 days following study enrollment the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among individuals who received two vaccines was 0.048 cases per 1000 person-days compared with 0.43 cases per 1000 days among unvaccinated individuals.

This corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 88.7% which the team says is in line with the previously reported efficacies.

Even in the first seven days following enrollment the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly lower among vaccinated individuals than among unvaccinated individuals (0.48 versus 1.0 case per 1000 days) corresponding to an efficacy of 53.6%.

Efficacy then increased over subsequent weeks and reached its maximum during the sixth week after study enrollment.

How did disease severity compare between the two groups?

Among the vaccinated individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the 14-day hospitalization rate was significantly lower than among the unvaccinated individuals who tested positive at 3.7% versus 9.2%.

On the other hand ICU admission rates were similar between the two cohorts at 1.0% versus 1.3% as were 14-day mortality rates at 0.0% versus 0.085%.

However the team says it is worth noting that none of the vaccinated patients who developed COVID-19 have died including 59 individuals who were followed up for at least 28 days.

“A strong real-world effect” of vaccination

“Our data demonstrate a strong real-world effect of COVID-19 vaccination on par with the results reported in each randomized trial” writes Soundararajan and colleagues. “We emphasize that COVID-19 vaccines should be administered as broadly and rapidly as possible to the public and that the real-world efficacy of these vaccines should be continuously monitored as we move beyond Phase 1a of the distribution process” concludes the team.

On Feb. 8 The New York Times published a story on the case of 72-year-old Luz Legaspi who was hospitalized with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) a day after she received the drug on Jan. 18. ITP is a disorder that can lead to excessive bleeding or bruising because of the shortage of platelets — also called thrombocytes — or blood cells that form clots to stop bleeding.

The blood disorder has occurred in at least 36 people in the United States who got inoculated with either Moderna or Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine according to news reports. Health experts and authorities say a direct link between the drugs and ITP remains uncertain.

Legaspi who was hospitalized for two weeks at Elmhurst Hospital has since gone home and her platelet count has steadily increased the Times reported.

Photos of Legaspi while in the hospital with bruises on her arms and legs have been making the rounds on the Web this week and are being used by some netizens to discourage others from getting inoculated against the coronavirus disease 2019.

Among the most popular posts using Legaspi’s case as a warning was published on Feb. 15 by an FB user. It got over 8000 shares before it was taken down.

Prior to Legaspi’s case an obstetrician from Florida who received a jab of Pfizer’s vaccine on Dec. 18 developed a similar condition and died 16 days later from a brain hemorrhage.

ITP cases under investigation

The New York Times reported that officials from the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating the reported cases of ITP in COVID-19 vaccine recipients.

The agencies were also reported as saying that the cases could be “coincidental” since the rates of the vaccinated people with the condition “did not appear higher than the rates normally found in the U.S. population.”

The vaccine maker Moderna was quoted in the Times story as saying that it “continuously monitors the safety of its COVID-19 vaccine using all sources of data.”

Pfizer-BioNTech on the other hand which uses the same mRNA technology as Moderna for its vaccine said in a statement it takes reports of adverse events very seriously and that it was aware of the ITP cases.

“We are collecting relevant information to share with the F.D.A. However at this time we have not been able to establish a causal association with our vaccine” Pfizer added.

The two are the only drugs that were granted emergency use authorization in the United States so far.

A team of health experts and researchers convened by global nonprofit organization Meedan told VERA Files Fact Check on Feb. 19: “It is too soon to know whether or not the timing of ITP and COVID-19 vaccination were coincidental in these cases. It’s also not clear if vaccination led to an exacerbation of pre-existing unrecognized ITP or if the vaccination caused ITP.”

The benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine for people with no pre-existing ITP “strongly outweighs” the risks of avoiding vaccination out of fear of developing the condition the experts said.

“ITP has also been observed as a possible reaction to COVID-19 among those without the vaccine at much higher rates than following the vaccine. Up to 10% of patients with mild disease and 20% in those who are severely affected” they added.

Doctors also say that for those with preexisting ITP it is best to consult with a hematologist and obtain a platelet count before getting vaccinated.

A rite of passage if you will falling somewhere between a 16th birthday and buying your first house. Grateful to be away from any wandering curious eyes in the campus library I took a deep breath and hit the “join now” button on LinkedIn.

Arguably the most important component of college is figuring out who you are and what you want to do with your life. I spent most of my first year of college simply trying to navigate my new environment — getting accustomed to college-level coursework and living on my own for the first time. I assumed my peers were doing the same.

Then I joined LinkedIn.

I can’t believe I used to think the fear of missing out from Instagram was bad. LinkedIn is infinitely worse.

Seeing what feels like everyone I went to high school with announcing their internships at Morgan Stanley flooded me with the distinct feeling of being left behind.

Having worked only service jobs in high school I felt a massive gap between my prior work experience and what I viewed as the real world. Until then the future had felt like a distant fuzzy figure on the horizon and all of a sudden it seemed that everyone around me was already there.

What had I been doing while my peers crafted seemingly perfect futures? Why was everyone’s profile expertly formulated yet I hadn’t heard a word about it from a single friend? How in the middle of a pandemic would I begin to catch up?

What I didn’t know as I frantically Googled “What is a cover letter” is that plenty of people my age felt the same way.

When I settled down enough to actually read one of the emails from Lehigh’s Career Center I came to the comforting realization that there is no recipe for career satisfaction. In fact no one I know has it 100 percent figured out.

I believe college is supposed to be about not getting it right the first time. Now I apply that principle to my professional future as well.

Through conversations with friends and mentors I no longer feel the suffocating pressure of a life plan. Instead I’m confident enough in my studies and abilities to know what I bring to the table.

I think much of why I hadn’t had these conversations before is due to a culture of secrecy around career advancement. Maybe I’m missing some competitive gene or maybe I’m just naive but assuming we all want the same thing—to live happy and fulfilled lives—wouldn’t it be so much easier to just help each other get there?

Now I treat every application as practice and every “failed” interview as a learning experience. I find comfort in knowing that my path is my own and that I may wake up in 50 years and laugh at the life 20-year-old me thought I wanted.

Currently I’m just grateful to be able to have the opportunity to study what I love. For right now that’s enough for me.

Also the reality is that access to professional positions is not as equitable as we may wish it to be. Not everyone has the luxury of working an unpaid internship for the sake of experience and connections continue to play a significant role in the hiring process.

It’s important to acknowledge these factors when we’re stalking classmate’s LinkedIn pages and to respect each other enough to refrain from judgement.

We’re all doing the best we can.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL2Vjb25vbXktZ3Jvd3RoLXBhbmRlbWljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the U.S. economy could be poised for unfamiliar era,"U.S. economy may have its best chance in years to break from era of subpar growth

Pairings for 1st FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship Quarterfinals (Feb 21 15:00 UTC):



SBER – ERG

Sberbank Trade Union – Emphie Solutions

Grenke Bank – Anahuac

Morgan Stanley (HUN) – PT Pelabuhan Tanjung Priok

Those who like sensations are likely to be disappointed by the outcome in most of the Eastern pools but the good thing about chess is that the strongest players have plenty of opportunities to prove their superiority whereas some accidental results rarely change the course of events.

East A

The fight for first place ended already in Round 4 after SBER whitewashed RIVC-Pulkovo. In Rounds 5 and 6 SBER didn't concede even a half-point to their rivals either although in the final round Maria Komyagina playing on the fourth board was down 3 (!) pawns in a rook endgame. The main favourite finished the group stage with a record score of 22½ out of 24. The RIVC-Pulkovo had bad luck with the draw as in any other pool this team would have been a strong candidate for first place and qualifying for playoffs.

Final standings

East B

It all came down to the confrontation between Grenke Bank and Yandex in this pool. The teams advanced on parallel courses and eventually clashed in Round 5. Grenke Bank won by a minimal margin - Georg Meier held Yandex's IT specialist Dmitry Jakovenko to a draw on the first board while Alina Kashlinskaya and Hanna Marie Klek scored victories on the second and third boards secured a playoff berth for the German team. Yandex chess players were so upset by this defeat that they also lost the last round match. As a result Samsung Electronics (POL) which stayed below the radar throughout the event finished second. A strong performance by VOZP (CZE) and Khareba (GEO) is also noteworthy.

Final standings

East C

The battle for the top spot in East C resembled desperate attempts of the wind to topple a mountain by attacking it from different directions. The Morgan Stanley (HUN) team acted as this mountain. Every round one of the pursuers came close to the Hungarian financiers but they were thrown back after head-to-head matches time and again. Anish Giri and his Optiver teammates made the final attempt to rob Morgan Stanley of the quarterfinal spot - unfortunately only the Dutch team's leader managed to deliver in this battle. The Hungarian team won all their matches claiming first place in the pool 2½ ahead of Gazprom (second place).

Final standings

East D

In the East D pool Sberbank Trade Union was unstoppable and deservedly took the qualification spot. The international squad of GM Anton Korobov (UKR) FM Evgenij Kretov (RUS) FM Fedor Myshakov (UKR) and WFM Elena Homyakova (BLR) won all the matches and dropped just 4½ game points on the way to the quarterfinals. The pool winners started eliminating their rivals on day one crushing Paypal (BUL) and did not stop on day two defeating Slav Group and Dassault Systemes.

Final standings

East E

With just two rounds to go it looked like CSOB (CZE) was bound to win the East E pool given that the rating favourites BCG Gamma were not living up to expectations. CSOB topped the standings throughout the event up to the point of squaring off against ERG (KAZ) which obviously had another agenda. Originally seeded #3 the team headed by GM Anuar Ismagambetov started the tournament with a draw in the very first round but gradually gained momentum and crushed the leaders in the penultimate-round match. In Round 6 the Kazakhstani players consolidated their position by defeating Gordic 3:1 leaving CSOB 1½ game points behind.

Final standings

East F

The East F pool turned into a race between the rating favourites Emphie Solutions (POL) and State Bank of Mongolia. The two teams faced off in Round 4 but did not determine the winner. GM Batchuluun Tsegmid on the first board and WFM Munkhzul Davaakhuu on board four won their games for the Mongolian team (they went on to win all their games in the tournament). The Polish team bounced back on boards two and three with the victory of rating underdog Wojciech Reza over IM Batkhuyag Munguntuul being especially valuable.

Entering the final round Emphie Solutions trailed State Bank of Mongolia by one point. Poles managed to make the most of their match whitewashing Czech National Bank 4:0. State Bank of Mongolia had an arguably tougher opponent RFSO Lokomotiv (RUS) headed by IM Polina Shuvalova. Putting a much weaker player on board two to score points on boards three and four was a strategy that worked well for the Mongolian team as long as IM Batkhuyag Munguntuul would sweep through the field on board three but this did not work out in the end. The Mongolians conceded 1½ precious game points in the last round match (a defeat on board two and a draw on board three) and let Emphie Solutions leapfrog them by a mere half-point!

Final standings

West A

After the main favourites of Pool West A Microsoft Redmond (USA) and Anahuac (MEX) drew their match in Round 3 it became clear that one mistake made by one of the leaders in the encounters with less strong teams would be decisive. Unfortunately Microsoft messed up not just a single game but the entire match – in Round 5 the team lost to Goldman Sachs 1:3 with their leader Francesco Rambaldi simply leaving his queen en prize as a result of some kind of hallucination. After that defeat it was all in the hands of the Mexican team. Anahuac did not miss this opportunity and punched the ticket into the playoff.

Final standings

West B

Unlike West A in West B the key match between the leaders American Express (USA) and PT Pelabuhan Tanjung Priok (INA) was played on the second day in Round 4. Alas it was a lopsided battle – the Indonesian team was much stronger. As a result the fate of a spot in the quarterfinals was sealed with two rounds to go.

The winners played some nice games although Ali Muhammad Lutfi the leader of PT Pelabuhan Tanjung Priok acted as a co-author in the most spectacular one. Facing Ali Muhammad Lutfi Janusz Kudelka played the game of his life.

Janusz KudelkaJanusz Kudelka – Ali Muhammad Lutfi



White is carrying out a frenzied attack but had the opponent interposed with his bishop on the previous move (20…Bf6) the soundness of sacrifices would have been in question. However after 20…Nf6 everything fell into place:

A collection of environmental and community groups has asked the Biden administration's U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to begin what they say is an overdue review of the material known as phosphogypsum. That review could end up having it declared a hazardous waste require new health testing of its effects and block the Trump administration's decision last fall to let the waste be used for road base in government projects.

Blizzard’s latest online convention begun yesterday with an array of reveals for many of its games merchandise and more. Some of the more eagle-eyed amongst you may have even noticed a cameo from what looks like a certain plastic brick towards the end of one panel.

Near the finish of the ‘behind the scenes of Overwatch 2’ panel a glimpse at the development studio was revealed with clips of workspaces wall art and more shown. However among the art installations was a floor to ceiling mosaic of some pixelated key art from the sequel. Thankfully a closer shot of the artwork is shown revealing more details.

When looking at this better view it seems that the pixels appear to have cylindrical bumps on each of them. Of course we’ve seen such a design before and it appears that this particular artwork is an enormous LEGO mosaic.

Although it may appear to be made of LEGO bricks it should be stated that there is no confirmation that these pieces are from the LEGO Group and not a rival brand but considering the relationship and past sets with the companies it seems likely that these are indeed the iconic bricks.

With the LEGO Overwatch theme seemingly cancelled it might be strange to see the relationship between Blizzard and the LEGO Group continuing in any form and this might just be a commission or gift from one company to another. However with the rumour of one more LEGO Overwatch set this does bring about the ongoing question of whether the theme will return for the sequel.

For now we can only wait and see but the LEGO Group has created similar-sized builds before to promote the theme.

Procon notified the credit information multinational following the emergence of a leak that exposed the personal data of more than 220 million citizens as well as companies currently offered for sale in the dark web. Security firm PSafe discovered the incident which exposed all manner of personal details including information from Mosaic a consumer segmentation model used by Serasa Experian's Brazilian subsidiary.

Following the emergence of the leak in January Procon notified the credit bureau and asked the company for a confirmation of the incident and an explanation of the reasons that caused the leak the steps taken to contain it how it will repair the damage to consumers impacted and the measures taken to prevent it from happening again.

""No hypothesis has been ruled out and at the moment we consider it is more likely that the leak came from inside companies rather than hackers"" said Procon's executive director Fernando Capez adding that Experian's feedback prompts more questions than answers. The explanations from the company will be analyzed by the board of the consumer rights body and a fine may be applicable if any wrongdoing becomes evident.

According to Procon Experian informed that all its activities that involve personal data comply with the Brazilian data protection regulations and that processing of such data can legally serve several purposes. That part of the answer was insufficient the consumer rights body said since ""there is no legal basis for the treatment and use of data in an indiscriminate manner"" and that includes data of deceased individuals also exposed in the leak.

In addition Procon noted that Serasa Experian did not specify the technical and organizational measures adopted to implement its data protection policy. Moreover the company reinforced what it had said in a statement released last week in its response to the notification that there is no evidence that credit data has been illegally obtained from its Brazilian subsidiary. The company also argued that there is no evidence that its technology systems had been compromised.

In relation to Serasa Experian's risk mitigation policy that may occur in such circumstances Procon said the company only stated that a ""comprehensive information security program"" is currently in place. Regarding damage repair to consumers Serasa Experian stated that its website has instructions on what to do in case of fraud. Procon's stance is that this is a preventive measure rather than a reparative action.

Contacted by ZDNet Serasa Experian did not answer to requests for comment on Procon's response to its feedback. The agency's demands for answers follow calls from the Brazilian Institute for Consumer Protection (IDEC) for urgent measures to investigate and punish those responsible for exposing the population's data as well as improved citizen information and transparency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHVyY2h0aW1lcy5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLzI2LWZlYnJ1YXJ5L25ld3MvdWsvbmV3LWNvYWxpdGlvbi1zZWVrcy1ncmVhdGVyLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1jbG91dC1pbi1jaHVyY2gtb2YtZW5nbGFuZC1kaW9jZXNlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New coalition seeks greater 'inclusive' clout in Church of England dioceses,"A NEW coalition describing itself as a “movement of supporting Anglicans for an inclusive Church” — and to be know by the acronym Mosaic — is to bring together campaigns on issues of race ability sexuality gender and gender identity.

One of its two co-chairs Canon Tim Goode a newly elected member of the Archbishops’ Council said that Mosaic represented “the full range of marginalised groups within the Church of England. We stand far stronger together — for you cannot be a little bit inclusive.”

The coalition draws together leaders from the Campaign for Equal Marriage Disability and Jesus Inclusive Church Modern Church One Body One Faith and the Ozanne Foundation. It hopes to grow to include other organisations.

Each of these bodies will continue to function independently but the coalition is an attempt to co-ordinate their efforts to eradicate discrimination from church statements policies appointments and actions

The other co-chair is Mosaic’s founder the Revd Trevor Wyatt Vicar of Christ Church Bexleyheath in the diocese of Rochester.

The new group plans to work in dioceses “to give voice to the silent majority” and currently has conveners in 23 of them. The Archdeacon of Sarum the Ven. Alan Jeans who is the convener in Salisbury diocese said: “There are many clergy and laity who have an interest or need for our campaigning group. Mosaic offers those who are marginalised or subject to discrimination a listening ear. We also aim to be a point of contact for the bishop’s staff with regards to inclusivity issues within the diocese.”

Jayne Ozanne one of eight patrons said that one of the group’s early objectives was to ensure that LGBTI+ people could engage safely in debates about Living in Love and Faith.

The other patrons are: the Dean of Guildford the Very Revd Dianna Gwilliams who chairs Inclusive Church; the Archdeacon of the Isle of Wight the Ven. Peter Leonard who chairs One Body One Faith; the Revd Bill Braviner Priest-in-Charge of St Peter’s Stockton-on-Tees and of Elton and Durham Diocesan Disability Adviser from Disability and Jesus; the Dean of Manchester the Very Revd Rogers Govender one of the C of E’s BAME clergy; the Deans of Bristol (the Very Revd Mandy Ford) and St Edmundsbury (the the Very Revd Joe Hawes) both of whom have civil partners; and the Archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham the Ven. Malcolm Chamberlain. Archdeacon Chamberlain recently helped to set up the Evangelical Forum at the General Synod.

Q & A:

CT: By what criteria were members of the coalition chosen?

Trevor Wyatt: “We chose senior leaders who represent the full breadth of inclusion issues within the Church of England and who were in full agreement with our aims. We also wanted to ensure a range of church traditions and geographical spread.”

Were there any groups who were invited and declined? Any who wished to join but were rejected? Is there a statement of faith to which an organisation must subscribe if it wishes to join?

Trevor Wyatt: “We haven’t formally invited other groups to join us. Indeed we don’t have ‘formal relationships’ per se with any other groups; however at local level within dioceses we anticipate Mosaic will work collaboratively with other groups and individuals who are championing specific inclusion issues. There were therefore no organisations who we rejected.”

Tim Goode: “There is no ‘statement of faith’ as such. However we have created a document: ‘Mosaic Journeying Together’ which expresses what Mosaic aims to do and our theological rationale. We anticipate that all our members would want to agree with these aims but we do not require them to ‘sign’ them as some groups have a tendency to do.”

Joe Hawes: “We invite all to join with us — whoever they are — who want to work to end all forms of discrimination currently operating in the Church.”

Given the open non-membership model of Christianity why is such a coalition needed?

Jayne Ozanne: “The current policies and culture of the Church of England sadly actively discriminate against various sections of society; it also has a poor track record of ensuring full participation amongst others. MOSAIC believes that the Church of England should be a Church for all England and that there should be no second-class citizens. We aim to be a grass-roots campaigning movement which will galvanise a broad coalition of support in every diocese and so lead inexorably to radical change.”

Mandy Ford: “There is no other organisation fulfilling this grass-roots campaigning role in each diocese.”

It’s often easier to understand an organisation by asking what it’s against. What are you against?

Jackie Doyle-Brett (steering-group member and convenor): “Mosaic is against all forms of discrimination and anything that forms a barrier to inclusion in the life of the Church.”

What do you say to the members of individual organisations in the coalition who don’t fit into the interlocking bit of the Venn Diagram and who disagree with some of the aims of other coalition members?

Tim Goode: “We would encourage those who disagree with some of our aims to engage with us. We would invite them to partner with us on areas where we agree and in areas where we disagree let’s disagree well and as long as no harm is being caused let us respect our different perspectives.”

How will you act jointly? Will every statement have to be signed off by multiple coalition members? What if a member demurs? Or a member organisation puts out a statement with which others disagree?

Tim Goode: “Statements from Mosaic will be agreed and signed off by the patrons. A number of patrons of Mosaic also represent other organisations/groups which enables us to ensure that our statements are aligned to their own statements.”

On the principle that every campaigning group should plan its demise what would the Church need to look like for you to say your work is done?

Jackie Doyle-Brett: “Our work will be done when change has been realised policies of the Church have changed and the Church has stopped discriminating against groups currently excluded from full participation in its life.”",,,

Courtesy Stratoscope –

NO NEED TO DIVEST: Next-generation security screening tools like the Evolv Express bring artificial intelligence to bear.

There’s been a rush of products and services aimed at addressing venue security health and safety in the age of COVID-19. The devices present challenges for venue managers that must separate the wheat of effective technology from the chaff of snake oil solutions that are untested and unlikely to perform as advertised say experts in the field.

“It’s one thing to have a technology founder or developer come and tell you ‘I’ve got this great technology. We think it’s going to work well for this industry.’ It’s another thing to have a third party really put it through its paces in an operational sense and ensure that we understand how to apply that technology to this industry” said security consultant Dan Donovan founder and managing partner of Stratoscope.

“Go see the product in action talk to other venues that have purchased and installed the equipment you’re interested in. They will tell you the good the bad and the ugly” said Larry Perkins president and CEO of Perkins Crowd Management Group and assistant general manager at PNC Arena in Raleigh North Carolina. Perkins said it’s also wise to approach new technology pitches with specific questions geared toward individual facilities. “You might have additional protocols that will be implemented at your venue that are not a part of the system in use at theirs” he said.

“Understand the licensing process. For example you just don’t plug in an X-ray machine and start operating. No. State and local environmental radiation agencies require licensing operating certifications and inspections and if you move the X-ray to another venue it has to be approved. Do you have the space to fit an X-ray machine? Is it heated and waterproof? Understand all aspects before leaping in.”

Damon Zumwalt president and CEO of Contemporary Services Corp. says vetting new technology is crucial and requires patience “to study compare products and get advice from real experts and also recommendations from those that have experience with the products or companies involved with them.” “It’s often the habit to relegate purchasing to a department which doesn’t have operational experience and solely relies on a paper proposal without fact checking” he said. “This is a dangerous proposition. The implementation of staffing and safety measures are just too important not to have greater consideration.”

Contactless screening solutions notably the Evolv Express units from Evolv Technology that were used at the College Football Playoff at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami are gaining a foothold at venues where friction- free guest experiences that boost safety and security are the order of the day says Donovan. The walk-through metal detector has greater throughput and is paired with artificial intelligence software to hone the device’s accuracy reducing false-positives to less than a third of traditional magnetometers.

Stratoscope has a deal with Evolv to lease the contactless systems to arenas and stadiums.

“We’ve got to maintain our security posture and still be able to get guests in in a touchless frictionless process and that’s where some new technologies have come to light that are really assisting a number of venues” Donovan said. “Evolv has come out with a metal detection device where the guests are not having to empty their pockets. We’re only going to see more products like that come to the marketplace.”

Another technology gaining traction is the Clear ticketing solution that uses biometrics such as fingerprint and retinal scans to identify and admit venue guests. Clear recently raised $100 million in a funding round that included 32 Equity the investment arm of the NFL.

“If you can integrate an Evolv unit with the Clear platform there’s no need to touch anyone” said Akmal Ali founder and CEO of Aluma a Washington D.C.-based risk management and security advisory firm that specializes in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Safety Act program.

The International Association of Venue Managers through its Academy for Venue Safety and Security informs attendees about properly vetted technology that works in facilities.

“What you’re basically doing is adding layers to reduce levels of severity and of the risk” said Mark Herrera IAVM’s Director of Education and Life Safety. “If technology is a part of it that’s a win.” Drones are other high-tech tools used to secure sports and entertainment venues especially on the perimeters. Stratoscope works with a company called Unified Command that deploys tethered drones among other technologies to add a layer of security at events.

One company D-Fend Solutions based in Israel with a U.S. unit in Washington D.C. has been in business since 2017. It touts its cyber radio frequency system technology to identify if an aircraft is friend or foe and can take control of the drone and safely land it.

Zumwalt says drones can be used to boost security efforts. “There are drones that cost $200 and drones that cost $20 million that can be used in a variety of ways” he said. “There is presently an effort to load a drone with a highly accurate nuclear detection and analysis system to detect clandestine materials and explosives from a large standoff distance which could enhance the safety of the perimeter of venues and parking lots” he said. “Drone science is ever-evolving and parallel to that is the science for drone detection for preventative safety measures.”

Radio communications are another key aspect of venue security and Motorola Solutions has rolled out a smart radio called the Mototrbo Ion. It’s kind of a walkie-talkie on steroids combining the assets of a smartphone including wireless accessibility with a push-to-talk two-way radio. The company completed an 18-month development at the end of 2020 and is touting the Ion as a valuable tool for use in venues a segment in which Motorola Solutions already has a presence according to company engineer Carlos Camps.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The huge rise in environmental social and governance-based investing is funnelling money into companies that pay less tax and provide fewer jobs than many counterparts with lower ESG ratings analysis shows.

Assets under management in ESG ETFs jumped three-fold from just under $59bn at the end of 2019 to $174bn at the close of 2020 according to data from TrackInsight an ETF data provider.

Yet while the ESG movement is driven by a stated desire to improve the world by tackling issues such as climate change and board composition it is arguably exacerbating other fissures in society.

“ESG funds are unconsciously worsening the social and political crisis associated with automation inequality and monopolistic concentration” said Vincent Deluard global macro strategist at StoneX a New York-based brokerage.

“I doubt that the unfolding crises of the 2020s can be averted if the ESG movement’s ultimate effect is to funnel more money into tax-avoiding tech monopolies pharmaceutical giants with few workers and financial networks” he added.

“Despite its noble goal ESG investing unintendedly spreads the greatest illnesses of post-industrial economies. As ESG ratings increasingly determine the allocation of capital we must pay attention to the kind of companies they reward.”

Deluard’s analysis found that companies with high ESG ratings pay much less tax than their lower-rated peers.

US-listed Russell 1000 companies with the top triple-A ESG rating from MSCI for example paid an average tax rate of 18.4 per cent last year while triple-C-rated firms typically paid 27.5 per cent.

“There is an almost perfect inverse relation between companies’ ESG ratings and their effective tax rate” said Deluard.

The discrepancy is likely to be partially driven by sectoral effects with ESG funds skewed towards technology companies which arbitrage differences in tax regimes between the countries in which they operate in minimise their tax liabilities via transfer pricing and have a lot of intangible assets which they can locate in the most favourable tax jurisdiction.

Microsoft for example is rated “best in class” in most ESG metrics helped by having a human rights policy a biodiversity policy and plans to be carbon negative by 2030. Yet it has paid an effective tax rate of 16 per cent over the past eight years he said compared to the 47 per cent paid by triple-C rated Universal Health Services.

“Big tech’s profits are so massive that a small increase in tax compliance would do more social good than all the remarkable initiatives touted in their glossy corporate social responsibility reports” said Deluard.

The single most salient characteristics of these funds is that they favour machines and intangible assets over humans

He argued taxation was a “blind spot” for the ESG industry as a whole with for instance only five of the 551 ESG metrics available on the Bloomberg platform sourced from MSCI related to taxes (although some other tax data are available via companies’ income statements).

Bloomberg declined to comment as did a number of other ratings providers and ESG fund managers approached for this story.

Deluard also claimed that ESG investors were “winning their unintended war against people” by shunning labour-intensive companies.

Comparing a “virtuous 15” of the stocks most overweighted versus the S&P 500 in the 15 largest US ESG equity ETFs to an “ugly 15” of the most underweighted companies he found that the former which include Apple Microsoft and PepsiCo employ just 1.9m people against 5.1m for the latter which include Walmart Philip Morris International and Boeing.

The average “virtuous” company has 20 per cent fewer employees than the median Russell 3000 company despite having a larger market capitalisation than the typical S&P 500 stock.

Last year “the best [investment] strategy would have been to do exactly what ESG ETFs unconsciously do: sell companies with lots of employees and buy ones with lots of robots patents and intellectual property” Deluard said.

He described this as “the dark secret” of ESG investing. “The single most salient characteristics of these funds is that they favour machines and intangible assets over humans.”

Moreover he argued this was a feature not a bug of ESG. “Companies with no employees do not have strikes or problems with their unions. There is no gender pay gap when production is completed by robots and algorithms.”

In order to tackle these issues Deluard proposed that ESG metrics should be adapted to incorporate how many workers a company employs relative to market cap.

Climate Capital Where climate change meets business markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here

“You should acknowledge that a job in itself has value before you even talk about what sort of job it is.”

Further he argued that ESG should be expanded to ESGT to incorporate taxation as a fourth pillar.

“How about taking the amount of tax they pay and just rewarding companies that pay a lot” he said. “Part of being a good global citizen is that you pay taxes and those taxes help to solve problems.”

However Deluard feared there would be pushback from much of the business community if this approach was adopted.

“You can get a company to try and protect the environment or have more diversity it doesn’t affect the bottom line but to make them pay more taxes . . . Right now they have a legal duty to pay as little tax as they can.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:CELH) have power over the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger smaller companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Warren Buffett said that he likes ""a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people."" So it's nice to see some insider ownership because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

With a market capitalization of US$4.4b Celsius Holdings is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. In the chart below we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Celsius Holdings.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Celsius Holdings?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

We can see that Celsius Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Celsius Holdings' historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Celsius Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Arcus Capital Partners LLC is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 9.4% of the shares outstanding respectively Charmnew Limited and CD Financial LLC are the second and third largest shareholders.

We also observed that the top 6 shareholders account for more than half of the share register with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Celsius Holdings

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Celsius Holdings Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$4.4b and insiders have US$663m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.

General Public Ownership

The general public with a 18% stake in the company will not easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 5.5% private equity firms could influence the Celsius Holdings board. Some investors might be encouraged by this since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Private Company Ownership

We can see that Private Companies own 13% of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties such as insiders have an interest in one of these private companies that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Celsius Holdings better we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Celsius Holdings is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis  you should know about...

Lakeland native displays flair for hair on Netflix show 'We Are the Champions',"As a student at Griffin Elementary in Lakeland Merlande Petithomme sometimes drew a scolding from her teacher for creating braids out of her classmates’ shoelaces.

Her mother became exasperated because Petithomme would cut the hair off one of her dolls and affix it to the head of another after changing the hair color or fashioning it into braids.

“At one point my mother she got tired” Petithomme recalled. “She said ‘Listen I’m not going to keep buying these dolls for you to keep cutting the hair.’ So she went to the hair store and bought me hair extensions so I could braid it into my dolls’ hair.”

Some three decades later Petithomme is still drawing attention for her experiments with hair. The heads she now adorns belong to humans not dolls and the reaction she provokes is dazzled admiration.

The Lakeland native is featured in an episode of the Netflix documentary series “We Are the Champions” which began streaming in November. The show presents such lesser-known competitions as cheese rolling in rural England yo-yoing and frog jumping.

The third episode introduces fantasy hairstyling a competitive realm Petithomme entered more than a decade ago. The show documents her winning performance in 2019 at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show billed as the nation’s premiere multicultural hair and makeup event.

As the category name suggests Petithomme and other stylists created looks not intended for a day at work or a trip to the grocery store. Her winning design fitting the Mardi Gras theme for the New Orleans gathering set a towering fleur-de-lis symbol atop the head of a model in a jewel-encrusted gown with feathered wings.

“I felt all of that tied into who I am and what I’m bringing into the competition” said Petithomme 38. “So I always let them know whenever I came to a competition I’m going to have the baddest model and whatever I do will stand out from the rest.”

Petithomme who now lives in a suburb of Atlanta and operates a salon there said she was born to be a hairstylist. She suggested that her obsession with hair might derive from a childhood trauma.

At age 6 she developed three tumors in her head that caused hair loss before they were removed she said.

“I think that was the turning point in my life really getting me deeper into hair” she said. “You go to the hair store and there’s never that wig that fits you and looks good. I probably like in middle school started constructing my own hair pieces and that’s how I got into creating custom hair-loss pieces.”

That is one of the specialties of her business Platinum Salon by Merlande.

Early aptitude

By middle school Petithomme had also started styling other girls’ hair at her family’s home on West 14th Street. Her father created a makeshift salon for her in the garage and her mother collected the money friends would pay for Merlande’s services.

Petithomme’s parents immigrated from Haiti and like many immigrants placed heavy emphasis on education. They said she could continue the hair activities only if she remained on the honor roll.

By the time she graduated from Kathleen High School in 2001 Petithomme said she wanted to make a career of hairstyling. She attended Traviss Technical College in Lakeland but her parents insisted that she pursue an academic degree.

Petithomme said she received a scholarship to Florida State University and began there before returning home to be with her ailing mother. Petithomme then enrolled at Florida A&M University the historically black school in Tallahassee.

Though she had resisted college she said the culture at FAMU allowed her to flourish in her sideline of hair work. She became the preferred stylist for many fellow students and some professors she said sculpting hair in such designs as micro braids box braids corn rows flat twists locs ponytails sculpture updos doobie wraps sew-ins waterfalls ridges and quick-weave bond-ins.

Petithomme made coiffure statements of her own often wearing 30-inch extensions in blond or jet black.

While at home she maintained such steady business at her parents’ house that someone complained to state authorities. Petithomme had not yet gained her cosmetology license and she paid a fine with the promise of getting her license.

After earning a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice Petithomme added a master’s in public administration from Liberty University. Rather than pursuing a career in her academic field though she vaulted into the realm of hair.

During her college days Petithomme often devised elaborate hair displays for friends before homecoming weekend or other major events. A fellow student was so impressed that she urged her to enter a competition at the annual Bronner Bros. show.

Petithomme entered her first contest in 2010 but became discouraged after failing to win. She renewed her commitment following the death in 2013 of her grandfather who had prodded her to keep trying. Petithomme said she also drew encouragement from Dwight Eubanks who had appeared as a sidekick on the reality show “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.”

Eubanks gave Petithomme a pep talk after a competition in which he served as a judge.

“He pulled me to the side and said ‘You have what it takes’ ” she said. “ ‘You just need to read the rules and figure out how to bend the rules without breaking the rules.’ ”

Dromedary drama

Petithomme said she started having more success winning titles in various categories including hair for fitness weaves and braids. She competed not just at the Bronner Bros. gathering but at Professional Beauty Association events in California.

In 2017 she was invited to take part in the “hair battle” at the Bronner Bros. show in Atlanta. That format challenges stylists to create three looks onstage in 15 minutes while also delivering patter to an audience of 5000. Her parents and grandmother and many friends attended the event.

Having learned that contests thrive on spectacle of all sorts Petithomme decided to make a memorable entrance.

“I came in on a camel and everyone went crazy” she said. “The crowd went crazy. Even though I did not win the hair battle it was life-changing for me. It shifted my career as a competing hairstylist.”

Two years later Petithomme earned a spot in the fantasy hair showdown at the Bronner Bros. show in New Orleans. The event had a Mardi Gras theme and Petithomme said she also drew upon her Haitian heritage in devising a hairstyle for Careena Heidel a towering model from Tallahassee.

Petithomme gave the model’s short hair a gold tint in advance. During the 90-minute showdown she crafted a nearly 2-foot-tall version of a fleur-de-lis — a stylized lily and the symbol of French-inflected New Orleans — that she attached atop Heidel’s head.

Stylists are barred from using wigs in competitions but they can deploy other embellishments. Petithomme prefabricated the centerpiece of the fleur-de-lis winding some synthetic hair around a hard foam mold. She said the final design was 90% hair.

Petithomme said the fleur-de-lis symbol fit her sensibility.

“I told them whenever I compete I’m going to be the one to bring the trouble which I felt also played into the fleur-de-lis” she said. “It’s a good sign for justice but at the same time back then with slavery whenever the slaves would run they would brand them with the fleur-de-lis which indicated to the slave owner that that particular slave was trouble.”

Kizzy Peg Laguerre a Winter Haven native now living in Atlanta applied makeup to complement Petithomme’s design and Heidel’s dress.

“Her costume had a lot of rhinestones in it and the theme was just a Caribbean carnival and Mardi Gras-esque type of theme” said Lagurre a graduate of Winter Haven High School and Polk State College. “I wanted not to just do typical beauty makeup because the model was already beautiful. So I said ‘If I can put some of those rhinestones that are on her costume a little bit on her face to kind of take the look to the next level let’s do it’ and when I told Merlande that she said ‘Let’s do it. I love that idea.’ ”

Lagurre 36 likened the effect to having a tiara on the model’s forehead.

Brash presence

The Netflix show introduces Petithomme by showing her dancing in a sparkly purple dress an elaborate gold headpiece with feathers atop her head as a traditional New Orleans second line band plays around her. Petithomme’s confident and saucy personality shines through in her interview segments.

“I’ve never been an underdog but coming in new territory they don’t know who you are so they label you the underdog” she says sitting on a couch and wearing a fuschia top with puffy shoulder wings. “I always tell people ‘I was born a star.’ I am a star. The world just don’t know about it yet.”

The episode culminates with Petithomme being named the winner and standing exultantly beside Heidel. As the champion she received a $2000 prize and hair products but the main reward was worldwide exposure. She said her wig orders have doubled since the program started streaming.

“The reaction has been amazing from all angles” she said. “The first week it placed in the top 10 (on Netflix) so that was huge. People have been reaching out to me from every angle globally — about hair loss me representing my culture of Haitian-Americans and then we get the competing side. I’ve had people reach out from Brazil the UK Europe all over the world.”

Laguerre who appears briefly in the show said she drew inspiration not just from that episode but from all six segments of the series. She said she went online after watching to learn more about cheese rolling and frog jumping contests.

“The whole documentary of all the different competitions it was an awesome eye opener just to give everybody a glimpse of those people’s worlds and what they take serious” she said. “I know everybody who won or did it it really gave them a platform to really showcase their skills and show that hey nothing is really taboo anymore nothing is out of the ordinary and if you have talent show it display it and be proud of it. That’s what I took from the show — to be proud of your skills. One person may not look at it as a skill but if you do then that’s exactly what it is.”

Though the COVID-19 pandemic has temporarily halted hairstyling competitions Petithomme is eager to show that her victory in New Orleans — and her subsequent flash of fame — were not flukes.

“Just because there’s a pandemic doesn’t mean I’ve stopped making and creating” she said. “I’m still creating on the back end so when the opportunity comes I’m ready.”

It blocked Australians from sharing any news links Australian news publications from hosting their content on the platform and the rest of us from sharing links to Australian news sites. It also may be a preview of how the platform will respond to the almost-certain future attempts to regulate its business — not just in Australia but all over the world.

Now that we’ve had a few days to see how it’s played out it seems like the general consensus from media experts is that no one is a winner here but Facebook at least has a point. Many experts also just don’t like the proposed Australian law that inspired Facebook’s move. So while Facebook was right to balk at the law the way it went about registering its objection was too abrupt clumsy and potentially harmful.

By also demonstrating the sizable role the platform plays in keeping users informed Facebook is taking what could be a huge gamble. On one hand it could prompt the Australian government to come up with a law that Facebook prefers so that it’ll reverse the news block — the outcome Facebook almost certainly prefers other than there being no new law at all. But the situation could just as easily prove just how much market power Facebook has. This in turn might make the case for regulations to check Facebook’s power that much stronger.

The News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code — which is currently making its way through the Australian parliament and will likely pass before its session ends on February 25 — will require Facebook and Google to negotiate payment agreements with news organizations if they allow users to share news content on their respective platforms. If they don’t an arbiter will figure out a payment agreement for them. Google and Facebook initially threatened to pull their services from the country if the law were to pass but as that passage looked more and more likely their responses were very different. Google started making deals with publications. Facebook “with a heavy heart” cut the country off at the knees by banning news outlets altogether.

Australians suddenly found themselves unable to share news links on their timelines and publications found their pages essentially wiped of content. There was a global impact as well: Australians couldn’t share international news links as international news publications were blocked in the country just like the native ones.

The ban didn’t just affect the news however. While Facebook told Recode that it intended to take “a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted” the company appears to have been overzealous in its banning. Facebook blocked a lot of pages and links that weren’t news including charities bike trails Facebook itself and government agencies including health sites as the country prepares to begin its Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Either Facebook’s block was hasty and careless or it was spiteful — or it was a combination of both. In any case it wasn’t a good look.

“Facebook managed to turn attention away from a flawed piece of legislation and on to its own reckless opaque power” wrote Emily Bell director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. “Even for a company that specializes in public relations disasters this was quite an achievement.”

Techdirt founder and media analyst Mike Masnick on the other hand thought Facebook was perfectly within its rights to do what it did. He even argued that the news ban is in the best interests of a “free and open internet” as the Australian law will force Google and Facebook to pay a “link tax” that he feels is “inherently problematic.”

“A bunch of lazy newspaper execs who failed to adapt and to figure out better internet business models not only want the traffic they also want to get paid for it” Masnick wrote. “This is like saying that not only should NBC have to run an advertisement for Techdirt but it should have to pay me for it. If that seems totally nonsensical that’s because it is. The link tax makes no sense.”

Many of those who criticize the new Australian law point out that Rupert Murdoch whose News Corp dominates Australian media likely stands to gain the most from it. After all when enacted the law would require Google and Facebook to pay Murdoch who used his considerable influence on the Australian government to push for legislation like this for years. Case in point: News Corp has already made a multi-year multi-million-dollar deal with Google (Facebook’s ban was announced and implemented just hours after the Google-News Corp deal was announced). Australia’s other media giants Seven West Media and Nine Entertainment also worked out big deals with Google. But it remains to be seen how the law — or the threat of it — would benefit smaller publishers that don’t have the same resources or power to negotiate deals with one of the biggest companies in the world.

Among those who have a problem with the law itself many agree with the motivation behind it: Google and Facebook have benefited from the news industry. The platforms get traffic from users who are reading and sharing the news but more importantly they dominate the digital ad industry. Because most news outlets rely heavily on digital ads for revenue they’re almost forced to agree to Facebook’s and Google’s terms and prices. So the tech giants get a nice cut from those ads while news publications have effectively lost their business model.

That dominance — and the media’s decline — is why the law was the recommendation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) which has been looking into Google and Facebook for years. Commissioner Rod Sims has said that he believes the two have too much market power and the law is needed for media companies to have a chance at a fair deal for a cut of the profits those platforms have made off of their content.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison strongly urged Facebook to reconsider and “friend us again” saying that the block was “not a good move” and may well have ramifications for the company beyond Australia’s borders. Canada France and the European Union are believed to be considering similar laws and the United States is pursuing antitrust actions against Facebook Google and other Big Tech companies both on state and federal levels.

“There is a lot of world interest in what Australia is doing” Morrison told the Associated Press. “That’s why I invite as we did with Google Facebook to constructively engage because they know that what Australia will do here is likely to be followed by many other Western jurisdictions.”

Morrison added: “It’s not okay to unfriend Australia because Australia is very friendly.”

But some of Australia’s 13 million Facebook users were not feeling very friendly in the aftermath of the block. A number of them told Recode that they saw Facebook’s move as an abuse of power and feared they would now miss out on important news or emergencies or that the news vacuum caused by the block would be filled with more misinformation. But one Recode reader had a different view: He hoped people would seek the news out on their own rather than only reading whatever headlines were shared by friends.

“I would be much more comfortable if all Aussies got their news direct from the source” he said. “I think this would be best for quality journalism and the strength of our democracy.”

It looks like some Australians are trying to do just that: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s app was the most downloaded app in Australia’s App Store in the days following the ban.

Some commentators pounced on Facebook’s actions as proof of its monopolistic intent and lack of concern for civic discourse. Others blame the Australian government for bowing to the protectionist interests of media cronies such as Rupert Murdoch and putting tech companies in an absurd position.

What else can be done to push billions of dollars back into journalism?

Australia’s approach is now being considered by lawmakers and regulators in multiple other governments. Reuters reports that Canadian heritage minister Steven Guilbeault said Canada will model its own legislation on the Australian law. There are also some similarities in a bill proposed by US congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island that would “provide a temporary safe harbor for the publishers of online content to collectively negotiate with dominant online platforms regarding the terms on which their content may be distributed.”

In general these measures seek to boost the bargaining power of news organizations and help them extract value from tech giants for the content that newsrooms produce. The Australian model’s novelty lies in its arbitration mechanism a kind of membrane between the parties intended to help them arrive at a fair exchange of value.

The Australian law will likely pass so this grand experiment in pushing capital back to the news media will soon be under way. We’ll get to see how it works out and whether opponents’ concerns bear out—if larger news organizations are privileged over small ones for instance or whether the money actually ends up being spent on producing more journalism.

But in view of the objections to this approach what other options exist? If new subscription models are not enough to sustain the media industry what else can be done to push billions of dollars back into journalism?

A raft of ideas can be found in the archives of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which studied this problem extensively in the early 2000s. The commission’s 2010 paper “Potential Policy Recommendations to Support the Reinvention of Journalism” found “reasons for concern that experimentation may not produce a robust and sustainable business model for commercial journalism.” So the authors went on to look for other pots of gold.

One idea put forward in the report was antitrust exemptions to “allow news organizations to agree jointly on a mechanism to require news aggregators and others to pay for the use of online content” which sounds a lot like the Australian law.

But others are more novel such as:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9kZXplZW4tZmFjZWJvb2stcGFnZS1ibG9ja2VkLWF1c3RyYWxpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dezeen among news sites blocked by Facebook in Australia,"Dezeen's Facebook page has been blocked in Australia by the social media giant as part of its ongoing dispute with the country's government over a proposed law that would require it to pay news outlets for content.

Dezeen is one of numerous media companies that have had their pages blocked by Facebook in Australia since Thursday when the company banned the viewing and sharing of content from news outlets on its site in the country.

People in Australia that visit Dezeen's page now see a notice saying ""No posts yet"".

Facebook made the move in response to a proposed law that would force the social media company to pay news outlets for content.

Facebook block ""highly frustrating""

""Apologies to Dezeen followers in Australia"" wrote Dezeen editor-in-chief Marcus Fairs on his Facebook page. ""Meanwhile please enjoy Dezeen on other platforms especially our website and newsletters!""

""It's highly frustrating!"" wrote Melbourne-based fashion journalist Natalie Mortimer in response.

Sydney-based design journalist Sophie Davies said the move was ""pretty shocking and feels anti-democratic"". However content from her website DesignFizz was unaffected.

""It's a shock seeing the ability to share and discuss them on such a major platform cut completely at a stroke"" she wrote."" At least DesignFizz is still accessible but we're a lifestyle not a news channel!""

However designer Michael Young said: ""I am so happy Facebook has done this. Australia is more a communist state than China.""

Facebook's ban on news content follows draft legislation published by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which if introduced would require the social media company and search engine Google to pay for the content.

The proposed law has been opposed by both companies.

However while Google recently signed a contract to pay for news from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Facebook made the decision to ban news on its site.

""Facebook does not steal news content""

In a statement announcing the news ban Facebook said that the proposed law misunderstands the current relationship between publishers and social media companies as it believes that news companies benefit from using its platform.

""What the proposed law introduced in Australia fails to recognize is the fundamental nature of the relationship between our platform and publishers"" said Campbell Brown vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook.

""Contrary to what some have suggested Facebook does not steal news content"" he continued.

""Publishers choose to share their stories on Facebook. From finding new readers to getting new subscribers and driving revenue news organizations wouldn’t use Facebook if it didn’t help their bottom lines.""

According to Facebook news only makes up four per cent of content in people's feed while it generated referrals to publishers in Australia that it values at AU$407 million.

Ban ""arrogant"" and ""disappointing""

The ban on news content has been widely criticised in the country.

""Facebook's actions to unfriend Australia today cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services were as arrogant as they were disappointing"" said Australian prime minister Scott Morrison in a statement on his Facebook page.

""These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them"" he continued. ""They may be changing the world but that doesn’t mean they run it.""

In the UK the chairman of the government's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee also criticised the move.

""I think it's staggeringly irresponsible – at a time when we are facing a plethora of fake news and disinformation in relation to the Covid vaccine"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzLzU2MTI3MTU40gEnaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvNTYxMjcxNTguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook in Australia: What happened after news was blocked?,"Allow Twitter content?

Birch Narrows Dene Nation officials say they took action after workers with Baselode Energy Corp. started surveying the band's traditional territory without consent.

""It was very disrespectful totally uncalled for"" Birch Narrows Chief Jonathon Sylvester said. ""This is not being done properly.""

It's unclear how the stalemate will be broken but the case raises a host of legal environmental and economic issues.

One academic said Canada's Constitution and emerging case law is clear: First Nations concerns must be front and centre on any development affecting them.

""Certain behaviours or ways of doing business that might have worked in the past no longer work based on a more robust understanding of how treaty rights and aboriginal rights need to be reconciled"" lawyer and University of Saskatchewan lecturer Benjamin Ralston said.

'They can't do this stuff to us'

Birch Narrows trapper and elder Ron Desjardin discovered the survey crew earlier this month on one of the community's trap lines 600 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.

The area sits on the edge of the Athabasca Basin. It's home to some of the world's richest uranium deposits but also to endangered woodland caribou lynx and other wildlife.

Desjardin called Sylvester to see whether he had given permission for the crew to begin its work. Sylvester had not.

Desjardin says a proper wildlife and habitat study must be conducted before any talks can begin on uranium exploration in their traditional territory. (Jason Warick/CBC)

A few days later the Baselode Energy workers were again seen at the site. Desjardin told them they shouldn't be there particularly since the area was in lockdown because of a COVID-19 outbreak.

""Man that really was infuriating because it was just so disrespectful. Just total disregard"" Desjardin said. ""We're not back in the 1800s anymore. They can't do this stuff to us.""

A teepee blockade was set up across the road and Birch Narrows leaders issued a cease-and-desist order against the company.

Desjardin and Sylvester said it's even more frustrating because it seemed the company was initially acting in good faith. The previous week both sides had a meeting and agreed to talk more before any work began.

Baselode offered to build a cell tower for the community but Desjardin said he told them it wasn't a high priority.

Birch Narrows wanted a detailed wildlife and habitat impact study conducted before things went any further. Desjardin said the endangered woodland caribou are his biggest concern.

""Also as a trap line area we carry out extensive activity: trapping hunting fishing. We've done it for generations. It's been passed down to us for a long long time"" he said.

""We have people who have passed away on those trap lines who have given up their lives on those trap lines in their struggle to feed their families. That area means a lot to us. It's not just an ordinary piece of land. It has a lot of significance to us as a community.""

Company says it obtained all provincial permits

Stephen Stewart the chair of Baselode's board said in an interview that the company obtained all necessary provincial permits. He said the initial survey would have next to no environmental impact.

Stewart said the company started work because it has to be done when the ground is frozen but he acknowledged that waiting a week until after the second meeting with the First Nation wouldn't have mattered.

Stewart also said he meant no disrespect.

""I will note that we are permitted to do this work but permit and the consent of the community are different things"" he said.

""In any project that is in the extractive business you absolutely need to have these local communities as partners. Not to be cliché but it is a win-win for everybody.""

Stewart said he and his officials will work closely with Birch Narrows. He's now promising the project will not proceed unless the First Nation agrees.

""There can be no project without the buy-in from the communities"" he said.

Stewart said in an email that the CEO of Baseload ""maintains personal/professional relationships with chiefs band members and community members."" CBC News asked to speak with one of them but Stewart declined.

Traditional land-use study not required province says

Neither Saskatchewan Environment Minister Warren Kaeding nor Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre was made available for an interview.

A provincial official emailed a response.

The official said Birch Narrows was given ample time to voice any concerns. Like Stewart they said this is an exploration phase and there will be no drilling or digging.

The province takes the position that a traditional land-use study is not required by law. In the statement the official said that ""deliberately blocking Crown lands is illegal"" and could be referred to the RCMP.

University of Saskatchewan lecturer and lawyer Benjamin Ralston says the old ways of doing business no longer work for companies or provincial and federal governments when it comes to projects affecting Indigenous people. Canada's Constitution as well as recent court rulings have affirmed inherent and treaty rights he says. (Submitted by Benjamin Ralston)

But law instructor Ralston of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon said the Constitution and recent Supreme Court of Canada rulings make it clear that there is a ""duty to consult and accommodate"" Indigenous rights holders.

Those inherent and treaty rights override any provincial permit process he said. That's why provincial governments and resource companies are better off working in good faith with First Nations than risking a time-consuming expensive court battle they may not win he said.

""At the end of the day Aboriginal and treaty rights are constitutionally entrenched. So if the process by which those permits were issued is in breach of the Crown's obligations then a court could invalidate those"" Ralston said.

The blockade is no longer up but Birch Narrows members are patrolling the area regularly.

Trapper and elder Desjardin said they're still willing to talk but only if the government and Baselode treat the First Nation's members with respect.

""We were caught off guard and we don't want that to happen again. We don't want people just moving in without a proper consultation process"" Desjardin said.

""We need to be able to have a dialogue. Let's sit down."""
NWS,News Corp,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIwMjEvMi8yMC8yMjI5MTQyNS9mYWNlYm9vay1hdXN0cmFsaWEtbXVyZG9jaC1sYXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook’s Australian news ban might do the wrong thing for the right reasons,"Facebook’s sudden move on Wednesday to cut Australians off from the news (and the rest of the world from Australian news) was as surprising as it was draconian. It blocked Australians from sharing any news links Australian news publications from hosting their content on the platform and the rest of us from sharing links to Australian news sites. It also may be a preview of how the platform will respond to the almost-certain future attempts to regulate its business — not just in Australia but all over the world.

Now that we’ve had a few days to see how it’s played out it seems like the general consensus from media experts is that no one is a winner here but Facebook at least has a point. Many experts also just don’t like the proposed Australian law that inspired Facebook’s move. So while Facebook was right to balk at the law the way it went about registering its objection was too abrupt clumsy and potentially harmful.

By also demonstrating the sizable role the platform plays in keeping users informed Facebook is taking what could be a huge gamble. On one hand it could prompt the Australian government to come up with a law that Facebook prefers so that it’ll reverse the news block — the outcome Facebook almost certainly prefers other than there being no new law at all. But the situation could just as easily prove just how much market power Facebook has. This in turn might make the case for regulations to check Facebook’s power that much stronger.

The News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code — which is currently making its way through the Australian parliament and will likely pass before its session ends on February 25 — will require Facebook and Google to negotiate payment agreements with news organizations if they allow users to share news content on their respective platforms. If they don’t an arbiter will figure out a payment agreement for them. Google and Facebook initially threatened to pull their services from the country if the law were to pass but as that passage looked more and more likely their responses were very different. Google started making deals with publications. Facebook “with a heavy heart” cut the country off at the knees by banning news outlets altogether.

Australians suddenly found themselves unable to share news links on their timelines and publications found their pages essentially wiped of content. There was a global impact as well: Australians couldn’t share international news links as international news publications were blocked in the country just like the native ones.

The ban didn’t just affect the news however. While Facebook told Recode that it intended to take “a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted” the company appears to have been overzealous in its banning. Facebook blocked a lot of pages and links that weren’t news including charities bike trails Facebook itself and government agencies including health sites as the country prepares to begin its Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Either Facebook’s block was hasty and careless or it was spiteful — or it was a combination of both. In any case it wasn’t a good look.

“Facebook managed to turn attention away from a flawed piece of legislation and on to its own reckless opaque power” wrote Emily Bell director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. “Even for a company that specializes in public relations disasters this was quite an achievement.”

Techdirt founder and media analyst Mike Masnick on the other hand thought Facebook was perfectly within its rights to do what it did. He even argued that the news ban is in the best interests of a “free and open internet” as the Australian law will force Google and Facebook to pay a “link tax” that he feels is “inherently problematic.”

“A bunch of lazy newspaper execs who failed to adapt and to figure out better internet business models not only want the traffic they also want to get paid for it” Masnick wrote. “This is like saying that not only should NBC have to run an advertisement for Techdirt but it should have to pay me for it. If that seems totally nonsensical that’s because it is. The link tax makes no sense.”

Many of those who criticize the new Australian law point out that Rupert Murdoch whose News Corp dominates Australian media likely stands to gain the most from it. After all when enacted the law would require Google and Facebook to pay Murdoch who used his considerable influence on the Australian government to push for legislation like this for years. Case in point: News Corp has already made a multi-year multi-million-dollar deal with Google (Facebook’s ban was announced and implemented just hours after the Google-News Corp deal was announced). Australia’s other media giants Seven West Media and Nine Entertainment also worked out big deals with Google. But it remains to be seen how the law — or the threat of it — would benefit smaller publishers that don’t have the same resources or power to negotiate deals with one of the biggest companies in the world.

Among those who have a problem with the law itself many agree with the motivation behind it: Google and Facebook have benefited from the news industry. The platforms get traffic from users who are reading and sharing the news but more importantly they dominate the digital ad industry. Because most news outlets rely heavily on digital ads for revenue they’re almost forced to agree to Facebook’s and Google’s terms and prices. So the tech giants get a nice cut from those ads while news publications have effectively lost their business model.

That dominance — and the media’s decline — is why the law was the recommendation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) which has been looking into Google and Facebook for years. Commissioner Rod Sims has said that he believes the two have too much market power and the law is needed for media companies to have a chance at a fair deal for a cut of the profits those platforms have made off of their content.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison strongly urged Facebook to reconsider and “friend us again” saying that the block was “not a good move” and may well have ramifications for the company beyond Australia’s borders. Canada France and the European Union are believed to be considering similar laws and the United States is pursuing antitrust actions against Facebook Google and other Big Tech companies both on state and federal levels.

“There is a lot of world interest in what Australia is doing” Morrison told the Associated Press. “That’s why I invite as we did with Google Facebook to constructively engage because they know that what Australia will do here is likely to be followed by many other Western jurisdictions.”

Morrison added: “It’s not okay to unfriend Australia because Australia is very friendly.”

But some of Australia’s 13 million Facebook users were not feeling very friendly in the aftermath of the block. A number of them told Recode that they saw Facebook’s move as an abuse of power and feared they would now miss out on important news or emergencies or that the news vacuum caused by the block would be filled with more misinformation. But one Recode reader had a different view: He hoped people would seek the news out on their own rather than only reading whatever headlines were shared by friends.

“I would be much more comfortable if all Aussies got their news direct from the source” he said. “I think this would be best for quality journalism and the strength of our democracy.”

It looks like some Australians are trying to do just that: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s app was the most downloaded app in Australia’s App Store in the days following the ban.

We’ll see how things progress. And if you live in Australia you’ll have to go directly to your favorite news website for updates.

Some commentators pounced on Facebook’s actions as proof of its monopolistic intent and lack of concern for civic discourse. Others blame the Australian government for bowing to the protectionist interests of media cronies such as Rupert Murdoch and putting tech companies in an absurd position.

What else can be done to push billions of dollars back into journalism?

Australia’s approach is now being considered by lawmakers and regulators in multiple other governments. Reuters reports that Canadian heritage minister Steven Guilbeault said Canada will model its own legislation on the Australian law. There are also some similarities in a bill proposed by US congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island that would “provide a temporary safe harbor for the publishers of online content to collectively negotiate with dominant online platforms regarding the terms on which their content may be distributed.”

In general these measures seek to boost the bargaining power of news organizations and help them extract value from tech giants for the content that newsrooms produce. The Australian model’s novelty lies in its arbitration mechanism a kind of membrane between the parties intended to help them arrive at a fair exchange of value.

The Australian law will likely pass so this grand experiment in pushing capital back to the news media will soon be under way. We’ll get to see how it works out and whether opponents’ concerns bear out—if larger news organizations are privileged over small ones for instance or whether the money actually ends up being spent on producing more journalism.

But in view of the objections to this approach what other options exist? If new subscription models are not enough to sustain the media industry what else can be done to push billions of dollars back into journalism?

A raft of ideas can be found in the archives of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which studied this problem extensively in the early 2000s. The commission’s 2010 paper “Potential Policy Recommendations to Support the Reinvention of Journalism” found “reasons for concern that experimentation may not produce a robust and sustainable business model for commercial journalism.” So the authors went on to look for other pots of gold.

One idea put forward in the report was antitrust exemptions to “allow news organizations to agree jointly on a mechanism to require news aggregators and others to pay for the use of online content” which sounds a lot like the Australian law.

But others are more novel such as:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9kZXplZW4tZmFjZWJvb2stcGFnZS1ibG9ja2VkLWF1c3RyYWxpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dezeen among news sites blocked by Facebook in Australia,"Dezeen's Facebook page has been blocked in Australia by the social media giant as part of its ongoing dispute with the country's government over a proposed law that would require it to pay news outlets for content.

Dezeen is one of numerous media companies that have had their pages blocked by Facebook in Australia since Thursday when the company banned the viewing and sharing of content from news outlets on its site in the country.

People in Australia that visit Dezeen's page now see a notice saying ""No posts yet"".

Facebook made the move in response to a proposed law that would force the social media company to pay news outlets for content.

Facebook block ""highly frustrating""

""Apologies to Dezeen followers in Australia"" wrote Dezeen editor-in-chief Marcus Fairs on his Facebook page. ""Meanwhile please enjoy Dezeen on other platforms especially our website and newsletters!""

""It's highly frustrating!"" wrote Melbourne-based fashion journalist Natalie Mortimer in response.

Sydney-based design journalist Sophie Davies said the move was ""pretty shocking and feels anti-democratic"". However content from her website DesignFizz was unaffected.

""It's a shock seeing the ability to share and discuss them on such a major platform cut completely at a stroke"" she wrote."" At least DesignFizz is still accessible but we're a lifestyle not a news channel!""

However designer Michael Young said: ""I am so happy Facebook has done this. Australia is more a communist state than China.""

Facebook's ban on news content follows draft legislation published by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which if introduced would require the social media company and search engine Google to pay for the content.

The proposed law has been opposed by both companies.

However while Google recently signed a contract to pay for news from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Facebook made the decision to ban news on its site.

""Facebook does not steal news content""

In a statement announcing the news ban Facebook said that the proposed law misunderstands the current relationship between publishers and social media companies as it believes that news companies benefit from using its platform.

""What the proposed law introduced in Australia fails to recognize is the fundamental nature of the relationship between our platform and publishers"" said Campbell Brown vice president of global news partnerships at Facebook.

""Contrary to what some have suggested Facebook does not steal news content"" he continued.

""Publishers choose to share their stories on Facebook. From finding new readers to getting new subscribers and driving revenue news organizations wouldn’t use Facebook if it didn’t help their bottom lines.""

According to Facebook news only makes up four per cent of content in people's feed while it generated referrals to publishers in Australia that it values at AU$407 million.

Ban ""arrogant"" and ""disappointing""

The ban on news content has been widely criticised in the country.

""Facebook's actions to unfriend Australia today cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services were as arrogant as they were disappointing"" said Australian prime minister Scott Morrison in a statement on his Facebook page.

""These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them"" he continued. ""They may be changing the world but that doesn’t mean they run it.""

In the UK the chairman of the government's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee also criticised the move.

Birch Narrows Dene Nation officials say they took action after workers with Baselode Energy Corp. started surveying the band's traditional territory without consent.

""It was very disrespectful totally uncalled for"" Birch Narrows Chief Jonathon Sylvester said. ""This is not being done properly.""

It's unclear how the stalemate will be broken but the case raises a host of legal environmental and economic issues.

One academic said Canada's Constitution and emerging case law is clear: First Nations concerns must be front and centre on any development affecting them.

""Certain behaviours or ways of doing business that might have worked in the past no longer work based on a more robust understanding of how treaty rights and aboriginal rights need to be reconciled"" lawyer and University of Saskatchewan lecturer Benjamin Ralston said.

'They can't do this stuff to us'

Birch Narrows trapper and elder Ron Desjardin discovered the survey crew earlier this month on one of the community's trap lines 600 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.

The area sits on the edge of the Athabasca Basin. It's home to some of the world's richest uranium deposits but also to endangered woodland caribou lynx and other wildlife.

Desjardin called Sylvester to see whether he had given permission for the crew to begin its work. Sylvester had not.

Desjardin says a proper wildlife and habitat study must be conducted before any talks can begin on uranium exploration in their traditional territory. (Jason Warick/CBC)

A few days later the Baselode Energy workers were again seen at the site. Desjardin told them they shouldn't be there particularly since the area was in lockdown because of a COVID-19 outbreak.

""Man that really was infuriating because it was just so disrespectful. Just total disregard"" Desjardin said. ""We're not back in the 1800s anymore. They can't do this stuff to us.""

Now Nike Sportswear is set to keep the ball rolling with a boisterous Dunk Low “Flip The Old School” a wild style that’s a modified modern-day tribute to the Dunk High “City Attack” pack from 1999.

The right shoe offers a straightforward mixture of white and purple with its main detail provided by ostrich leather overlays. The left shoe however almost completely inverses the look of its counterpart. White and purple tones swap places with Swooshes turned upside down to drive the inspiration home even further. Besides these flipped Swooshes the branding on the tongue and heel tab has been reversed as well. A semblance of similarity is provided by the return of the aforementioned ostrich leather on the overlays plus matching white and purple midsoles/outsoles.

Just like the recent Air Force 1 “Keep ‘Em Fresh” the “Flip the Old School” also comes covered in tissue paper a shell that here features original illustrations of a Dunk-wearing crew plus “Flip the Old School” printed on the lateral heel. Though this finite paper may be removed before wear if the wearer choses its graphic also appears in a much more permanent fashion on the insoles.

An official release date and pricing information for the Nike Dunk Low “Flip the Old School” has yet to be revealed. However it may arrive alongside the aforementioned Air Force 1 “Keep ‘Em Fresh” sometime this spring.

By Ryan Yousefi

In 2012 Matthew Walzer was a 16-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas who had already defied the odds and conquered many of the challenges that come with living with cerebral palsy. From walking with minimal assistance to learning how to speak without a lisp he was an example of what someone could do by overcoming obstacles in their path.

As he prepared for college he wondered if his favorite shoe company Nike would help him overcome one more tedious hurdle: tying his own shoes. Walzer wrote a letter to the footwear giant asking one single question; “Can you help?”

What started with the letter that Walzer described as a “Hail Mary” attempt to get Nike’s attention has become the inspiration for their Go FlyEase shoe offering a completely hands-free way to put on shoes making it easier for people with disabilities.

The FlyEase is the first shoe that features no laces to tie no velcro to strap and no zippers necessary to secure. Step inside and the shoe wraps around the foot.

“My dream was for Nike to create a basketball shoe that had a closure system that could be used by everybody” Walzer said. “To see Nike come through with it is fantastic and it’s going to benefit so many people.”

From 2012 to 2015 Walzer collaborated with Nike on what was the original FlyEase prototypes. Nike would send him over a pair of their latest incarnations of the shoe and he would relay his feedback on how the rear-entry design could be tinkered. At first the best Nike had to offer were a pair of their Hyperdunk line of shoes that featured a zipper up the middle and a Velcro strap. That alone changed the game for Walzer but the best was yet to come.

In 2015 Nike CEO Mark Parker who put one of the company’s top sneaker designers on the case invited Walzer then 19-years-old to the Nike headquarters in Beaverton Oregon where he was presented the first pair of the Zoom Soldier 8 Flyease shoes by then Cleveland Cavaliers’ superstar LeBron James’ himself.

In 2021 the footwear giant more than answered his call in assisting him on his quest for a hands-free basketball shoe. In fact Nike has taken the alley-oop that was his dilemma and solved it with a slam dunk.

Walzer now a 25-year-old graduate of Florida Gulf Coast University says the FlyEase is the culmination of a shoe he could only dream existed when he was a teenager.

Now a post-college graduate and advocate for people living with physical disabilities Walzer reflects on how far his letter has gone and all the lives it will impact as FlyEase expands beyond basketball shoes and into every style Nike has to offer.

“I always thought my vision wasn’t just the shoe wasn’t just for myself” Walzer said. “Yes my letter had to do with my going away to college without having to worry about tying my own shoes but also there are millions of other people with disabilities that struggle with the same thing. I felt a responsibility to bring this to Nike’s attention.”

While Walzer is ecstatic over how far his partnership with Nike has come and how many lives the FlyEase will soon change he’s clear that footwear is just the beginning of his quest to make everyone’s shared environment takes into account what people with various disabilities may need.

“People with disabilities have always had to adapt to our environment around us” Walzer said. “I really think it’s time for the world to adapt to us and take into consideration our needs and how the world can help us.”

Find out more about how we review and recommend products.

The original Nike Infinity Run was a great shoe. It paired a big chunk of comfortable React cushioning with a rocker in the midsole to make cruising through training runs feel that little bit easier.

There was only one real problem – the upper. Some runners found it didn’t provide enough structure to lock down the foot especially around the midfoot and heel. So with the Infinity Run 2 Nike has done the sensible thing and focused on updating that upper leaving the rest of the shoe much the same.

While I didn’t have any problems with the upper on the Infinity Run 1 I still prefer the design of the new shoe. There is more padding around the heel and Flywire cables around the midfoot to hold the foot in place comfortably and securely. There’s also a lot of padding on the tongue which is now more separated from the upper compared with the bootie design of the original Infinity. I’ve heard tell of people accidentally ripping this tongue clean off and it doesn’t seem very securely attached to the rest of the upper but so far mine is intact.

The Infinity is not billed as a traditional stability shoe but it does have some stability features such as the large plastic clip running around the back half of the shoe and the very wide forefoot base. I’m a neutral runner but didn’t really notice the clip on the run and I consider extra stability to be mostly welcome in shoes with high stacks of foam that you’d expect to use for long easy runs.

Underfoot there is a generous slab of Nike’s React cushioning. As a foam it’s an all-rounder – not hugely squishy or bouncy but not hugely firm either. It offers a pretty “dead” ride in truth which is not necessarily a bad thing – your legs are protected from the road and it’s comfortable but you’re not getting the serious amount of bounce you get from the Nike Invincible or Asics Novablast.

The stand-out feature of the ride is the smoothness: the rocker moves you through your foot strike with an extra degree of ease so you just keep on rolling without any harshness. It’s a great ride for logging easy and steady training runs in and does it differently to a bouncy easy-day shoe.

I was also pretty impressed with how it felt during an interval workout running 24 60-second rounds with 30 seconds of recovery. It’s not a lightning-fast shoe by any means but it’s better for speedwork than similar shoes like the Saucony Endorphin Shift in my experience. I’d still rotate the Infinity Run 2 with a faster shoe if you take your training seriously though; or if you want just one shoe for all your training opt for an all-rounder like the Saucony Endorphin Speed.

The Nike Infinity 1 was a shoe renowned for its durability and I racked up several hundred kilometres in it without any signs of wear and tear. Given the lack of changes to the Infinity 2’s midsole and outsole I expect it to offer similar levels of durability which makes the price of £139.95 easier to swallow.

I found that the outsole gripped well in the snowy and wet winter we’ve been having – not surprisingly as the Infinity 1 performed similarly well in these conditions.The fit of the Infinity seems true to size to me as was the original although the second version of the shoe is a little more snug.

The Infinity Run 2 is a shoe built with a purpose in mind – to offer support and protection on your easy training runs – and it succeeds in that aim. But that doesn’t mean it’s completely lacking in versatility: you could use it for faster running though it doesn’t excel on this front.

Whether it’s the shoe for you will mostly come down to what kind of ride you prefer. It’s a smooth but pretty dull ride especially compared with bouncier – dare I say more fun – shoes like the Novablast or Nike’s new Invincible. There are also more comfortable shoes like the Brooks Glycerin if that’s all you want from your easy-day trainer.

The Infinity Run 2 is another solid option in this bracket and it’s good to see Nike address the main flaw of the original with the updated upper. It’s expensive but the durability of the React foam used will soften that blow in the long term.

Buy men’s from Nike | Buy women’s from Nike | £139.95",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbG9zaW5nLXNua3JzLWFwcC1hY3R1YWxseS1iYWQtMTQwMDI2OTUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Losing Out on the SNKRS App Actually a Bad Thing? It's Definitely Not for Nike,"When the Air Jordan 3 “Cool Grey” lands today on the SNKRS app collectors who are unable to buy a pair will inevitably turn to Twitter with their frustrations. In recent months the complaints have grown louder and more frequent.

Some have grown tired of the experience altogether.

More from Footwear News

“I always explore other options first. SNKRS is a last-ditch effort but I go into it knowing I have about the same odds as the [New York] Knicks have of winning a title” said Mitch Jacobs a former social media content coordinator at StockX who now performs a similar role at Twitch.

And Jacobs is not alone in having apprehension about the app.

“When I start thinking about copping a specific Nike sneaker I do not always think SNKRS app first. I always check out the stores that will get the sneaker” explained Damaries Negron a noteworthy collector who goes by the name @KickItWitDD on Instagram. “I have a better chance on a in store raffle than on SNKRS app. If I do not win a store raffle then the SNKRS app is my final resource.”

However not everyone has sworn off the app. While he admitted to missing out on an estimated 98% of all SNKRS launches — with a losing streak of 11 months and 14 days — sneaker influencer and content creator Henry Francois said he hasn’t given up all hope just yet.

“As frustrating as it is to take L after L on that app it doesn’t dissuade me from attempting because it literally doesn’t cost me anything but a few moments of heartache” Francois said.

Despite the mounting angst Matt Powell senior sports industry adviser for The NPD Group Inc. would argue the experience is not much different than what Nike has done successfully for a long time.

“The model has always been one of scarcity. Whether you had to line up on a Saturday morning — or even Friday night — to wait outside of a store to get a shoe Saturday morning or if you had to punch in as quick as you can to get on the app the concepts are really the same. This has really worked for the brand for decades” Powell explained.

And Marc Beckman founder and CEO of advertising agency DMA United believes the discussion — whether it’s about voicing frustrations or celebrating wins — actually plays into Nike’s favor.

“This formula of supply and demand has been working to establish a jewel in the crown position of some of Nike’s products. The issue isn’t about customer satisfaction but rather a marketing perception tactic to enhance consumer demand” Beckman said. “Nike’s sneakers become more coveted by its fanbase when some drops are simply unattainable. It’s just an old marketer’s trick fueled by new technology.”

Because the scarcity model has proven to be a financial success for the company Powell believes there isn’t much incentive for Nike to change how it delivers limited releases for any of its banners.

“It’s important to remember that Jordan alone is a $3 billion business and it was built on scarcity. It’s not like they have a little cottage industry here that they’re trying to preserve. This is a massive business” Powell said. “It’s bigger than most brands that are in the athletic space.”

He continued “Yes you could argue they could be doing more but they’re doing a lot of business — and it’s very profitable. To sell out of a shoe in minutes this is a highly profitable product.”

What’s more given the level of product offered the SNKRS app is the only place to shop for some.

“There are fewer places today to buy these shoes at the manufacturer’s suggested price” Powell said. “If you say ‘I’m going to get this shoe and flip it’ or ‘I absolutely have to have the shoe’ you don’t have a lot of choices to go elsewhere. Do you sit out for a couple of rounds [on SNKRS] because you missed out and you’re angry? Maybe. But I don’t I don’t think it permanently drives customers away.”

Although Jacobs now lives in a major city with several boutiques he recognizes this isn’t the case for most.

“I’m in L.A. so I always start with the local spots which are thankfully aplenty. Kith Undefeated Bodega and DSM are my first choices” Jacobs said. “Growing up in South Bend Ind. my only option was Niketown Chicago for big releases — about a two-hour drive. I would hate to be in that situation now.”

SNKRS also offers a convenience factor that most of today’s collectors find appealing regardless of the outcome.

“I’d much rather take an L from the comfort of my own home rather than lining up and taking an L especially in the midsts of a pandemic” Francois said. Also I’m sure Nike is aware of how myself and sneakerheads my age and up feel about having to deal with these draws. They’re also aware of the fact most of us will keep trying so that’s why nothing has changed despite the complaints over the years.”

Although missing out on SNKRS has caused frustration actually landing a pair on the app has added to the excitement of the purchase.

“Picture [Michael] Jordan hitting ‘The Shot’ over Craig Ehlo. Seriously I’ve almost thrown my shoulder out fist pumping and celebrating some of these few and far between wins” Francois said.

Negron experienced a similar feeling specifically with a coveted Off-White collab.

“When they did the exclusive access for women’s-exclusive Off-White 4’s I logged in a minute late and was still able to cop. I jumped and screamed because something like this never happens” Negron said. “I wish I can have that same moment again. When I won that sneaker I felt for once that finally they noticed I exist and I really want that sneaker. I wear that sneaker with pride.”

The app might be polarizing but Powell believes Nike could evolve SNKRS to quell most user frustrations.

“Instead of letting it be a free for all where people come on at 10 a.m. on a certain date to get a shoe maybe do it by invitation. Go to loyal customers who haven’t won and send an email saying ‘You have one hour here’s a special code you can get your shoe’ and give your best customers the opportunity to get product” Powell said. “I absolutely could see logically and functionally how that could happen and now you make the customer even more loyal and create a whole different paradigm that isn’t this frantic scramble.”

Police and the National Trust have urged motorists and the public to stay away from the Divis Road area of Belfast today due to “huge amounts of traffic” and “dangerous roadside parking”.

The PSNI say officers responded to a report of traffic congestion and parked cars causing obstructions within the vicinity of Divis Mountain and Divis Road Belfast on Sunday morning.

Last month the Trust appealed for the public to exercise close to home as hundreds took to the Black Mountain.

Earlier today National Trust NI tweeted: “We’re already experiencing huge amounts of traffic on Divis Mountain this morning resulting in dangerous roadside parking which the PSNI are managing. The car parks are now full so please do not travel here today.”

Twenty-seven months to the end of Buhari’s second and final term caucusing machinations scheming and realignments have commenced among politicians especially those in the two leading political parties in the country.

The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the leading opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are yet to zone their presidential tickets to any part of the country but scheming for it has commenced thus the crisis rocking the two political parties.

Expectations are that the zoning arrangement of the two parties would be known after their national conventions later this year.

Impeccable sources told one of our correspondents that the APC 2023 zoning formula would be made known and ratified at the party’s national convention likely to hold in June this year.

Similarly competent sources at the PDP national secretariat said the direction of the party as per the 2023 presidency would be known in December this year when the national convention of the party is likely to hold.

Before the political parties take decisions on the zoning politicians are pushing for the consideration of their respective regions.

However some northern politicians have aligned themselves with the agitation that the South should produce the next president of the country.

Since 1999 when the country returned to civil rule the presidency has been rotated between the southern and northern parts of the country.

Unconstitutional as it is the arrangement has played a key role in determining who emerges as the president of the country.

So far four persons including the incumbent President Buhari (North-West) have governed the country.

The rest are Chief Olusegun Obasanjo (South-West) the late Umaru Musa Yar’adua (North-West) and Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (South-South).

The agitation for the zoning of the presidency ballooned in July last year when Buhari’s nephew Mallam Mamman Daura said there was no need for it positing that competence should be given priority in 2023.

Mixed reactions trailed Daura’s position forcing the presidency to distance President Buhari from it insisting it was his nephew’s personal opinion.

However if anything the ‘clarification’ by the presidency only emboldened some notable northern politicians to speak on the matter.

Governor Nasiru El-Rufai

Without mincing words Kaduna State governor Malam Nasiru Ahmad El-Rufai has backed the quest for southern presidency come 2023.

El-Rufai 61 who is completing his second term in 2023 had on many occasions made his position on the 2023 presidency clear insisting that it was the turn of the South to man the coveted seat in the country.

In an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC El-Rufai said “In Nigerian politics there is a system of rotation in which everyone agrees that if the North rules for eight years the South will rule for eight years.

“That is why I came out and said that after President Buhari has been in office for eight years no northerner should run for the office. Let the southerners also have eight years.”

However sources around the governor and in the APC said he was scheming to pair with a southern politician to contest for the vice-presidential seat.

Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje

El-Rufai and the Kano State governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje are most of the times not on the same page on issues but on zoning they share the same position.

Days ago while featuring on Channels Television’s Politics Today Ganduje said the presidential slot should be given to the southern region.

“It should go to the southern part of the country but there should be a consensus of members.

“The zoning system even though it is not in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a strategy for winning elections” he said.

Ganduje who is completing his second term in May 2023 has a very cordial relationship with the national leader of the APC Asiwaju Bola Tinubu who is said to be eyeing the presidency.

His closeness to Tinubu fuels the reports that he may pair with him in 2023.

Governor Babagana Zulum

In the spirit of fairness the Borno State governor Professor Babagana Zulum said power should go to the South in 2023.

At the 17th Chief Gani Fawehinmi Annual Lecture with the theme: “The constitutional history of Nigeria’s dysfunction: Any pathway to indivisibility and common progress?” the governor said the country was moving into an inevitable tension.

“My response to the question posed by the theme of this programme is that yes there are pathways to indivisibility and common progress.

“We must collectively agree that we need to do more to demonstrate fairness to every constituent part that made up this country. That is the constitution.

“We need to understand that pedestrian suspicion is not an empirical or legal reason to deny any section of the country participating in the leadership of this country.

“We are fast moving towards a point of inevitable tension” Zulum a first-term governor said.

Abdulaziz Yari

Also throwing his weight behind a southern presidency is a former governor of Zamfara State Abdulaziz Yari.

He said if the presidential ticket went to the South the APC chairmanship would go to the North.

“Our presidency has to go to the South. The APC chairmanship may as well come to the North” Yari a former chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) said.

Senator Ali Ndume

A former Senate Leader Mohammed Ali Ndume (APC Borno South) has said it will be tantamount to a third term if the APC fields a northerner as its presidential candidate come 2023.

Ndume who chairs the Senate Committee on Army in an interview with Daily Trust on Sunday said in the spirit of fairness justice and fair play the party should zone its presidential ticket to the South.

He added that retaining the presidency in the North would not augur well for the party and the country.

“As a founding member of the APC I witnessed the first convention where the presidency was deliberately zoned to the North and four candidates from the region – President Muhammadu Buhari former Vice President Atiku Abubakar Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and the late Sam Nda-Isaiah – slugged it out with Rochas Okorocha exercising his constitutional rights.

“I feel it would not be fair equitable and just to field a northern candidate for the presidency in the APC. To me fielding a northern candidate would be tantamount to a third term which is unconstitutional” he said.

He said the fairest thing was to allow southerners slug it out among themselves for the 2023 presidential ticket of the APC.

Senator Ahmad Babba Kaita

Kaita represents Katsina North Senatorial District where President Muhammadu Buhari hails from.

To him the APC would be doomed if its zoning arrangement is jettisoned in 2023.

The lawmaker said although he was not aware of any agreement in the party common sense demands that the South should produce Buhari’s successor.

He said “Considering the political arithmetic of this country it is common sense that none of us can produce a president without the support of the other.

“It is common sense that we have to network with other people and bring like-minds to be able to wrest power in favour of our party.

“If this is the case we should rotate and accommodate everybody. I believe that even though it is not written it is a gentlemanly agreement we should be able to abide by because without the contribution of other stakeholders from other regions the APC is doomed.

“That was what happened to the PDP. They were so power-drunk that they thought everything was possible.

“I am a firm believer that the only way we can survive as a party is to make sure that power rotates within the regions” he said.

What Nigerians should look out for – Prof Jega

Lending his voice to the debate a former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Professor Attahiru Jega said Nigerians should go for the best.

Jega a chieftain of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) said “My take is that in a country state or local government people should look for the best.

“Things have been so bad for long in Nigeria. We have been reduced to perceive representation in the context of where someone comes from rather than competence experience and capacity of that person to govern.

“All over the country they are doing that. We want our own to be there; and our own goes there and didn’t do what we wanted still everybody wants their own to be there.

“I believe strongly that to manage ethnic and religious challenges in our country the issue of federal character is important at least for some time before we get to a point where people will realise that putting the focus on competence and merit is the best way for a country to develop.

“But I can summarise my point that ultimately for Nigeria to develop tap and explore its potentials we have to pay attention to merit competence and capacity while at the same time looking at the issue of federal character.

“Let everybody produce their best and let us all look for the best everywhere and decide amongst them who is the best.

“It is possible to do that using a scientific criterion to produce the best” he said in a recent interview.

Failure of leaders makes zoning inevitable – Don

For Dr David Omeiza Moveh a senior lecturer in the Department of Political Science and International Studies Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria zoning is still seen as a stabilising factor in Nigeria’s democracy because of the failure of successive administrations to accommodate and give a sense of belonging to different parts and people of the country.

He said the Nigerian elite needed to continue to use the formula for peace to reign in the country.

He added: “I think the issue of zoning has become a factor in our political reality. If you look at the nature of the Nigerian society it is heterogeneous comprising competing interests across regions ethnicity and even religions. Therefore it has become very crucial or almost inevitable to try to balance these competing interests if we want peace to reign in the country. I think this is why zoning has come to be with us.”

The varsity don said it was a product of informal arrangement amongst the political elite for the presidency to rotate between North and South.

“If a region holds the presidency for eight years then it is logical for another region to hold it for the next eight years. By now zoning is not supposed to be an issue in our democracy but there is the failure of leaders to deliver services that will affect citizens’ lives.

“If leaders effectively accommodate all the diverse interests across the length and breadth of this country whichever part of the country they come from would not be an issue. This failure makes zoning to become like an entitlement – if one zone holds it the other may feel it is its turn. In a mature democracy zoning is not an issue” he said.

On whether the failure of leadership since the return of democracy is the factor that makes zoning still relevant in Nigeria’s democracy Dr Moveh said it may be a factor but not the real issue.

He added “I think the major issue in Nigeria is accommodation – giving every part of the country a sense of belonging. If we talk of the failure of leadership it entails many issues. If you look at the military leaders that were in place before President Obasanjo was installed they were from the northern part of the country. This coupled with the 1993 annulment of the June 12 presidential election which was widely believed to have been won by the late MKO Abiola made the political elite to agree that power should shift to the South and South-West for that matter. That was why the two major contestants then Olu Falae and Obasanjo emerged.

“So zoning is like a gentleman’s agreement amongst the elite to see how they can accommodate and give a sense of belonging to all the parts of the country.”

Moveh does not believe that zoning is a way of sacrificing or compromising competence based on parochial interests.

There are qualified Nigerians in every region

He said “The truth is that there are qualified Nigerians in every region. If we want to move further to the six geopolitical zones qualified Nigerians are everywhere. The question is how to find them. We should have a leadership recruitment process. One of the ways of finding them is to look at the records and antecedents of Nigerians that held one position or another and how they performed.

“For instance the Federal Executive Council is supposed to comprise one minister at least from every state. So from 1999 we know those that have been ministers governors senators among others. We can find those that delivered. However it may not be democratic to find leaders but every state can come together to pick one person who should compete with others from the remaining 35 states.”

Dr Moveh believes that the only way Nigeria can do away with zoning is for leaders to rise to their responsibilities. In his view most Nigerians would not bother who a leader is and from which zone if they are feeling the impact of his leadership in their lives.

“If you look at the 1993 elections the presidential contestants were Muslims. Again if you also look at 1999 elections the two major contestants were from a particular region of the country. So the issue of religion region or ethnicity in my opinion usually comes to play when the leadership fails to effectively carter for Nigerians and accommodate people of divergent interests. Once leadership is working this issue of zoning will be a thing of the past” he added.

The Northern Elders’ Forum (NEF) has commiserated with the families of a critic and politician Dr Junaid Mohammed and the former Comptroller-General of Nigerian Customs Service Abdullahi Dikko who died hours apart on Thursday.

A statement by the Director Publicity and Advocacy of the forum Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed described the late Mohammed as a key player in the nation’s political fortunes.

While also describing the former NCS CG as a humble generous and a patriot the forum expressed sadness that the duo passed away only a few weeks after the demise of Alhaji Usman Faruk.

The statement read “Northern Elders Forum is saddened by the loss of two more of its founding members Dr Junaidu Muhammed and Alhaji Abdullahi Dikkon Inde only a few weeks after the demise of Alhaji Usman Faruk.

“Dr Junaidu Mohammed was an outstanding medical doctor who carved an irreplaceable path as a politician who combined principled activism with ideological politics.

“He had been a key player in the nation’s political fortunes and was always involved in nurturing the democratic process. He had served in the House of Representatives in the Second Republic.

“His outstanding intellect was always available to the North and Nigeria and he died at a moment when he was deeply involved in the search for a new of life for our country. Alhaji Abdullahi Dikko Inde was a distinguished public servant who rose to be the Comptroller-General of Nigerian Customs Service. His humility and generosity to his community. He was a model patriot.

“The Forum joins the nation and their families in praying for Allah’s mercies on them and His bountiful rewards for their services to their communities and the nation.”"

The rocket's two Russian-built RD-181 first stage engines ignited at 12:36 p.m. throttled up to full thrust and pushed the booster skyward from pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport - MARS - at NASA's Wallops Island Virginia flight facility.

Climbing directly into the plane of the space station's orbit the Antares 230+ rocket streaked away on a southeasterly trajectory to kick off the company's 15th space station cargo run.

The climb out of the lower atmosphere went smoothly and after a two-minute 45-second firing of the rocket's solid-propellant second stage the Cygnus cargo ship was released to fly on its own on course to catch up with the station early Monday.

Along with research materials spare parts and other equipment the spacecraft also will bring fresh food to the station's crew members.

""Some of the things that we're sending up will include perishable items like parmesan and cheddar cheese apples and tomatoes nuts and dried meats and even a little bit of candy"" said David Brady space station associate program scientist.

Also on board: maple smoked sockeye salmon ""for those crew members that love fish.""

""We like to keep them happy because (it) helps them be more productive and allows us to do more science"" Brady quipped.

The primary goal of the Cygnus mission is to deliver science equipment and supplies for on-going research utilizing the microgravity environment aboard the space station.

One experiment will use small worms to learn more about how astronauts' muscles lose strength in the absence of gravity while another explores better ways to make retinal implants that could help people with degenerative vision disorders retain or improve their eyesight.

An advanced computer capable of faster processing and data compression will be tested and equipment to upgrade the station's urine recycling system will be installed. Also on board: new radiation detectors that will be used on future missions to the moon and beyond.

A few minutes before launch the International Space Station flew directly over NASA's Wallops Island Virginia launch facility where the Antares rocket and Cygnus cargo ship were awaiting liftoff. The launch site is on the coast of Virginia's Eastern Shore just to the left of the lab's robot arm (visible at the right of this image). Soichi Noguchi/NASA

""ISS research is in full bloom right now"" said program scientist Heidi Parris. ""There are hundreds of different experiments going on simultaneously on the International Space Station and it's putting into motion the work of some of the most brilliant scientific minds in the world.""

The research she said is ""attempting to make our daily lives better on Earth and also to continue to expand our abilities for future space exploration.""

If all goes well the Cygnus spacecraft will reach the station early Monday. Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi and crewmate Mike Hopkins will capture the cargo ship using the lab's robot arm. Flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston then will take over by remote control to pull the ship in for berthing.

""This vehicle is carrying over 8000 pounds of cargo to the International Space Station"" said Joel Montalbano manager of the station program in Houston. ""We've been talking to the crew onboard (and) they're eagerly awaiting the Cygnus arrival and look forward to opening the hatch and getting inside and continuing the science and research program we have scheduled.""

Northrop Grumman names its Cygnus cargo ships after notable men and women who played critical roles in America's space program. For Saturday's flight the spacecraft was named in honor of Katherine Johnson the late mathematician whose role in the early years of the space program played a central role in the movie ""Hidden Figures.""

""It's our tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who's played a pivotal role in human spaceflight"" said Frank DeMauro Northrop Grumman vice president and general manager.

Perched atop a two-stage Antares rocket the uncrewed Cygnus NG-15 spacecraft blasted off from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility here at 12:36 p.m. EDT (1736 GMT).

The craft is hauling more than 8200 lbs. (3719 kilograms) of cargo that include scientific equipment fresh food and supplies for the seven astronauts on board the space station. It's also packed with new hardware and spacewalk equipment.

The 139-foot-tall (42.5-meter) Antares rocket lifted off right on time at the beginning of a planned 5-minute window. It's Cygnus NG-15 cargo ship is named after Katherine Johnson  the trailblazing NASA mathematician who helped make John Glenn's historic orbital flight — the first by an American astronaut — possible.

Shortly after the payload fairing jettisoned leaving the Cygnus exposed to space. Powered by a solid-fueled upper stage the Cygnus was deposited in its preliminary orbit and ready to begin its journey to the space station. The cargo craft will spend two days chasing down the orbital outpost before berthing to the station with the help of a robotic arm.

Astronaut Soichi Noguchi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency will capture the vessel on Monday (Feb. 22) at about 4:40 a.m. EST (0940 GMT) with NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins serving as backup. The craft will remain at the station for approximately three months after which it will detach itself and burn up upon reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.

Hidden figures

Northrop Grumman makes both the Antares rocket and the Cygnus spacecraft. The company has a tradition of naming its spacecraft after fallen heroes who have made a significant contribution to human spaceflight.

In this case the company is choosing to honor the late Katherine Johnson who died at the age of 101 nearly a year ago on Feb. 24 2020. Johnson worked as a human computer whose trajectory calculations were critical to NASA's early success with human spaceflight in particular Glenn's orbital flight.

“It’s our tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who’s played a pivotal role in human spaceflight and Mrs. Johnson was selected for her hand-written calculations that helped launch the first Americans into space as well as her accomplishments in breaking glass ceiling after glass ceiling as a Black woman” said Frank DeMauro vice president and general manager for tactical space at Northrop Grumman said on Friday (Feb. 19).

Years after her retirement Johnson's work was highlighted in the book "" Hidden Figures "" and later the movie of the same name starring Taraji P. Hensen as Johnson. Johnson received a congressional medal of freedom and the congressional gold medal from President Barack Obama for her work at NASA.

Special delivery

Tucked inside the Cygnus is a bevy of time-sensitive cargo items including a supply of fresh food for the astronauts on the space station. During a prelaunch briefing on Friday NASA officials said they were sending up some treats for the crew members of Expedition 64 including salmon hard salami parmesan cheese caramel hard candies and other perishable items.

""We want to keep the crew happy because a happy crew is a productive crew for science"" David Brady associate program scientist for the International Space Station said prior to launch.

Also inside the Cygnus is a brine processor assembly for the space station's water recycling system which converts urine into fresh drinking water . NASA says the new processor will enable more water to be recovered from urine than with the current equipment on station. The agency says this is a key piece of hardware to help meet the requirements for future long-duration missions to the moon and eventually Mars.

""Long-duration crewed exploration missions require about 98% water recovery and there is currently no state-of- the-art technology in brine processing that can help achieve this goal"" NASA officials wrote in a fact sheet . ""This brine processor system plans to close this gap for the urine waste stream of the space station.""

The equipment works by using special membranes to separate contaminants from the brine allowing water vapor to flow into the cabin atmosphere where a condenser will capture it and filter it into the station's water system.

Also onboard the Cygnus will be a new sleeping pod for the Expedition 64 crew. Currently there are five astronauts in the U.S. segment — four Crew-1 astronauts who launched in November on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon and Kate Rubins who flew on a Soyuz last October — with only four sleep stations. Hopkins the Crew Dragon commander has been sleeping in the capsule since launching in November. Three Russian cosmonauts round out the station's crew.

Cygnus also is ferrying spare parts and equipment for the space station's toilets and equipment for upcoming spacewalks.

Weird science

The bevy of research experiments brought up on the NG-15 mission will researchers to better understand how microgravity affects the human body as well as manufacturing processes. One investigation will look at the construction of protein-based artificial retinas on station.

Designed by LambdaVision the experiment will use a layer-by-layer process to manufacture artificial retinas in space. The hope is that the ""retina"" can then be implanted into the eye of a patient suffering from degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration.

One high-tech experiment aboard is the Spaceborne Computer-2  a collaboration by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Microsoft to bring cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology to the International Space Station. Microsoft will link its Azure Space Platform to the computer to ""deliver edge computing and [artificial intelligence] capabilities'' to the station according to HPE.

Another experiment will measure muscle strength in multiple generations of worms to better understand the biological changes that happen during spaceflight. Led by Siva Vanapalli the experiment will look at how the muscle strength in worms changes overtime during spaceflight.

About 1000 worm larvae are en route to the space station tucked inside the Cygnus as part of the Micro-16 investigation. Once on station the worms will produce many offspring during their trip allowing researchers to look at multiple generations. They're also sending a device called NemaFlex which is designed to measure how much force the worms exert.

Vanapalli is hoping that the device will enable the team to measure changes in the worm's strength which can be beneficial to drug development as well as help researchers improve astronaut health.

Also on board the Cygnus are several student experiments including the Magnitude.io experiment that will help engage students in STEM projects with the help of bitmoji stickers. The experiment called ExoLab 8  is Magnitude.io's eighth investigation sent to the space station.

Mission participants (which will include students from Kindergarten through college level) will attempt to grow red clover plants at home and in their classrooms to act as a ground control experiment and compare growth rates to similar plants grown in space.

Online activities will be led by an Astro_moji teacher — Linwood Elementary Technology teacher Lisa Turney. Her likeness will be turned into a bitmoji who will teach students from space via her bitmoji avatar. The experiment will rely on a SpaceTango CubeLab that will facilitate plant growth.

""We are taking distance learning to a whole new level: 250 miles above the Earth to an orbital classroom"" Magnitude.io CEO Ted Tagami wrote in a news release . ""While the pandemic disrupted many learning experiences our mission participants will remember 2021 as the year they went to space.""

Katherine Johnson arrives at the ISS - NASASpaceFlight.com,"Northrop Grumman kicked off their 2021 launch manifest with the flight of an Antares rocket delivering the Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island Virginia at 12:36:50 EST (17:36:50 UTC) Saturday 20 February 2021.

The spacecraft then conducted a rendezvous with the Station two days later where it was berthed to the Unity module using Canadarm2. This uncrewed resupply mission delivers 3700 kg to the ISS consisting of CubeSats science experiments Station equipment and crew supplies.

The NG-15 mission

Production for this particular flight began a little more than two years ago with the start of long-lead material purchases and integrated components needed for the Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft.

While overall production and integration of an Antares/Cygnus mission can take place on a shorter time span Kurt Eberly Director Space Launch Programs Northrop Grumman related that the additional time is built-in not just for production delays but also to accommodate the potential of NASA requesting an advancement to a launch date which has happened before.

“We want to make sure that we’re there and ready to launch when NASA needs us. We want to put a little margin on things. We don’t want there to just be a bar on a schedule. We know that sometimes NASA wants to pull us forward a little bit so we try to be ready a little bit early so we can offer that and be there for when NASA needs us.”

After integration with the Cygnus spacecraft and initial cargo load operations in the horizontal integration facility for this mission were complete the entire Antares 230+ vehicle and payload were rolled to the launchpad on 16 February where the entire rocket was taken vertical for pad checkouts and Wallops Range communications checks.

Late-load cargo operations for time-sensitive science experiments as well as crew supplies took place on Friday 19 February via a pop top feature in the Antares payload fairing that allows access to Cygnus’ forward hatch.

Once late-load was completed Cygnus’ hatch was closed for flight and the payload fairing pop top was reinstalled before the rocket was taken vertical for final launch operations.

The five hour countdown began at 07:36 EST (12:36 UTC) ahead of the opening of a 5-minute launch window at 12:36 EST (17:36 UTC).

Temperatures are predicted to be in the low-to-mid 30s Fahrenheit (0 – 2.7 ℃) within Antares’ operational range that allows for temperatures as cold as 20℉ (-6.6 ℃) at liftoff.

After leaving the pad Antares pitched and rolled onto a southeasterly trajectory to begin its chase of the International Space Station.

Following first stage shutdown and separation the payload fairings deployed while the guidance system converged on a flight solution to place Cygnus into the correct orbit while also performing a series of energy scrub maneuvers to bleed off excess energy from the solid propellant upper stage (a detailed overview of how that process works can be found here).

That Castor 30XL stage then finished the orbit insertion delivering Cygnus into the Station’s orbital corridor for a two day rendezvous ahead of grapple and berthing on Monday 22 February.

After arriving in orbit Cygnus’ large batteries do not mandate the immediate deployment of its solar panels a process that will unfold over the first 90 minutes of flight.

The spacecraft’s hydrazine thrusters provide attitude control to keep it facing the Sun for power generation while reorienting the craft as needed for larger burns of the bi-propellant main engine to change the vehicle’s orbit as it approaches the Station.

After being installed onto Node-1/Unity Cygnus can also serve not just as a cargo vehicle but as an additional scientific module for the Station to accommodate additional experiments or overflow during heavy science periods.

Frank DeMauro Sector Vice President and General Manager Tactical Space Systems at Northrop Grumman said “That service is available. We did a demonstration on one of the earlier missions and since then NASA has taken advantage of that capability where they actually have crewmembers in Cygnus running science experiments in our module.”

Mr. DeMauro wasn’t sure if that element would be utilized on this flight but he stressed it is available to NASA on all Cygnus missions and the agency does not have to request the capability prior to liftoff.

“The capability is there” related Mr. DeMauro. “So if NASA decides to move an experiment into Cygnus they can plug it into ports in the cargo module and use it as another test lab.”

Science onboard

As part of the mission’s scientific objectives Cygnus is carrying numerous CubeSats and ThinSats that will be deployed after the vehicle completes its approximate two month mission at the Space Station.

All of the current satellites to be deployed from Cygnus after it departs the Station are launching aboard the craft as well though NASA and SlingShot could potentially add additional CubeSats as the months progress.

In regard to the ThinSats Kurt Eberly said “We launched some of those previously. And these are little STEM satellites and this is in cooperation with our spaceport Virginia Space. And the idea here is to take advantage of extra performance on the vehicle when it occurs and carry along these student-built and designed satellites.”

“We’re really excited about this and it’s a shame that with the pandemic we can’t have the kids out here for the launch. When we did this before we had a bunch of the high school students out here with some of their teachers and it was just awesome to see how excited they got to think about how something they designed was going to be in space.”

While the students will not be able to attend the launch data collected by their ThinSats will be made available to them in their classrooms.

Additionally a wide variety of scientific research is flying onboard NG-15 including worms a Protein-Based Artificial Retina Manufacturing system experiments to map astronauts’ dreams a powerful computer system an upgrade to the Environmental Control and Life Support System for the Station and a protein grower.

The Micro-16 experiment will aim to better understand the cause of muscle weakening experienced in astronauts in microgravity even after working more than two hours every day to prevent bone and muscle loss caused during long-duration missions.

The experiment will measure the muscle strength of C. Elegans worms to test whether decreased expression of muscle proteins is associated with decreased strengths. “Results from this study could provide insights into mechanisms causing muscle strength decline in the elderly since physiological changes occurring in spaceflight mimic accelerated aging” said Dr. Siva Vanapalli Professor of Chemical Engineering at Texas Tech University.

“These results may support new therapies to combat the effects of age-related muscle loss on Earth and can help us further understand how humans cope in the absence of gravity as we plan to go beyond Earth on longer duration crewed missions.”

Building on their previous experiment sent to ISS in 2018 LambdaVision’s Protein-Based Artificial Retina Manufacturing project will evaluate a manufacturing system to test the effectiveness of microgravity for production of light-activated protein retinas that might be able to replace the function of damaged eye tissue and can assist those on Earth suffering from retinal degenerative diseases.

Meanwhile the European Space Agency’s Dreams experiment will examine why astronauts have often reported getting a better night’s sleep during their stays aboard the Station than on Earth. The crew members will use themselves as test subjects donning a sleep monitoring headband.

Additionally the Real-Time Protein Crystal Growth 2 experiment will produce high-quality protein crystals that will undergo detailed analysis back on Earth after returning on a future SpaceX Cargo Dragon 2 spacecraft. Astronauts will check the crystals report their growth and then make changes based on initial observations.

Microgravity produces high-quality protein crystals that can be analyzed to identify possible targets for drugs in the treatment of diseases; however it is difficult to analyze protein structures on Earth because gravity interferes with the optimal growth of protein crystals.

Aside from the bio-medical experiments onboard Cygnus the craft is also carrying a new high-performance computer called Spaceborne Computer-2. This experiment will test off-the-shelf systems that can process data faster in space by employing artificial intelligence capabilities as well as in-situ data processing on Station eliminating the need to send the data to Earth for analysis.

Additionally the Station’s Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) will receive an upgrade in the form of Exploration ECLSS: Brine Processor System.

This device will increase water recovery and recycling efficiency on the Station from the current 93% level to 98%.

Current systems on the Station recover 93% of water and water vapor but Exploration ECLSS: Brine Processor System will increase that by recovering additional water from the Urine Processor Assembly.

This upgrade feeds directly into longer-duration future spaceflights which will be required to achieve 98% water recovery.

Honoring Katherine Johnson

It is Northrop Grumman’s tradition to name each Cygnus vehicle after someone who has had a pivotal role in human spaceflight. This flight is named in honor of NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson an instrumental figure in ensuring the safety of early U.S. human spaceflight missions from Freedom 7 onward to Apollo 11.

Johnson received undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and French from West Virginia State at just 18 years old. She then began graduate studies at West Virginia University the first black woman to attend graduate school there.

In 1953 she joined the all-black West Area Computing group at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Langley laboratory. In 1957 Johnson joined NACA’s Space Task Group which later became NASA.

During her time in the Space Task Group Johnson performed the trajectory analysis for Alan Shepard’s Freedom 7 mission in May 1961 the United States’ first human spaceflight. Johnson also co-authored a paper on orbital spaceflight and landing becoming the first woman to receive credit as an author of a research paper at NASA.

Johnson is most well-known for her work behind John Glenn’s orbital mission which launched exactly 59 years ago today (20 February 1962).

Glenn specifically requested that Johnson run the computer’s calculations by hand to proofread its work saying “If she says they’re good then I’m ready to go.”

Johnson went on to contribute valuable calculations for the Apollo 11 lunar landing and authored or co-authored 26 papers during her time at NASA.

In 2015 at age 97 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama the highest honor for a U.S. citizen.

Johnson passed away on 24 February 2020 at the age of 101.

Speaking to the decision to name this mission in honor of Johnson Kurt Eberly said “In rocketry in spaceflight we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. And when our students learn orbital mechanics and how to calculate trajectories in college and then they run a computer program it seems second nature.”

“But really it’s built on the hard work of all those people like Katherine Johnson that came before us and developed the methodologies for figuring out how a rocket needs to fly through the atmosphere and get to orbit.”

“The fact that we still rely on humans to this day to put together these trajectories and fly these missions she represents that capability that the best of us have.”

A team of George Mason University students are among the brains behind a satellite that launched into space this weekend as part of a collaboration with Northrop Grumman and Virginia Space that includes being part of a resupply mission to the International Space Station.

The 14 Mason undergraduate students involved and project advisor Peter Pachowicz watched anxiously on Saturday Feb. 20 as their ThinSat a small satellite developed by students that is capable of executing two experiments in space and transmitting data from Extreme Low Earth Orbit (ELEO) took off for space from Wallops Island in Virginia aboard an Antares rocket in the NG-15 Resupply Mission.

The mission of the Mason ThinSat payload called ASTERIA was to test a battery box with different types of thermal shielding and compare the relative effectiveness of two power-handling architectures. It will mean experimenting with using different power generation methods on a ThinSat.

“This means the world to me and is the highlight of my academic career!” said computer engineering graduate student Jay Deorukhkar. “Being able to participate in Mason’s very first satellite launch is a privilege beyond my imagination. The vision of Dr. Pachowicz and the hard work of everyone on the ThinSat team over the last two years is the reason we are here today. The successful launch will set Mason on a trajectory to many more launches and to further develop the satellite program.”

The two-semester senior design project included seven Mason electrical and computer engineering students three mechanical engineering students and four from systems engineering. Their efforts served as a rousing kickoff to Mason’s Engineering Week festivities.

Deorukhkar who was still an undergraduate when the project began in Fall 2018 was among the Mason students involved who have been able to gain practical engineering experience by designing and developing their own satellite payloads. The single-use Mason satellite launched from the rocket at 200 miles into the sky during the second of three planned staged rocket separations and will remain there for its five-day orbit lifetime while collecting data.

The Volgenau School of Engineering hosted a virtual party leading into the 12:36 p.m. launch.

ASTERIA is among 30 ThinSats aboard that were developed by university and grade-level STEM students to be launched into ELEO. Virginia Tech George Washington and American Universities are among the other schools whose students developed ThinSats.

“Northrop Grumman is proud to help advance STEM education through the ThinSat program” said Kurt Eberly Northrop Grumman’s director of space launch and launch vehicles. “This program allows George Mason George Washington and American University students to gain valuable engineering experience by developing satellites that will collect data in extreme low earth orbit.”

Roughly the size of a slice of bread ThinSats reduce the cost and size constraints of traditional satellites while still providing the opportunity to explore outer space.

But creating your own comes with its own specific challenges.

“It’s not just having an idea” said Pachowicz an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering “but it has to be finished at a high level that is acceptable to Northrop Grumman and it has to be tested in conditions the rocket would see such as vibration vacuum and temperature. Space is always challenging for engineers because of the environment and the many systems that you have to integrate into one unit. And when it launches you can’t touch it so you have to be very detail-oriented.”

The Virginia Space ThinSat program is comprised of a partnership between Northrop Grumman Virginia Space NASA Wallops Flight Facility Twiggs Space Lab and NearSpace Launch as well as university and grade-level schools across the country.

Northrop Grumman and NASA send supplies to astronauts on the International Space Station using the company’s Cygnus spacecraft which launches from the Antares rocket. Northrop Grumman has named the Cygnus spacecraft for this mission after NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson the African-American woman whose hand-written calculations were critical to America’s success during our first human spaceflight missions.

The Mason satellite project was developed in Spring 2019 and completed through in-house testing and modifications by Spring 2020 but the wait for an appropriate mission for its launch had been delayed by the global pandemic.

“We’re just happy it’s going to be launched” Pachowicz said “and we’re already looking forward to doing it again and to develop our own small-scale satellite platform which can be shared with others.”"

Did we just have the biggest hint yet of cruises being suspended for even longer and is it just a matter of time until all the major cruise lines issue vaccine requirements? Let’s get into it all in this crucial update on the cruise industry.

It has been a crucial week for the cruise industry as more cruise lines have now started to extend their suspensions into Summer 2021. Vaccine requirement for a safe return of cruising seems to be a growing trend and there are many more updates including return dates for two Carnival-owned cruise brands the name of P&O’s next excel-class mega-ship new options for Carnival cruises that are seven days or less and more. We’ll also get you updated on new extended suspensions announced from four cruise lines.

We start with Carnival-owned Costa Cruises which is now aiming to resume operations on March 27 2021. The cruise line has scheduled an Italian itinerary from the end of March while May will see cruises to international destinations.

The first ship to start sailing will be the company’s flagship vessel Costa Smeralda. Scheduled for March 27 2021 the vessel will be sailing on 7-day itineraries in Italy for one month before her itinerary will change to one-week cruises in the Mediterranean.

A second ship the Costa Luminosa will be joining Costa Smeralda from May 2 2021. The ship is scheduled to sail from Italy on cruises departing and arriving in Trieste.

Costa plans on more ships kickstarting operations with Costa Deliziosa on May 29 out of Venice Costa Magica on the same day from Bari Costa Pacifica out of Barcelona also on May 29 and Costa Firenze out of Genoa on May 30 2021.

You can check all the specific details on itineraries and health measures in our full post over on cruisehive.com.

AIDA Cruises will be opening its Spring 2021 cruise season on March 20. Originally scheduled to start on March 6 the cruise line had been forced to postpone due to various restrictions placed by the German government.

AIDAperla will begin sailing on March 20 out of Gran Canaria.

AIDAstella will also begin sailing on March 20 on an 8-day voyage from Mallorca.

AIDAmar will begin sailing on March 21 on a cruise with multiple stops in the Canary Islands and an overnight in Madeira.

AIDAsol will kickstart her cruises from March 20 on a voyage in Western Europe.

There will be strict health measures in place to make sure all guests and crew remain safe. This will be a clear sign to authorities around the globe that cruises can resume safely.

Crystal Cruises Requires Guests to be Vaccinated

The crucial shift towards needing a vaccine to go cruising is growing as Crystal Cruises has now become the largest cruise operator so far to issue this requirement.

So on February 18 2021 Crystal announced that all guests will need to prove that they have received a COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days before boarding.

The requirement is in addition to the cruise line’s health protocols and the proof will have to be shown before embarkation. There will still be a need for a negative test and health screenings.

The cruise line does expect crew members to be vaccinated but understands the availability in their home countries. For now it’s not a requirement but the crew will still need to have a negative test and meet all the health protocols in place.

Once vaccines are widely available Crystal Cruises will alter its stance and the crew will need to be vaccinated 14 days prior to joining their vessel.

Crystal Cruises has also decided to extend its pause on cruise operations. River cruises are now cancelled through May 2021 and for ocean cruises into June 2021. Operations are also cancelled through August 1 2021 for Yacht sailings and through August for its Expedition ship.

P&O Cruises Reveals Name of Next Mega-Ship

We finally know the name of P&O Cruises’ second excel-class cruise ship. The cruise line revealed that P&O Ionas‘ sister ship will be named Arvia which translates to “From The Seashore.”

The new ship will be a total of 184700 gross tons and she will have an identical design to her sister ship. Arvia will be fully powered by Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) part of a new drive of environmentally friendly vessels from parent company the Carnival Corporation. There will be enhancements to already successful concepts across the fleet along with features already found on P&O Iona.

She will join the fleet in December 2022 and bookings will go on sale in March. The cruise line will be releasing further specific details on Arvia in the coming weeks and months.

Carnival Details Cancellation Options

The Miami-based cruise line has offered new options to guests booked through July 31 2021 on cruises that are seven days or less. A letter was sent which was signed by Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy on January 15 2021 with the new cancellation options.

The cruise line mentions in the letter that the return of cruise operations in the U.S. is still not determined and the cruise line is still waiting on further guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). Guests can now choose what’s best for them moving forward.

So option one will allow guests to maintain their existing booking including any payments that still need to be made. They will receive a $100 onboard credit if the voyage does still go ahead. If the cruise is eventually cancelled and guests have not yet received the enhanced value offer they will receive what’s been offered during the suspension of operations to other guests.

For option two guests can cancel their voyage any time from now to March 31 2021 and receive a full refund. If the cruise was booked with a future cruise credit that could be kept along with onboard credit as long as the next cruise is booked by September 30 2021 for a sailing departing by April 30 2023.

Carnival Cruise Line also released new options for those who are booked on sailings longer than seven days and we have all that covered over on cruisehive.com.

Extended Cruise Line Pauses

We are now starting to see a new round of cancellations and already one major cruise line has cancelled until the summer! Let’s take a look at the latest new suspensions announced from the week.

Norwegian Cruise Line Cancels Until Summer

We start with Norwegian Cruise Line which has now cancelled all sailings through May 2021. Cruise ships won’t resume operations until June at the very earliest and for many ships they will remain on hold for even longer.

This includes all three operators owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. It came as no surprise as days prior to the announcement cruises for May had already been removed from the website.

Viking Cruises Cancels Until Summer

Viking Cruises became the second cruise line in the last several days to extend its pause on operations. River and ocean operations will remain on hold through May 31 2021 which means cruises won’t resume until June at the earliest.

The good news is that Viking vessels remain in a “warm layup” and ready to begin sailings with new health measures in place once government approvals are given. The update was released on February 17 along with a letter sent to any impacted guests and travel agents.

P&O Australia Cancels Into June

P&O Australia announced it will not be sailing any voyages until June 18 2021 bringing cruises in Australia to the start of the Southern winter cruise season.

At the start of the year the company had already decided to postpone all of its voyages to New Zealand and the hope is now that loyal guests will still re-book for a future cruise. Guests can look forward to two new arrivals to the fleet later in the year with Pacific Encounter out of Brisbane and Pacific Adventure out of Sydney.

Crystal Cruises Extends Suspension

As mentioned earlier Crystal Cruises extended its suspension on operations starting from May 2021 for river cruises and for even longer for ocean and yacht sailings.

Disney Cruise Line Removes May Sailings

And breaking news coming in as Disney Cruise Line has just removed all its remaining May 2021 sailings from its website. As of right now nothing has yet been announced.

Perez (24-6 MMA 6-2 UFC) will take on Matt Schnell (15-5 MMA 5-3 UFC) this spring at UFC 262. A person with knowledge of the booking confirmed the matchup to MMA Junkie following an initial report from MMA DNA. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the UFC has not yet made a formal announcement.

The UFC’s May 15 card though not publicly announced is likely to be UFC 262. No venue or location has been finalized.

Perez took a three-fight winning streak including stoppages of Jordan Espinosa and Jussier Formiga into a title shot with flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo this past November at UFC 255. A fairly sizable underdog in the fight around +250 Perez was submitted less than two minutes into the fight with a guillotine choke.

Schnell got back in the win column a little more than a month ago when he took a split decision from Tyson Nam on “Fight Island” in Abu Dhabi. That got him back on track after a knockout loss to Alexandre Pantoja in late 2019. Before that setback Schnell had a four-fight winning streak that had him in title contention himself.

This story has been updated to include a statement from Reliant a subsidiary of NRG Energy.

Two energy industry behemoths may soon consolidate even more of the electric utility market share as a result of a Friday-evening decision by the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

Companies saw sky-high wholesale prices over the past week and market analysts expect many small-to-midsize electricity providers to collapse over the next couple of weeks due to massive losses.

The decision from the Public Utility Commission or PUC could allow two companies that already hold more than 70% of the market share to scoop up even more consumers which experts worry will stifle competition and raise prices for everyone in the unregulated market in the long term. The unregulated market covers most of Texas except for places with public utilities like Austin and San Antonio or people who get their energy from a cooperative.

Tim Morstad works on financial security issues for AARP Texas with a focus on electric utilities.

""What this may lead to is further consolidation and further control of the retail electric market in Texas by large companies"" he said. ""And with less competition consumers can certainly get hurt. The last thing we need is unregulated monopolies. We’ve already gone through too much as a state with the pandemic and job losses and now this electricity emergency. We don’t need long-term consequences from an even less competitive deregulated electric market.""

The concerns from experts like Morstad boil down to who gets to provide electricity as power companies go out of business.

When private electricity providers go under their customers won't lose power because of what's known as the ""provider of last resort"" — POLR. When one company folds its customers are switched over to another provider so that consumers don't experience disruptions in service. Consumers have no choice in the matter. It just happens. POLR rates tend to be higher than what consumers originally signed up for with their energy company of choice.

On Friday evening the Public Utility Commission of Texas decided to open up voluntary POLR applications so that more companies can jump into the game.

""My concern here is that A: this is all very confusing for customers who are going to be stranded by companies that went out of business and B: they’re ultimately going to have to go choose again in a market that’s less competitive where they’re probably going to end up paying more over the long term"" Morstad said.

NRG Energy and Vistra Corp already control more than 70% of the market share. The Public Utility Commissioners indicated a desire to allow Reliant Energy a subsidiary of NRG as well as TXU Energy a subsidiary of Vistra to voluntarily take on more customers as other companies go under. In a press release the commission said this ""voluntary"" method will lead to ""a competitive rate rather than the higher so-called ‘POLR rate.'""

During the meeting Commissioner Arthur D’Andrea explained his reasoning for supporting the plan.

""I don’t want (consumers) to have to deal with getting put on a bad POLR plan"" he said. ""And then we have to call them and say ‘switch off this plan now and get on something better.' They should not have to deal with that now. And so this outcome is all about protecting them.""

D'Andrea went on to explain the potential downside of the move.

""I don’t love the fact that we are experiencing massive consolidation in the retail space"" he said. ""That’s not good but I think we have to focus on protecting those ratepayers right now and this is the way to do it.""

It's unclear how many private electric providers are about to go out of business but Morstad expects the fallout to be far-reaching.

""Our regulators must demand stronger standards to make sure that the companies that enter the market can withstand trying times like this"" he said. ""Because there can be tens of thousands or more electric customers who are left dangling out there if their power provider goes out of business.""

The commissioners believe larger companies like NRG and Vistra can handle that huge demand.

In a written statement NRG Energy subsidiary Reliant said “By volunteering to be a (retail electric provider of last resort) Reliant is working to minimize any impact to customers affected by retailers exiting the market. Customers who are switched to a POLR are free to choose another provider or plan at any time.”

Reliant did not directly address questions about market consolidation concerns. Vistra did not immediately respond to Texas Public Radio's inquiries.

""If we’ve got two companies at 75% (of market share) currently and (NRG and Vistra are) about to go to 80% 85% — maybe north of that who knows — then I think it begs some real questions"" said energy and climate consultant Doug Lewin.

""I mean how much competition do we have? And I want to be clear: people will say ‘Well there’s all these different (electricity providers) out there.' But NRG just bought Direct Energy so one of the two largest (electricity providers) just bought the third largest"" he added. ""So if you have Direct Energy you’re owned by NRG. If you have Green Mountain you’re owned by NRG. If you have Pennywise you’re owned by NRG. You know Vistra owns a bunch of different brands not just TXU. So is it the illusion of choice or is it actually choice?""

The commissioners gave companies until Monday at 3 p.m. to submit applications to become voluntary POLRs and they delegated the decision-making authority to Thomas Gleeson the executive director of the Public Utility Commission.

""So they left companies less than 72 hours (to apply)"" Lewin said. ""Obviously there’s some urgency to that because some of these companies will start going under quickly. But it doesn’t leave a lot of time for a lot of competition.""

Customer switchovers are expected to begin on Wednesday. At that point Morstad said the market will begin a long-term shift.

""They may end up with some of these customers for the long term"" he said. ""And that’s going to further consolidate the market and make it less competitive. And prices can go up for consumers.""

Mike Ullian managing partner of Warrenbrook Redevelopment isn't revealing details about his plans for the shuttered generating station but said he was intrigued enough by the project to move to the Buffalo area from Miami.

Ullian said he doesn't know why NRG embraced Warrenbrook's proposal only to reject it later but it is part of what some local officials say is a troubling lack of transparency regarding the sluggish sale process.

“Right now we are in a holding pattern waiting to see what NRG comes up with in terms of selling the property to a responsible party"" Tonawanda Supervisor Joseph Emminger told The Buffalo News. ""They’ve had over five years now to come up with a plan yet here we still are.""

NRG for its part defended its efforts to transfer control of the property.

""NRG is committed to engaging with local and state officials to secure a buyer that can successfully return the site to productive use"" spokesman Dave Schrader said in a written statement.

The electric generating coal plant once the town's largest taxpayer opened in 1916. When it closed 100 years later the River Road plant generated $6 million in local tax revenue and had 79 employees but also ranked as one of Erie County's worst polluters.

The main Huntley site covers 84 acres and includes more than 2.5 million square feet of building space across several structures. Two off-site parcels add another 124 acres.

The property has immediate access to the Niagara Thruway railroad lines and a water treatment plant but any redevelopment must factor in considerable cleanup costs.

NRG listed the plant for sale in 2018 and one year later had a letter of intent to sell the property to a buyer identified in January 2020 as WB Huntley Redevelopment a limited liability company tied to Warrenbrook. Then on June 30 NRG announced that the deal was off without explaining why.

In the months since there had been little movement concerning the property. In December however NRG launched a website huntleystationreuse.com and late last month opened a process to identify companies interested in buying and redeveloping the site. Any interested parties must sign a confidentiality agreement with NRG according to the site.

Huntley eminent domain effort ends with $24000 legal bill The Town of Tonawanda spent $24223 in legal fees in its effort to take over the former Huntley Generating Station through eminent domain. Attorney Marc Romanowski – then with the firm Hopkins Sorgi and Romanowski – represented the town against Huntley owner NRG Energy. The town detailed the payments between December 2018 and July 2019 in response to a

NRG said it has hired a national consulting firm Vita Nuova that specializes in sustainably disposing of challenging properties to help guide the Huntley sale process. Schrader said NRG wants to receive responses from prospective buyers by May.

""Potential buyers need to be vetted in terms of capability of completing the purchase and redevelopment"" he said.

Asked directly whether NRG would reconsider the deal with Warrenbrook Schrader said ""We will consider offers from all qualified purchasers.""

Previous coverage of the on-and-off deal did not reveal who is behind the company.

But emails obtained in records requests by public-interest groups and provided to The News identify Ullian and another developer Mike Edman as members of the group.

Ullian confirmed his involvement saying he has extensive experience in helping bring brownfield properties back to life. He's worked on redevelopment plans at the site of former power plants in Bridgeport Conn. and New Orleans as well as an urban brownfield site in midtown Miami with varying degrees of success news reports show.

""We can do something very transformative at Huntley as it is the cornerstone of the Town of Tonawanda’s vision for the future and we share that vision"" said Ullian who declined to get into specific plans for the site.

He said he is ready to close immediately on a deal for the property and Edman and other investors may be part of the group depending on the nature of any deal struck with NRG.

""The initial cleanup of a power plant makes this redevelopment much more of a niche business"" Ullian said. ""We have done several of these successfully.""

Sam Hoyt a former member of the State Assembly and state development official said he is working as an adviser to Ullian on the Huntley deal and believes he has the wherewithal to take on a project on this scale.

""It would be an enormous loss if he got frustrated and left town"" Hoyt said.

Tonawanda Huntley owner put legal fight on hold as sale nears The Town of Tonawanda is backing down from its legal effort to take over the former Huntley Generating Station to give the owner time to complete a sale of the property. The Town Board in June had voted to start eminent domain proceedings a move that followed two public hearings and drew the ire of Huntley owner NRG Energy.

Town officials say they've heard of companies that want to talk to NRG about the property but have not received any follow-up from Huntley's owner or more recently Vita Nuova its consultant.

""That concerns me"" Emminger said.

The town started an attempt to take over at least a portion of the site through the process known as eminent domain but ended it because officials did not want to interfere with the sale of the site. It is possible that Tonawanda could restart that process.

School town and county taxes paid by NRG for the Huntley site had shriveled as of last year to just $515000 combined. A state mitigation fund is providing money to offset the loss of the tax revenue from the plant but this pool of funding ends in 2023 – a deadline that looms over the sale process.

Assemblyman Bill Conrad a Democrat and former Tonawanda Town Board member said that the property has potential for a reuse that combines commercial and residential use and public access to the waterfront possibly by linking the site to the town's nearby Aqua Lane Park but he is concerned that so little has happened in five years.

""I just would like more clarity on what's going on"" Conrad said adding that the unused plant is ""an eyesore.""

Emily Terrana environmental justice organizer with the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York a group that has fought for years to end pollution at the Huntley station and to hold NRG to its responsibility to clean up the property said waterfront access for the public is key to any reuse of the site.

NRG is cleaning up a portion of the property through a state brownfield cleanup program that provides ""sweetheart"" tax credits that offset the cost of this work for the multibillion-dollar corporation Terrana said.

""I think it's been clear that NRG doesn't care about the will of the people in Tonawanda and Riverside"" she said. ""They are a business. They have a bottom line.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzBlNzQ2MjgwLWU3MmMtNDA4Ny05YzBkLWRmMmE3YWY4MmI3N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bills mount in Texas power market after freeze sends prices soaring,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

NVIDIA's takeover of Arm the UK-based chipmaker that licenses its technology to firms including Intel and NVIDIA itself has led to concerns that NVIDIA could use its position as Arm’s owner to block its rivals from accessing Arm’s intellectual property (IP).

While NVIDIA has said that it will do the opposite by retaining Arm’s neutral licensing model critics are skeptical and several big firms including many rival vendors have hit out at the deal.

Why NVIDIA Wants to Buy Arm

NVIDIA is famous among gamers for its graphics processing units (GPUs) chipsets that are used for rendering lifelike virtual worlds.

While they been seen as something of a niche market relative to “traditional” chipsets like microprocessors GPUs have gained a stronger market foothold with emerging applications such as machine learning. As a result major companies like Google and Facebook become customers of NVIDIA resulting in a sharp rise in its market capitalization and overall net worth which ended 2020 at $333.84 billion.

However it’s in NVIDIA's best interests to diversify itself and move away from solely manufacturing GPUs. Acquiring Arm would be an effective way to do this.

Block diagram of NVIDIA's GeForce 6 GPU architecture. Image used courtesy of NVIDIA

Not only does Arm “control” over 90% of the mobile market thanks to its processor architectures (PDF) which it licenses to the likes of Samsung and Qualcomm (who in turn sell components to Apple and other big end-users feeding into Arm’s royalties) but its technologies can also be found in almost any application that involves smart devices.

Controlling Arm would therefore give NVIDIA a wide scope to exert its influence on not only smartphones but also tablets computers wearables and more. It would also help NVIDIA to hugely influence markets such as data centers and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Vendors Up in Arms

The deal could potentially put NVIDIA on a collision course with some of the world’s biggest tech companies if it were to go back on its promises after the deal and favor its own business at the expense of others.

In terms of the chip industry Qualcomm is one of the biggest names that has publicly come out in opposition to the deal. It has registered its objections to regulators like the Federal Trade Commission the European Commission and the UK’s Competition and Market Authorities among others citing the potential for NVIDIA to become a “gatekeeper” of Arm’s chip technologies.

It has also been widely reported that the proposed acquisition is opposed by tech giants including Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. Both of these companies manufacture their own processors and rely on Arm architectures to power them.

Meanwhile Apple—whose new M1 Mac chips are based on Arm’s chip instructions—reportedly refused an offer to take over Arm in 2020 citing antitrust concerns. However Apple has remained silent on the pending acquisition.

Doomed to Fail?

Never before has the tech industry seen an acquisition of such a magnitude that would give one firm so much power influence and control. And it is looking increasingly unlikely that regulators will let it happen.

For the deal to go through it would need the green light from several regulators including those in the United States Europe and China.

In addition to the U.S. FTC opening what it calls an in-depth probe into NVIDIA's agreement to acquire Arm which has resulted in several information demands being sent to third parties European regulators have started conducting inquiries of their own.

The UK’s competition watchdog—the Competition and Market Authority—said in early January that it would begin a formal investigation into the acquisition. It has asked for interested third parties to comment on the deal so that it can fairly consider whether Arm will have an incentive to withdraw raise prices or reduce the quality of its IP licensing services should the deal be approved. The EU is also set to carry out its own investigation.

“We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower quality products” said Andrea Coscelli chief executive of the CMA in a statement.

It's also possible that China would refuse to approve the deal owing to the ongoing ""trade war."" Further the acquisition could deal a devastating blow to China because Arm’s CPU architecture is the only one that China can still use without U.S. approval. This would severely undermine the country’s efforts to supply 70 percent of its own chip demand by 2025 so it’s possible China will also voice opposition to the merger going through.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwODAtc3RvY2stZGlzYXN0ZXItaGVyZXMtd2h5LXRoZXJlcy1maW5hbGx5LWhvcGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 3080 stock disaster — here's why there's finally hope,"So continues the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30-series stock disaster: retailers are near-constantly sold out resellers hawk the cards at ludicrously inflated prices and digital currency miners bulk-buy what’s left to build gigantic Bitcoin or Ethereum mining rigs. If you’re just a PC owner wanting to know where to buy the Nvidia RTX 3080 you’re in for some drawn-out disappointment.

However there’s now cause for hope that such overwhelming demand can at least be eased. Nvidia itself has a two-pronged plan to get currency miners off the RTX 30-series’ case: first by intentionally hamstringing the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 as a potential mining tool. And secondly by offering a brand new range of processors that can perform a graphics card’s role in mining rigs without the need to buy up all of the gaming GPU stock of course.

The Nvidia blog details this new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line as well as the plan for the RTX 3060 when it launches later this month.

Firstly the RTX 3060’s software drivers will cut the card's Ethereum “hash rate” in half. This will essentially make it much slower at solving the complex mathematical problems that digital currency mining requires making the RTX 3060 less appealing to serious miners without affecting gaming performance.

That’s the stick but the CMP line is the carrot. These GPUs will be built from the ground up for efficient mining and not just like how some gaming graphics cards have a barely distinct “Mining Edition.” CMP cards will be more power-efficient and come without display outputs which mining rigs don’t use to enable better airflow.

In other words Nvidia is shooing miners away from the RTX 30-series family while also providing a superior alternative. The blog post says production of the CMP range won’t affect the RTX line’s already glacial supply speed too.

Nvidia RTX 30-series stock disaster: Mining madness

While this is only addressing one factor in the much wider problem of non-availability it’s clear that Nvidia is finally doing something to make RTX 30-series cards (or at least the RTX 3060) easier for ordinary consumers to get.

As frustrating as it might be to see photos of mining rigs piled high with Nvidia’s latest cards or even GeForce RTX-powered laptops a solely punitive approach to mining wouldn’t work. If there’s money to be made people will do it. And even if the RTX 3060 will suck as a mining card anyone desperate enough will still try it if there’s no alternative. Nvidia has therefore been wise in providing one.

It’s certainly a lot more than other powerful parties have done. The anti-reseller defenses put in place by retailers have proven woefully inadequate. Modern bots — the scripts resellers use to instantly buy stock the moment it goes online — are able to get past captchas and order limits with ease.

Board partners have done even less to make sure their graphics cards end up in the hands of regular consumers. Zotac even posted (then hastily deleted) an approving tweet showing someone’s RTX 30-series mining rig; if you can’t understand why that’s distasteful imagine a Victorian workhouse owner hanging a framed photo of roast chicken in front of all the hungry urchins.

Nvidia RTX 30-series stock disaster: More to be done

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Still there’s a long way to go. Nvidia is giving the RTX 3060 a fighting chance but ultimately it’s only dulling the appeal to a subset of miners. There’s nothing to dissuade the circling resellers. And even some conventional retailers are banking on demand being high enough to raise their RTX 3060 prices ahead of launch.

Nvidia itself was rightly criticized for the disastrous RTX 3070 RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 launch last year after which the company admitted ill-preparedness for “truly unprecedented” demand.

Then there’s the supply issue. RTX 30-series production is slow apparently due to a combination of raw materials shortages and the low yields of the 7-nanometer Samsung chips it uses. It’s extremely unlikely that stock levels will return to something approaching normalcy until Nvidia can actually produce enough cards to meet demand. This could take months even if the CMP range doesn’t slow it down further.

However the RTX 3060 launch goes Nvidia obviously has a lot more to do to end this graphics card shortage. But after months of next to nothing it’s finally moving in the right direction — and all it took was a couple of good ideas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYm94dGhpc2xhcC5vcmcvaG93LXRvLXNldC11cC10aHJlZS1tb25pdG9ycy13aXRoLW52aWRpYS1zdXJyb3VuZC1vbi1pcmFjaW5nL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vYm94dGhpc2xhcC5vcmcvaG93LXRvLXNldC11cC10aHJlZS1tb25pdG9ycy13aXRoLW52aWRpYS1zdXJyb3VuZC1vbi1pcmFjaW5nL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Set Up Three Monitors with Nvidia Surround on iRacing?,"This article shows you a guide for setting up your triple screens using Nvidia Surround on iRacing to get more immersion.

This console is currently the only one that is not based on a semi-custom solution. The new rumors indicate that Nintendo would not be counting on NVIDIA for the development of its next console. It seems that Nintendo for a hypothetical second-generation Switch would be thinking about an AMD solution.

Nintendo makes use of NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC which does not offer what the company would be looking for. The early vulnerabilities presented by this chip have forced Nintendo to look for alternatives. A solution without security holes is sought to avoid hacking and energy efficiency. In addition NVIDIA has long passed the SoC market due to its low profitability.

Nintendo Switch - Standard Console Neon Blue / Neon Red The new Switch adds two more hours of battery life compared to the old model to go from between 3 and 6 hours of duration to between 4 and 9 hours

Nintendo Switch transforms to adapt to your situation and allows you to play the titles you want even if you do not have much time. It is a new era in which you do not have to adapt your life to video games: now it is the console that adapts to your life

Three game modes: 1- TV mode (Bring everyone together in front of a screen and enjoy the game together. Place the console on the base of the Nintendo Swith to play in high definition on the TV) 2- Desktop mode (Share the screen  share the fun. Open the console stand to share the screen and have a great time with multiplayer games) 3 - Portable mode (Take a splendid screen with you wherever you go. Play with the Joy-Con controllers embedded in the console and take it with you Where you want)

Nintendo Switch has two controllers one on each side of the console that work together: the Joy-Con. If you attach the two Joy-Con to the Joy-Con controller holder they will function as a conventional controller while separately they will function as two fully functional individual controllers

Connect up to eight consoles for multiplayer games

Nintendo's Switch 2 could use AMD fixes

The problem is mainly that NVIDIA is not supporting its solutions based on ARM architectures. The partnership between the two companies has been weakening as NVIDIA is focused on other much more profitable segments. This has left the door open for AMD to take over the console market.

It seems that Nintendo is very aware of the new Exynos SoC from Samsung that integrates AMD RDNA solutions. A few days ago the first data from a chip in development with RDNA iGPU was leaked. This solution offered up to x4 times more performance than the Exynos with an Adreno 650 iGPU. This would allow the console to offer a 1080p FullHD resolution.

Samsung with this agreement increase the sale of its own SoCs based on 7nm lithography opening new markets. AMD will dominate the console market being the only manufacturer that offers competent solutions. Nintendo will get a very powerful and highly efficient SoC in its next console. We'll see if this is confirmed in the next few weeks because it aims to be interesting.

The unprecedentedly cold winter has already caused energy commodities prices to rise but in many locations power grids were not ready for freezing temperatures. Desperate times call for desperate measures so in Austin Texas a local energy company asked multiple industrial customers to temporarily shut down their facilities on February 16 in a bid to ensure the utility could supply enough energy to homes. Samsung Foundry Infineon Technologies and NXP Semiconductors (which runs two fabs in Austin) were among the Austin Energy customers who had to temporarily shut down their semiconductor production plants.

Samsung Austin Semiconductor's fab S2 in Austin Texas makes advanced chips using the company's 14LPP and 11LPP technologies on one production line as well as chips using mature (28nm – 65nm) nodes on other production lines. The fab is responsible for about 5% of the global 300-mm wafer output per month according to TrendForce. Therefore if the fab remains offline for about a week this will impact about 1% to 2% of the global 300-mm foundry capacity. Meanwhile it is unclear when Line 2 will return to normal operation.

Samsung's fab in Austin Texas produces automotive chips for Tesla and Renesas telecommunication chips for Qualcomm and various products for the company's own Samsung LSI division. In addition the facility also makes various SSD controllers using 14 nm – 40 nm nodes.

Controlled suspension of a semiconductor fab typically does not lead to production losses but it increases lead times for chips and causes a domino effect for other products in this case cars smartphones and SSDs.

TrendForce believes that the impact of the Line S2 blackout on the industry will be relatively limited but it may still cause some price hikes. Meanwhile since Infineon and NXP also had to temporarily suspend the production of chips the actual effect of the suspension on adjacent industries may be more significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A week after Michael McDowell won the Daytona 500 for his first career win after fourteen years sophomore Christopher Bell triumphed in Sunday’s O’Reilly Auto Parts 253 on the Daytona International Speedway road course after passing Joey Logano for the lead on the penultimate lap.

Defending race winner Chase Elliott started on the pole alongside McDowell in his best career starting position. Justin Haley (failed inspection twice) Erik Jones (engine change from the 500) and Garrett Smithley (unapproved adjustments) were sent to the rear.

Four of the drivers in the grid also ran the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona in January with Elliott finishing eighth overall in his debut. Xfinity Series driver and road course ace A.J. Allmendinger the best finisher of the quartet in the endurance race started thirty-fourth in his first Cup event since 2018. Austin Dillon who did not run the 2020 Cup RC race after a positive COVID-19 test and Cody Ware were team-mates for the 24 and respectively started the 253 in third and twenty-first.

Stage #1

McDowell’s day quickly took a nosedive when he overshot the hard-left turn one and fell out of the top twenty which was exacerbated by his right-front tyre going down prior to the green flag; after just one lap the tyre came off and resulted in a debris caution. Kyle Busch who won the Busch Clash on the road course a week prior suffered damage to his right front after making contact with Chase Briscoe and going through the grass in the opening-corner scramble. The two rejoined the race for the restart after meeting minimum speed.

Elliott and Dillon led the field as the race resumed on lap three though Denny Hamlin took second from the latter. Briscoe who lost power steering and ran the rest of the event without it spun in the frontstretch chicane and hit the “turtle” rumble strip though no caution was called while Quin Houff exited the race to address a mechanical issue. Logano moved up to third two laps later.

By lap ten only Hamlin and Logano were within ten seconds of Elliott. Meanwhile Busch and McDowell climbed into the top thirty.

Brad Keselowski pitted for a punctured left-front tyre after locking up his brakes while racing Ross Chastain through the frontstretch chicane. Jones (left rear) and Matt DiBenedetto (right rear) also had their own tyres go down the latter of which resulted in a yellow flag on lap 11.

Elliott was the first off pit road while Bell stayed out to inherit the lead for the lap 14 restart. William Byron received an uncontrolled tyre penalty for his stop. As Elliott continued to lead on the restart Bell faced a challenge from Keselowski that caused the latter to go into the infield grass.

As Elliott drove off to the steage win with Logano finishing a distant second Keselowski and Hamlin battled for third throughout the final lap; Hamlin would win the spot. Kurt Busch Kyle Larson Martin Truex Jr. Dillon Kevin Harvick and Chris Buescher rounded out the top ten.

Stage #2

Ty Dillon was penalised between stages for having a crewman over the wall too soon while Houff formally retired with an engine failure. Elliott continued to lead as the second segment began.

Allmendinger reached the top five by lap 23 while Truex took second from Logano. Keselowski missed the Bus Stop chicane and had to serve a stop-and-go penalty.

On lap 27 Ryan Blaney collided with Chastain the latter hitting the outside wall in turn six to produce a caution; during the period Tyler Reddick‘s car slowed after stalling. A poor stop for Elliott after a tyre rolled away gave Allmendinger the lead for the lap 30 restart ahead of Larson. Besides becoming the first driver of the race besides Elliott to lead a green-flag lap Allmendinger enjoyed his first Cup laps led since he had nine in the October 2018 race at Kansas.

Hamlin passed Allmendinger for the lead on lap 31. Allmendinger slid through the order when Ku. Busch Truex and Logano overtook him. Truex hounded Busch for the runner-up spot before left-front tyre wear forced him to fall back. Hamlin who finished second in the 2020 RC race scored the stage win while Busch edged out Logano for second. Fittingly last year’s event also saw Elliott and Hamlin respectively win the first two segments.

Bell Truex Elliott Byron Custer Allmendinger and Ky. Busch also finished in the top ten. Since Allmendinger is running for the Xfinity championship he did not receive stage points.

Stage #3

Daniel Suárez and DiBenedetto elected to stay out while Ku. Busch beat Hamlin out of the pits. A speeding penalty relegated Allmendinger to the back for the green on lap 38.

Busch Bell and Truex quickly swarmed Suárez to take the top positions as they exited the International Horseshoe. After a lap Busch got loose and hit a kerb in the Dogleg causing him to spin through the West Horseshoe grass and sink to twenty-seventh. As a result Bell inherited the lead with Elliott in tow.

Elliott took first with 30 laps to go and Busch subsequently spun Keselowski in turn one. Bubba Wallace suffered a speeding penalty when he pitted to clean his grille while Anthony Alfredo received a pass-through for missing the frontstretch chicane. Aric Almirola spun on lap 45 and dropped out of the top ten while Blaney hit pit road to address a left-rear tyre rub.

By the 21-to-go mark Elliott was pursued by a Joe Gibbs Racing contingent as Bell Truex and Ky. Busch followed while Hamlin fought with Elliott’s Hendrick Motorsports team-mate Larson. Truex pitted a lap later as part of the ensuing wave of green-flag stops. Elliott did so on lap 52 and retained his lead ahead of Bell.

Reports of light rain including the formation of a rainbow over the speedway began circulating with 16 laps left. On track DiBenedetto’s brake caliper broke leading to him missing the chicane before heading to the garage.

On lap 56 NASCAR called a caution for rain providing teams with the option to switch to wet tyres if needed. While strategising between slick or rain tyres also took place during Friday night’s Camping World Truck Series race and NASCAR has thrown yellow flags in lower-series events for the same reason skepticism surrounded the decision. Over the radio Busch commented he did not “know why we had a yellow I think it’s because of the show.”

“I mean yes I did technically see rain on track but the track conditions never actually worsened by them” Ware tweeted after the race.

“Disagree with throwing a yellow when it rains a little” tweeted IndyCar Series driver Scott McLaughlin. “That’s the fun part about Road Course racing making the right decision under green can make or break your race – don’t think they should throw a yellow unless it’s a monsoon…”

Eleven drivers led by Logano chose not to pit while Bell exited pit road first and Elliott had another bad stop. The race resumed with 12 laps remaining and Logano cleared Briscoe out of turn one. Reddick and Elliott were forced off course through the International Horseshoe; although Elliott recovered and barely avoided hitting an advertisement board Reddick was not as lucky as he drove into one which destroyed his front end causing a fire and caution.

A pair of Fords in Logano and Briscoe paced the field to the green with ten to go while Ku. Busch rebounded from his off-road excursion to restart third. As the field entered turn one Truex spun after wheel-hopping and colliding with Bell forcing Byron others to go off course to avoid him. While Truex’s incident did not result in a yellow Corey LaJoie hitting the wall in the West Horseshoe after contact with Elliott did.

Yet another restart commenced with eight to go as Logano and Busch occupied the front row. Logano cleared Busch out of turn one as Larson initiated a battle with Busch for second before an attempted pass on the inside in turn six sent him into the tyre barrier. Ky. Busch hit the wall on the frontstretch and neither incident resulted in a caution.

As Busch faced pressure from Bell for second Keselowski drove through the grass while fighting with Elliott behind them. Elliott eventually spun after a bump from behind by Hamlin snapping his hopes of a fifth straight road course win. Also adding to the turmoil was Briscoe’s hood coming up and he stayed on track before getting the black flag and pitting. Another downed tyre for Ky. Busch eventually resulted in him being penalised for speeding.

As chaos unfolded behind them Logano led Bell and Busch. On the penultimate lap Bell caught Logano as they went through the Bus Stop and ran side-by-side through NASCAR turns three and four. Bell cleared Logano in the frontstretch chicane to take the white flag. He gained breathing room as the two exited the infield and stormed off to his maiden Cup victory in just his second start for JGR.

Bell became the thirty-fifth driver in NASCAR history to win a race in all three national series the first Oklahoma native to win in the premier series and the first Cup driver to score his maiden win on a road course since Elliott at Watkins Glen in 2018. The victory also completes a Toyota sweep of the weekend with Ben Rhodes and fellow JGR driver Ty Gibbs respectively winning the Truck and Xfinity races; Gibbs’ victory was also his first in his series.

“This is definitely one of the highlights of my life so far” Bell began in his post-race interview with Fox Sports. “Just so incredibly thankful to be here at Joe Gibbs Racing. […] I prepared my whole life for this moment to race in the Cup Series. Last year was a huge learning curve for me and I’m very grateful that I got the opportunity to run in Cup and it definitely prepared me to move to Joe Gibbs Racing.

“Whenever we pitted we came out I liked where I lined up. But then the yellows kept coming and I thought the yellows were hurting me because I felt like I needed laps to get up through there. Honestly I didn’t think I was gonna get there Adam (Stevens crew chief) on the pit box kept telling me that I was gonna get there. I didn’t believe it[.]”

McDowell and Bell notching their first career victories in consecutive weeks marked the first time such a feat occurred in the Cup Series since summer 2019 with Alex Bowman (Chicagoland) and Haley (Daytona). However it has never occurred in NASCAR’s modern era; excluding the series’ inaugural season in 1949 the lone instance before 1972 came in 1950 with Harold Kite (Daytona Beach) and Tim Flock (Charlotte no relation to the current speedway).

“[Bell’s] the one that got through with tyres. One more caution lap would have been enough to at least have a door-to-door finish across the line maybe I don’t know” Logano commented. “[…] Just trying to get all I could on that restart trying to get out there as far as I could because I knew soon those guys with tyres were gonna catch us really quick. We’ve made gains with our Shell Pennzoil Mustang on road courses. We’re not quite good enough yet as you can tell our long-run speed’s off. We got to keep working to get that better but we maximised the day.

“I hate being that close but congratulations to Christopher; it’s his first win I know it means a lot and it’s always a special one. I’m happy for him but not so happy for myself at the moment.”

Despite leading a race-high 44 of 70 laps Elliott ended his day in twenty-first. Speaking with Fox he explained “When you have those late-race cautions like that you have a mixed bag of who stays and who goes. It’s a bit of a gamble either way. I thought tyres was the right move tyres won the race so I think it was the right move but you get back in traffic and it just gets to be so chaotic and then it just depending on who gets through and who doesn’t kind of determines how it’s gonna shake out.

“Too many mistakes: went off track and… yeah just bad day. We had a fast NAPA Chevy and I just appreciate the effort. I hate it for Corey I thought he was gonna take the lane again so I went to cross him over and I think that time he was actually gonna give me the lane so go figure. Try again next week.”

Ku. Busch fought back to finish fourth while Allmendinger finished seventh in his Cup return; it was Kaulig Racing‘s maiden top ten as a premier series team. McDowell rebounded from his poor start to finish eighth marking the first time in his Cup career that he had top tens in consecutive races; Ryan Preece also achieved this as he finished ninth. Ty Dillon finished nineteenth for Gaunt Brothers Racing in the team’s last event before taking a month-long break with plans to return for the Bristol dirt race in late March; the next four races will be the first without GBR on the entry list since the 2019 fall Phoenix race. Scott Heckert of Live Fast Motorsports finished twenty-eighth in his top-series début.

“What an experience” Heckert tweeted. “Lost third gear about halfway through the race. Fought as hard as we could after that and coming away with P28 is a great reward. We had the speed for a few more spots but that’s racing!”

Suárez who finished sixteenth had a less-than-pleasant end to his race. On Twitter he explained he “started to feel sick with 25 laps to go and threw up in the car with 15 laps to go (yes inside the helmet) […] Those last 15 laps were definitely NOT fun to run… You guys can imagine…”

It was Bell's first Cup win in just his second full-time season.

""This is definitely one of the highlights of my life"" said Bell who drives the No. 20 Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing. ""I'm just so thankful to be here. I feel like I've prepared my whole life for this moment.

""Last year was a learning curve for me and I'm just grateful for the opportunity to run in the Cup Series.""

More:Daytona Road Course weekend brings the action and makes Christopher Bell a NASCAR winner

Here are five takeaways from Bell's breakthrough at Daytona.

1. Running down Logano

Bell ran up front all afternoon but found himself nearly four seconds behind Logano with five laps to go.

However Bell managed to run down the 2018 Cup champion stringing together fast lap after fast lap on fresher tires before eventually passing Logano with two laps to go.

""He's the one who got through with (fresh) tires"" said Logano who took the lead with 15 laps to go after the leaders decided to pit. ""When he starts catching you a second-per-lap it gets hard.""

Bell 26 admitted he didn't think he would catch Logano as the laps started to tick down.

""I didn't think I had enough"" he said. ""I didn't think I'd get there. Man I didn't believe it.""

With Bell's win Sunday and Michael McDowell's triumph in last week's Daytona 500 this is the third time in Cup Series history the first two races of the season were won by first-time winners.

2. Elliott sputters late

Going for his fifth straight road win Chase Elliott had the car to beat early leading the first 27 green flag laps. However a late-race decision to pit under caution may have cost Elliott the win.

""It's a mixed bag of who stays and who goes"" he said of the decision to pit while others like Logano stayed out. ""It's a gamble and then it just gets to be so chaotic in the back.""

The defending champion got back up to fifth with eight laps to go but spun out while battling Brad Keselowski and finished 21st.

Denny Hamlin finished third followed by Kurt Busch and Keselowski.

3. Early trouble for the Daytona 500 champ

Michael McDowell was in trouble one turn into Sunday's race.

The Daytona 500 champion started on the front row but locked his brakes and overshot Turn 1 going off the course and well off the pace.

McDowell would rebound though and come home with an eighth-place finish.

4. Kyle Busch's forgettable day

Kyle Busch is probably happy to be heading home.

The veteran driver of the No. 18 Toyota had a forgettable afternoon suffering damage on the first lap of the race and cutting two tires in the final stage to finish 35th one lap down.

Busch finished 14th in last week's 500.

5. Kurt Busch mows the grass

Kyle Busch had an eventful day. Brother Kurt had an eventful lap.

Early in Stage 3 Busch had a bizarre wreck from the lead hitting an infield curb going into Turn 5 and blowing straight through the grass. Busch came to a stop just before emerging from the grass in front of the field but the damage was done.

He started the lap in first but was 27th when he got rolling again.

Gibbs took the lead on a restart in double overtime and held off the field by a comfortable 1.726-seconds at the finish line dropping to his knees to reflect after climbing out of his No. 54 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota – a car owned by his grandfather NASCAR Hall of Famer Joe Gibbs.

With his win in the Super Start Batteries 188 at DAYTONA Presented by O’Reilly Auto Parts Gibbs becomes only the sixth driver to win in his first series start – matching a feat achieved by NASCAR Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt in 1982 and most recently Kurt Busch 15 years ago.

Gibbs becomes the youngest driver to win an NASCAR Xfinity Series road course event. At 18 years four months 16 days he breaks the record held – ironically – by Cindric (20 years old).

By all measures it was an emotional victory following an intense exciting race on the 14-turn 3.61-mile road course. Cindric led the most laps 29 of the 56 – but could not catch Gibbs in the end.

“I just cannot thank everybody right now really this is like a dream come true for me it’s just awesome” said an emotional Gibbs who turned his first ever laps in the car and made his first career pit stop Saturday evening.

“I really didn’t think I had it there” he said of the intense racing at the end. “I fought back and we won.”

Gibbs teammates Daniel Hemric and Brandon Jones finished third and fourth followed by Jeb Burton and another of the JGR family Harrison Burton. Miguel Paludo Brandon Brown Justin Haley and Jeremy Clements rounded out the top 10.

A victory for Cindric would have been his second in as many races in 2021 and he turned in an inspired drive back to the front to contend for the win. He and A.J. Allmendinger – another road course racing star – collided while running first and second heading to the Stage 1 checkered flag. Allmendinger’s car was badly damaged and he ran laps down the remainder of the race.

Cindric’s No. 22 Team Penske Ford was damaged as well but the team made repairs and Cindric went to work. He returned to the race after multiple pit stops in 33rd place but still on the lead lap. His road racing skills and the team’s strategy calls ultimately put him in position to contend for the win.

“Obviously I don’t want to be racing to a stage that aggressively I’d love to see a replay and hopefully we can avoid something like that because obviously A.J. and I were going to be fighting for a win later” Cindric said.

“I hated having that much damage to our PPG Ford Mustang that early. Just seemed like he was trying to block there don’t know if he knew I was there or not. Sucks it’s over with and we salvaged a good finish. Congratulations to Ty.”

Gibbs grandfather who owns the team climbed down from the pit box and stood behind it to watch the final moments of the race. Clearly Ty Gibbs win was an emotional achievement for the entire family.

During a late race pit stop the teenager Ty was asking his team for peanut butter crackers. An hour later he was hoisting the biggest trophy of his young career.

“I don’t even know how to feel” Gibbs said. “This is really hard for me to explain. After my uncle [JGR President JD Gibbs] passed away it’s been hard for me. It’s just a dream come true. I’m just rambling. I’m excited. Mixed emotions for sure. This is just awesome.”

Of his tight-knit family Gibbs again wiped tears.

“The family is everything to me they do so much for me” Gibbs said. “I just can’t thank them enough this is just amazing; this is a dream come true. It’s all the man above I’m sorry I’m a wreck I didn’t think this was going to happen at all. This is awesome I can’t thank everybody enough watching and last week I had a terrible interview. I want to apologize for everybody I just can’t thank everybody enough. This is just amazing.”

Following the second race of the season Team Penske’s Austin Cindric holds the points lead by 24 markers over Joe Gibbs Racing’s Harrison Burton in second.

The NASCAR Xfinity Series races next Saturday at Homestead-Miami Speedway in the Contender Boats 250 (4:30 p.m. ET on FS1 MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).

The series found an easy solution — remain in Daytona Beach Florida for another week. Only this time drivers will race on the road course at Daytona International Speedway instead of the oval.

The Cup Series began the season with an exhibition race on the Daytona road course — the Busch Clash which Kyle Busch won when Chase Elliott took out leader Ryan Blaney on the final lap — before moving to the 2.5-mile oval for the 63rd Daytona 500. With NASCAR's most famous race under their belt drivers will get another crack at the road course — this time for points and a playoff berth.

STAGE LENGTHS (laps per stage): Stage 1: 16 Stage 2: 18 Stage 3: 36.

LAST TIME: Chase Elliott won NASCAR's inaugural race on the Daytona road course on Aug. 16 2020. Elliott led 34 laps including the final 13 and edged Denny Hamlin by a miniscule 0.202 seconds.

QUALIFYING: There was no on-track qualifying for the O’Reilly Auto Parts 253. Instead the lineup was determined by using NASCAR’s new competition-based formula:

Car owner’s finishing position from the previous race 35 percent: Team owner points ranking

Team owner points ranking 15 percent: Fastest lap from the previous race

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

He is a member of the LCpl Caleb John Powers Young Marines from Fredericksburg under the command of his father Kirk Ross. Ian is sophomore in high school and is home-schooled.

Ross is the top Young Marine in Division 2 which includes D.C. and five states: Delaware Maryland Virginia West Virginia and Kentucky. Over the course of the year he will travel to other units throughout the division to lead motivate and serve as a role model.

As Division 2 Young Marine of the Year Ross will escort WWII veterans to the annual Reunion of Honor trip to Guam and Iwo Jima in March. The island of Iwo Jima is open only one day each year for this special reunion of Japanese and American veterans.

“This is an amazing opportunity for me to give back to the program which has given me so much” Ross said. “I have had many opportunities and have experienced tremendous personal growth. I am excited to give back to the future leaders of our country.”

Ross joined the Young Marines at age eight and is in his seventh year in the program.

“Both of my older sisters were Young Marines so from a very young age I was able to see the program’s impact and opportunities” Ross said. “My sisters’ experiences inspired me to get involved.”

As a Young Marine he was named the Unit Young Marine of the Year and the Old Dominion Regimental Young Marine of the Year. In addition he is a Public Affairs correspondent.

Outside of the Young Marines Ross is involved in student council baseball and football. After graduating he plans on enlisting in the United States Marine Corps.

“Ian Ross is an extraordinary Young Marine” said Col William P. Davis USMC (Ret) national executive director and CEO of the Young Marines. “All our division winners show great qualities of leadership and reverence to veterans. Each lives a healthy drug-free lifestyle which is a foundation of the Young Marines.”

He is the son of Kirk Ross unit commander and who was a corporal in the USMC. His mother is Stephanie Ross who is the unit’s Adjutant.

How it works

The Young Marines organization is divided into six divisions across the United States. Each Division Young Marine of the Year must meet vigorous requirements such as graduating from Advanced Leadership School at the Young Marines’ National Leadership Academy maintaining high academic achievement in school and maintaining high standards of physical fitness.

In the spring Ross will represent his division in competition with five other division winners for the title of National Young Marines of the Year.

About the Young Marines

The Young Marines is a national non-profit 501 (c)(3) youth education and service program for boys and girls age eight through the completion of high school. The Young Marines promotes the mental moral and physical development of its members. The program focuses on teaching the values of leadership teamwork and self-discipline so its members can live and promote a healthy drug-free lifestyle.

Since the Young Marines’ humble beginnings in 1959 with one unit and a handful of boys the organization has grown to over 235 units with 8000 youth and 2500 adult volunteers in 40 states the District of Columbia Japan and affiliates in a host of other countries.

The penetration of semiconductor components classified as IoT is expected to grow from 7 per cent in 2019 to 12 per cent by 2025 said the report by market insights firm IoT Analytics.

Key components driving this IoT semiconductor growth are microcontroller units (MCUs) connectivity chipsets Artificial Intelligence (AI) chipsets and security chipsets and modules.

The increasing penetration of IoT semiconductors will necessitate chipmakers to put an enhanced focus on typical IoT requirements for example ultra-low power smaller form factor and built-in security.

The industry has profited from the need for more and higher-value semiconductor components for several newly emerging technologies.

Key drivers include big data analytics mobile communication gaming connected and semi-autonomous cars and to a large degree the fast growth of IoT devices said the report.

The number of active IoT device connections grew from 3.6 billion in 2015 to 11.7 billion in 2020 according to the estimate by IoT Analytics.

By the end of 2025 the numbers could grow to a total of 30 billion IoT connections according to the forecast.

The rise of the IoT semiconductor market is broad and touches most industry segments including industrial automotive energy and utilities and healthcare.

Consumer IoT devices such as smartwatches and smaller wireless accessories have seen a particularly high demand in recent years which has prompted several companies including some smartphone makers that were not making IoT devices a few years ago to move into the IoT ecosystem.

The current IoT device explosion will continue to drive the IoT semiconductor market and will likely lead to further semiconductor innovations amid higher production volumes said the report.

The unprecedentedly cold winter has already caused energy commodities prices to rise but in many locations power grids were not ready for freezing temperatures. Desperate times call for desperate measures so in Austin Texas a local energy company asked multiple industrial customers to temporarily shut down their facilities on February 16 in a bid to ensure the utility could supply enough energy to homes. Samsung Foundry Infineon Technologies and NXP Semiconductors (which runs two fabs in Austin) were among the Austin Energy customers who had to temporarily shut down their semiconductor production plants.

Samsung Austin Semiconductor's fab S2 in Austin Texas makes advanced chips using the company's 14LPP and 11LPP technologies on one production line as well as chips using mature (28nm – 65nm) nodes on other production lines. The fab is responsible for about 5% of the global 300-mm wafer output per month according to TrendForce. Therefore if the fab remains offline for about a week this will impact about 1% to 2% of the global 300-mm foundry capacity. Meanwhile it is unclear when Line 2 will return to normal operation.

Samsung's fab in Austin Texas produces automotive chips for Tesla and Renesas telecommunication chips for Qualcomm and various products for the company's own Samsung LSI division. In addition the facility also makes various SSD controllers using 14 nm – 40 nm nodes.

Controlled suspension of a semiconductor fab typically does not lead to production losses but it increases lead times for chips and causes a domino effect for other products in this case cars smartphones and SSDs.

TrendForce believes that the impact of the Line S2 blackout on the industry will be relatively limited but it may still cause some price hikes. Meanwhile since Infineon and NXP also had to temporarily suspend the production of chips the actual effect of the suspension on adjacent industries may be more significant."

Bloomberg

When Wim Coekaerts bought a hillside lot to build his California dream house there was an old horse barn a grove of olive trees and lovely views of Silicon Valley. But there was no electricity and the nearest utility pole to his bucolic acre was 550 feet away.

The town of Woodside requires new homes without utility service to pay for wires to be buried underground. Coekaerts faced a choice: pay PG&E Corp. roughly $100000 for engineering work and foot the enormous additional cost of the trenching or engineer a more personal fix.

Coekaerts who grew up in Belgium is a man who highly values reliable stable electricity - something PG&E has not always provided in recent years amid increasingly ferocious wildfires. And it's not just California: this week a winter storm has paralyzed the grid in much of Texas highlighting just how fragile the legacy system is. Coekaerts is senior vice president of software development at Oracle Corp. a legend in the open source community and is the longest serving board member of the Linux Foundation. We all want the lights to stay on; he needs to be able to run his servers and charge his electric Tesla Model S.

His house is the exact opposite of a small cabin: It was designed by an architect and spans 2800 square feet. Coekaerts started puzzling through the engineering challenges: What if he cut ties with PG&E? What would it take to build his own self-sufficient energy system with the electricity produced and stored on site? He started researching microgrids a small energy grid with control capability which typically means it can disconnect from the traditional grid. Coekaerts wanted to be autonomous from the beginning. He started looking at Tesla's energy products: the home battery known as the Powerwall and larger systems called Powerpacks.

""This is not a tiny home"" says Coekaerts as contractors put the finishing touches on the three-bedroom limestone house. ""A lot of people say they are off grid but they have a tiny house where they only need two solar panels. I didn't want to have a lifestyle where I'm just getting by. This is a normal house with normal energy consumption and I can charge my car if needed.""

In the developing world microgrids may leap frog traditional utilities much in the way that mobile phones made the need for landlines obsolete. In the U.S. military bases universities prisons and hospitals are turning to microgrids as a way to operate independently from the grid. The Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County about a half-hour's drive east of Oakland has a microgrid that allows it to operate as an island for extended periods.

Individuals are also pursuing them. Larry Ellison who serves on the board of directors of Tesla Inc. and is the chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle has expressed interest in a microgrid for Lanai the island in Hawaii that he bought in 2012. Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing that director James Murdoch purchased a Powerpack system from the company for $600000 in 2019 and that in 2020 a company affiliated with Ellison ""entered into an agreement to obtain preliminary design services from us for an estimated $400000 relating to the potential future implementation of a Tesla Energy system.""

PG&E has more than half a million residential solar customers and at least 18000 have installed battery energy storage systems. You hear a lot in California about ""solar plus storage"": solar panels to harvest sunlight into electricity paired with a home battery that can store the electricity for later use like after the sun goes down. Tesla markets the Powerwall as a backup for when the grid goes down. The Powerpack is mostly sold to businesses and utilities.

Coekaerts didn't want his system to function as a backup to the grid: He wanted to be independent of the grid. So through Luminalt the San Francisco company that installed his solar system he was able to get a Powerpack which is about 17 times what a single Powerwall provides. Tesla representatives have told him it is the first residential Powerpack installation that they know of though others are in the pipeline. The total cost including permitting labor for the installation and a federal tax credit for the solar system was roughly $300000.

His system which was activated in November combines 27 kw of photovoltaic solar panels with a 232kWh Tesla Powerpack. There are five ground-mounted arrays of 15 solar panels each or 75 solar panels total stretching across the yard. The Tesla Powerpack which on the outside just looks like a massive white box with Tesla's logo emits a low hum and is protected and surrounded by a tasteful wooden fence. During long summer days the system will probably generate far more electricity than he needs and neighbors have joked that they'll get out their extension cords.

PG&E has become something of a villain to many Californians in recent years. The state has staggered through increasingly devastating wildfire seasons and some of the blazes were sparked by aging utility infrastructure. Faulty PG&E equipment ignited the November 2018 Camp Fire an inferno that destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. In March PG&E's residential customers will see their rates increase as the utility which recently emerged from bankruptcy seeks to upgrade its equipment. When there's high wind and fire danger PG&E - which provides natural gas and electric service to roughly 15 million people from the Oregon border to Bakersfield - proactively shuts off power to tens of thousands of customers. Costs keep rising and outages are becoming more routine.

But it's not just PG&E: Last week the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which manages the flow of electric power to more than 26 million Texas customers was crippled by a snow storm that froze wind turbines kicked natural gas plants offline and resulted in widespread outages that left millions of people shivering in their homes. The climate crisis is here to stay and finding ways to function independently of utilities is gaining traction.

""On the one hand it's an engineering marvel to produce all of the needs of a modern house with locally produced power"" says Rich Brown a research scientist in the building technologies and urban systems division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. ""On the other hand it's still expensive.""

The future says Brown is aggregation: It is far more cost effective to build a microgrid if you're serving multiple people like an entire city block or a new subdivision. Brown and colleagues at the Berkeley Lab are working on a project called ""Ecoblock"" in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland that will serve about 25 housing units.

""Low income neighborhoods tend to have more pollution and the capital required to go solar or buy a battery is just too high"" says Brown. ""There's an equity issue. Ecoblock could be a model for how you could collectively take a neighborhood and make it more resilient and do it cost effectively.""

Coekaerts agrees. ""When it comes to apartment buildings and new homes instead of using the normal power grid they should do something like this"" says Coekaerts. ""It seems like a real scalable solution.""

Coekaerts knows that he is a rare early adopter. Besides being inherently tech-savvy he has the willingness - and the ample financial resources - to prove the concept. He's kept a detailed history of how his microgrid has performed over the last few months in hopes of sharing the information maybe via a YouTube video to educate others on the process. His main message is that it works: He has zero concern about running out of power.

""The climate is changing and you see that every year it gets worse"" says Coekaerts. ""I'm not a prepper but I want to be self-reliant. And there's a cool factor to this. If I can do this other people can do it too. It's nice to be on the forefront of something that is coming.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3ZpZXcvZmlkZS1vbmxpbmUtd29ybGQtY29ycG9yYXRlLWNoZXNzLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carlsen To Play In FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship,"Carlsen To Play In FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship

M&A Update: CrowdStrike to Acquire Humio for $400 Million

Palo Alto Networks and SailPoint Also Announce Acquisition Deals

Security firms Crowdstrike Palo Alto Networks and Sailpoint are making acquisitions to bolster their product portfolios.

Crowdstrike announced on Thursday a deal to acquire the cloud log management and observability technology firm Humio for $400 million.

On Tuesday Palo Alto Networks entered into a definitive agreement to buy the cloud security firm Bridgecrew for $156 million.

Meanwhile SailPoint on Thursday said it plans to acquire the SaaS management company Intello although it did not release the deal's financial details.

Crowdstrike and Humio

The endpoint protection firm CrowdStrike says its acquisition of 5-year-old Danish firm Humio will enable it to further expand its eXtended Detection and Response capabilities by taking in and correlating data from any log application or feed to deliver actionable insights and real-time protection.

JPMorgan analysts say the deal will enable CrowdStrike to identify issues across the broader tech infrastructure not just in endpoints. The analysts say CrowdStrike's new ability to ingest more information using Humio's technology will make it more competitive with companies such as Qualys.

CrowdStrike expects the mainly cash deal to be completed during its fiscal first quarter which ends in May.

Palo Alto Networks and Bridgecrew

Palo Alto Networks intends to use the acquisition of Bridgecrew to help enable its Prisma Cloud security platform to deliver security across the full application lifecycle.

""Bridgecrew is a pioneer in 'shift left' focusing on infrastructure as code where infrastructure configuration is codified during development. The proposed acquisition will enable Prisma Cloud to provide developers with security assessment and enforcement capabilities throughout the DevOps process"" Palo Alto Networks says.

JPMorgan researchers say Bridgcrew's technology enables companies to ensure software deployments don't open up potential security exploits.

Bridgecrew is less than a year year old and has about 50 employees JPMorgan says. The deal is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks fiscal third quarter which ends in October.

SailPoint and Intello

The integration of the New York-based Intello's technology into SailPoint's Identity Platform will help ensure SaaS apps are protected with the right identity security controls SailPoint says.

Intello is known for its technology that helps organizations discover manage and secure SaaS applications particularly ""shadow devices"" that are currently outside of IT's purview.

The acquisition of Intello's tech ""will provide greater visibility and control over what data these SaaS apps are accessing what information they may be importing and whether or not they are configured properly"" SailPoint says.

Other M&A Activity

Earlier this month the managed security service provider Herjavec Group reported it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by the private equity firm Apax Partners for an undisclosed sum.

Also SentinelOne announced the pending acquisition of the cloud analytics company Scalyr for $155 million in equity and cash.

Last month SonicWall disclosed that their internal systems were attacked using a zero-day vulnerability in their SMA-100 remote access devices.

A week later cybersecurity firm NCC Group discovered the zero-day vulnerability used in this attack actively exploited in the wild.

On February 3rd Sonicwall released a fix for the zero-day vulnerability and strongly recommended all users install it.

Additional safeguards added to the firmware

Yesterday SonicWall announced new firmware updates for SMA-100 series devices that provide additional safeguards discovered since their last update.

""Following up on the Feb. 3 firmware update outlined below SonicWall is announcing the availability of new firmware versions for both 10.x and 9.x code on the SMA 100 series products comprised of SMA 200 210 400 410 physical appliances and the SMA 500v virtual appliance.""

""SonicWall conducted additional reviews to further strengthen the code for the SMA 100 series product line"" SonicWall announced in an update to their SMA-100 security advisory.

While SonicWall does not describe what specific security fixes are in this update they stress that all users should ""IMMEDIATELY"" upgrade their devices.

The changes in this new update are:

The new SMA 10.2 firmware includes: Code-hardening fixes identified during an internal code audit

Rollup of customer issue fixes not included in the Feb. 3 patch

General performance enhancements

Previous SMA 100 series zero-day fixes posted on Feb. 3 The new 9.0 firmware includes: Code-hardening fixes identified during an internal code audit

These updates apply to the SMA 200 SMA 210 SMA 400 SMA 410 physical devices and the SMA 500v (Azure AWS ESXi HyperV) virtual appliances.

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

In the wake of the investment Wing VC Partner Jake Flomenberg will be joining Torii's board of directors.

The company was founded in 2017 by Tal Bereznitskey Uri Haramati and Uri Nativ. Haramati who serves as CEO is also the Head of Product of social media network Houseparty which rose to fame amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Torii employs 30 people half of them in the company’s headquarters in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ra’anana and the rest in New York. The new capital brings the company’s total raised to date to $15 million.

“We’ve reached the point where SaaS can no longer effectively be managed by humans” Haramati said in a statement. “Enterprises need a way of managing SaaS usage spend and security that will scale and keep employees happy but won’t impact agility and growth. With companies deploying on average 20-plus new SaaS applications every month this can only be achieved with intelligence-driven automation.”

“Over the past decade SaaS has gone from the exception to the norm. With the interconnectedness and ease of data collection that SaaS affords it is possible to unlock far more efficiency gains in the realm of software management through intelligence-driven automation than was possible on premise” Jake Flomenberg Partner at Wing Venture Capital noted.

Credit card sign-up bonuses are a nice way to earn a big chunk of cash back or rewards points. Most of the time you'll need to meet a spending requirement to get the bonus. For example a card may offer $500 back after you spend $3000 on purchases in the first three months.

That seems simple but there are several transactions that don't count towards the spending requirement. If you're not aware of these you could mistakenly think you've spent enough and miss out on a valuable bonus opportunity.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

1. Fees

Fees aren't classified as purchases. As such they won't get you any closer to a spending minimum.

An annual fee is the most likely to cause confusion. Credit card companies charge this on the first billing statement. It's easy to miss an annual fee that increased your balance if you don't go through all your transactions at the end of the month. And annual fees can make a big difference in how close you are to a bonus especially with feature-packed credit cards that cost $250 or more per year.

The same rule applies to other types of fees. So if you get charged a late fee or any other fee remember it won't count towards your card's bonus requirement.

2. Balance transfers

Some balance transfer credit cards also offer sign-up bonuses. Given that balance transfers are often large transactions you might think you've already hit a spending minimum after you've transferred one or two balances over.

Balance transfers aren't purchases though. That means they don't help you earn a bonus. If you open a balance transfer card with a sign-up bonus you'll need to make purchases to get the bonus. If you're trying to get rid of credit card debt keep in mind that it could be better to ignore the bonus altogether. That way you can focus solely on paying down those balances.

3. Refunded purchases

When a purchase is refunded it no longer counts towards the spending minimum on a bonus. You are after all getting the money back.

This could be a huge problem if you get a refund after the time period for the spending requirement runs out. Let's say a bonus requires you to spend $3000 on purchases in three months. You're at $2800 in purchases with two days left and then you make a $300 online order to go over the $3000 requirement.

A couple of days later the merchant says it can't fulfill your order and refunds the $300. You're back to $2800 in spending and there's no time left on the bonus offer. You'll lose the bonus in the most frustrating way possible.

If you're cutting it close on a spending minimum be careful not to make any purchases that could be refunded later.

4. Cash advances

A credit card cash advance allows you to get cash from your card. Once again this is a type of transaction that isn't considered a purchase.

Not only does it not help you get a sign-up bonus but a cash advance is also one of the worst ways to use your credit card. Cash advances start to accrue interest immediately the interest rate can be higher than other transactions and there's an additional cash advance fee. That's why credit card cash advances are never recommended.

5. Money wires

When you wire money and pay with your credit card that's also considered a cash advance. For example sending money through Western Union is a cash advance if you use your credit card.

You won't make progress towards a sign-up bonus this way and you'll also face those extra costs that come with cash advances.

Unfortunately it's not always clear which money-sending methods are classified as cash advances. Some forms of sending money with a credit card such as PayPal and Venmo are usually considered purchases.

Most services that could be considered cash advances will include a warning about this during the payment process. But to be safe you can also ask the credit card company to set your card's maximum cash advance amount as low as possible. That way any cash advances over the maximum will be automatically denied.

Don't lose your bonus on a technicality

Nobody wants to lose a bonus because of a technicality. The main thing to remember is that only purchases count towards a credit card's bonus requirement. When in doubt remember you can always contact your card issuer to double check how much you've spent towards your bonus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYmVzdC1hcHBzLWxpa2UtY2FzaC1hcHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 5 Best Apps Like Cash App,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYmVzdC1hcHBzLWxpa2UtY2FzaC1hcHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9hd2Vzb21lbHktd2VpcmQtYWxpYmFiYS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLWNoZWFwLWVsZWN0cmljLWdvLWthcnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Awesomely Weird Alibaba EV of the Week: Cheap Electric Go-Karts!,"Go-karts are the perfect fun-mobiles to bring out the kid in anyone. But gone are the days when you had to choke down a cloud of exhaust to the deafening roar of a single screaming overworked piston. These days electric go-karts are providing kids and adults alike with fast silent and clean thrills around the local track or the neighborhood lady’s rose bushes.

For this week’s entry in the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week I’ve found a pair of interesting electric go-karts for both adults and kids.

As much fun as the weird electric SUV I found for last week’s entry was $3200 may still be a bit steep for some people.

So what do you think of this $390 electric go-kart instead eh?

Designed for off-road racing as well as tarmac shenanigans this little thing can hit speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h) thanks to its 1000W motor.

The go-kart features an adjustable seat to fit kids and adults (it’s rated for “7+-year-olds”) and has a weight limit of up to 220 lb (100 kg).

Now I know what you’re thinking: “Sure I’m professional. I can handle this thing on two wheels at 20 mph. But do I want to put my 7-year-old at the wheel under those speeds?”

Fear not responsible legal guardian! The go-kart has three selectable speeds with options for slower 5 and 10 mph (8 and 17 km/h) settings with a key switch that your mischievous kids can’t alter without your help.











And if you’re worried about run time then don’t fret! The electric go-kart actually has a decent range of 20 miles (32 km/h) from its 48V and 20Ah (960 Wh) battery pack.

The only downside is that the battery is an old-fashioned lead acid brick.

The first mod I’d do to this thing is swap in a cheap new 48V and 20Ah Li-ion battery to shave off a few dozen pounds and add on a few more years of life expectancy.







For $390 this electric go-kart actually looks pretty darn decent.

You’ve got dual hydraulic disc brakes a choice between street or dirt tires reverse gear key switch diamond plate floor pan and even Ackermann steering with adjustable tie rods.

If you buy a bulk lot of them the company will even let you customize the karts with your own logo.

It kind of makes me want to buy a fleet and hand them out as gifts to the Electrek team so we can start our own racing league!

And if you’re saying “Hey… aren’t those go-karts just for kids?” – well then I’ve got something to show you.

You may have to go all high-knee on me but the video below shows an adult having some fun on one of these awesome little electric go-karts so I’m sure I could make it work.

Though when the roll hoop is at neck height I think your head becomes the de-facto roll hoop. That’s nothing a little helmet can’t fix though!

Folding electric go-kart for kids

Alright so that was my entry for the shared kid/adult electric go-kart. But if you want something purely for your kids I’ve got another cool find for you.

And not only is this one a fully capable electric go-kart for children but it even folds in half! That makes it easy to toss a few in your trunk and drive the family to the park for some fun that won’t bother your neighbors.

Now this one isn’t quite as fast or powerful as the first electric go-kart I listed. Its 500W motor only gets it up to 17 mph (28 km/h). But your wife will probably be happier with that anyways and you’ll still be able to keep up with your kids in your own 1000W 20 mph electric go-kart.













Even though this folding e-kart isn’t as powerful it has some nice features the other doesn’t have. The rear gets suspension and there are some other features like a horn and even dual motors. The two rear wheels are 250W hub motors leaving space above the rear axle for a 36V 10Ah Li-ion battery. There’s no heavy lead acid pack to swap on this one!

I actually discovered this awesome little folding e-kart thanks to Electrek reader Jeff S who shared it with me after buying his own. He had originally purchased an ONYX electric moped and then decided to get an electric go-kart for his kids so they could keep up with him.

His kids Presley and Chasey even did an awesome video review shown below. With their 100% “like” ratio I better watch out or they’re going to have my job soon!

The folding electric go-kart has a price of just $298 which sounds pretty darn fair to me!

I don’t see any option to customize it like the first go-kart but I can live with the Candy Apple Red colorway.

Shopping on Alibaba: A word to the wise

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Even though I’ve made plenty of purchases on Alibaba and AliExpress myself I always advise caution for newcomers.

There are tons of awesome products and even more awesome deals on both platforms but you also have to be careful. There can be a number of surprises such as unexpected fees or miscommunications resulting in products that aren’t exactly what you expected.

The best way to have a positive experience on Alibaba is to be as clear as possible when communicating with sellers. And always remember that if something doesn’t turn out both platforms have buyer protection that can help get your money back from escrow before it ever reaches the seller.

While AliExpress has a more convenient Amazon-like shopping interface it isn’t always the best deal. For example both that folding go-kart can be found on AliExpress but the price is much higher than on Alibaba.

And if you’ve bought something weirdly awesome on Alibaba or just went window shopping like me and found something cool feel free to share it with me! It just might get featured on next week’s edition of the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYml0YnV5LmNhL25ld3MvdGhlLWJpdGJ1eS1icmllZi13aG9zLWNoYW5naW5nLXRoZWlyLWJ1c2luZXNzLWZvci1iaXRjb2lu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bitbuy Brief: BTC Changing Business!,"Issue 131: BTC Changing Business!

Curbishley who is now 63 spent two spells at the club as a midfield player in the 1980s and 1990s and managed the side between 1991 and 2006. He also played for and managed West Ham United and played at both Aston Villa and Birmingham City as well as Brighton and Hove Albion.

But it was in his 15 years as Charlton manager that he achieved his greatest successes winning the first division play-off final in 1998. While the team were relegated from the Premier League the following season Charlton then won the division in 2000 leading to a seven-year Premier League stay.

Charlton were relegated a year after Curbishley departed in 2006 and have bounced between the second and third tiers of English football since then. More recently Curbishley has been appearing regularly on Valley Pass the live video coverage of matches broadcast while fans are unable to watch games in person.

The south stand at The Valley is already named after Jimmy Seed the manager who steered Charlton to the old first division in the 1930s and won the FA Cup in 1947. As with Curbishley Seed’s departure in 1956 was followed by relegation.

The petition has been created by Rick Everett the editor of Charlton fanzine Voice of the Valley. It has been backed by Peter Varney the club’s former chief executive who writes in the latest issue: “It is a no-brainer in my opinion. His achievements are every bit as good as Jimmy Seed’s and these are tributes that should happen to a person when he is alive not dead. Curbs will never say anything on the subject but he will love it.”

PEP,PepsiCo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhldGlja2VyLm9yZy8yODk1L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEtMi0xOS1hdW50LWplbWltYS1nZXRzLXJlYnJhbmRlZC1ieS1wZXBzaWNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aunt Jemima gets rebranded by PepsiCo,"PepsiCo Inc. rebranded Aunt Jemima a breakfast food brand most known for its pancake mixes and syrups to Pearl Milling Company ridding the brand of a name and logo that had carried a Black racial stereotype for years.

Pearl Milling Company then called Aunt Jemima was founded in 1888 by Chris Rutt in St. Joseph Missouri. The company created the first ready-mix pancake mix.

In a press release PepsiCo said that its signature red and yellow-colored packaging will remain on their products and that the new packaging and branding will be launched in June. Until then the existing Aunt Jemima branding will be sold without the logo of the Black woman.

The Quaker Oats Company which purchased Aunt Jemima in 1925 began to work on changing Aunt Jemima last summer. Although some have called for the rebranding prior to last summer the decision for the company to officially rebrand was heavily influenced by the police brutality and racial inequality protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd in 2020.

“As we work to make progress toward racial equality through several initiatives we also must take a hard look at our portfolio of brands and ensure they reflect our values and meet our consumers’ expectations” Kristin Kroepfl vice president and chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods North America said in a press release.

Until then Aunt Jemima had long been criticized because of its portrayal of Black people during slavery. Pearl Milling Company named the pancake mix after a song from 1875 called “Old Aunt Jemima” where performers on a show were in blackface according to a CNN article. And the original character of Aunt Jemima was portrayed by Nancy Green a woman who’d been born into slavery. She was hired to portray “a Black woman as a Mammy archetype” to promote the pancake mix the African American Registry said.

PepsiCo saw the recent rebranding as a step in the right direction. Even though Aunt Jemima was updated over the years with the intention to “remove racial stereotypes” PepsiCo acknowledged that it wasn’t enough to convey the respect and dignity they have for Black people today CNN reported.

In order to ensure the rebranding would show inclusivity The Quaker Oats Company worked with “consumers employees external cultural and subject-matter experts and diverse agency partners to gather broad perspectives” PepsiCo said.

However the change to Aunt Jemima has caused mixed reactions among consumers and critics.

Specifically some feel that although rebranding is progress it’s not enough progress.

One woman that was used as a model for Aunt Jemima was Lillian Richard. Her great niece Vera Richard Harris said she wanted to see the new packaging honor Richard’s contribution by having her name inscribed on it TMZ said.

Similarly Wanetta Cowan the great-granddaughter of Anna Short Harrington another model for Aunt Jemima said that she also doesn’t want the names of Aunt Jemima models to be forgotten. In an Instagram post Cowan wrote that she thinks that their descendants should be paid royalties.

“The racist left has once again “benefited” off the backs of AA’s for their “win” of wokeness. #auntjemima” one Twitter user wrote.

“So #AuntJemima is renamed to #PearlMillingCompany … Is Racism Solved Yet?” another user said.

Others disagree with removing the image of the Black woman character. Longtime Trump advisor Bruce LeVell said “Looks like the #cancelculture has removed the face of a beautiful black woman from the #AuntJemima brand.”

Aunt Jemima joined several other brands that have been pushed to rebrand products including Uncle Ben’s which is now Ben’s Original Mrs. Butterworth and Cream of Wheat.

Beyond changing the brand imaging and logo PepsiCo and Pearl Milling Company have pledged to invest in uplifting the Black community.

Pearl Milling Company will announce a plan to give $1 million to empower Black girls and women while PepsiCo has a $400 million five-year commitment towards advancing Black businesses and communities NPR reported.

The Quaker Oats Company also pledged a $5 million commitment to support the Black community PepsiCo said.

“We will continue the conversation by gathering diverse perspectives from both our organization and the Black community to further evolve the brand and make it one everyone can be proud to have in their pantry” Kroepfl said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXdib29tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL25ldy1idWJseS1ib3VuY2Utc3BhcmtsaW5nLXdhdGVyLXdpdGgtYS1raWNrLW9mLWNhZmZlaW5lLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1ub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Bubly Bounce Sparkling Water With A Kick Of Caffeine Available Now,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.chewboom.com/2021/02/21/new-bubly-bounce-sparkling-water-with-a-kick-of-caffeine-available-now/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXdib29tLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL25ldy1idWJseS1ib3VuY2Utc3BhcmtsaW5nLXdhdGVyLXdpdGgtYS1raWNrLW9mLWNhZmZlaW5lLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1ub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

A study in Israel showed that the vaccine is robustly effective after the first shot echoing what other research has shown for the AstraZeneca vaccine and raising the possibility that regulators in some countries could authorize delaying a second dose instead of giving both on the strict schedule of three weeks apart as tested in clinical trials.

Although regulators in the United States have held fast to the requirement that people receive two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine three weeks apart the British government decided to prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose allowing delays of up to 12 weeks before the second dose. The Israeli study could bolster arguments for emulating that approach in other countries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy12YWNjaW5lLWRpZC1wZml6ZXItcHV0LXByb2ZpdC1maXJzdC9hLTU2NjIyMDU20gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXZhY2NpbmUtZGlkLXBmaXplci1wdXQtcHJvZml0LWZpcnN0L2EtNTY2MjIwNTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID vaccine: Did Pfizer put profit first?,"The global pharmaceutical industry was able to develop multiple COVID-19 vaccines in record time. But has profit been put over human lives?

Last year Albert Bourla had a choice and he decided to take a massive risk. The CEO of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer could have made it easy for himself by accepting billions of dollars and participating in Operation Warp Speed the US government's initiative to create multiple vaccines as fast as possible. But he preferred to remain independent.

Bourla decided to invest $2 billion (€1.6 billion) in BioNTech a startup company in western Germany. His instinct was right: BioNTech came up with the formula for the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by the United States EU and other governments. By the end of the year Pfizer had produced 50 million doses of BioNTech's COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. The goal for 2021 is to produce more than a billion doses.

For many Bourla and BioNTech founders Özlem Türeci and Ugur Sahin are heroes in the global fight against COVID-19. The companies had previously collaborated on a flu vaccine in 2018 and their latest endeavor could save the lives of incalculable numbers of people.

Viagra and more

Pfizer got its start in 1849 when Charles Pfizer and his cousin Charles F. Erhart both of German descent founded Pfizer & Co. in New York and started producing an antiparasitic drug called santonin. Today Pfizer has more than 100000 employees and one of its bestsellers is the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.

New challenges arose in 2020 for the pharma sector which generated global sales of about $1.1 trillion in 2019. The rapid development of multiple COVID-19 vaccines showed what the industry could do under enormous pressure. However the real test might only be beginning for a sector that has often been accused of being more interested in maximizing profits than in saving lives.

'Pfizer exercised pressure'

A few weeks ago only the mass-circulation press was using the expression ""vaccine debacle"" in Germany. But now it's being employed widely by politicians and much of the population. The gist: while countries such as Israel the UK and the United States are vaccinating populations in large numbers the EU — represented by an incompetent negotiating team — failed to order enough doses in time. On top of that the narrative goes the EU was also too tightfisted.

Peter Liese a member of the European Parliament for the Christian Democrats and a medical doctor has regularly appeared on German TV talk shows to counter that argument.

""Pfizer exercised pressure on the European Commission"" Liese told journalists in August. ""Pfizer apparently did not initially want to accept something that is the law in Europe — namely that when a mistake is made and somebody is hurt there has to be liability.""

The negotiations dragged on and finally concluded in November. For weeks more than 20 lawyers for the US giant sat across the table while the European Commission's negotiators kept a low profile and did not comment on the proceedings.

In retrospect said Liese this was a mistake. ""The reasons were not communicated because the Commission always behaves well. There was the question of privacy and it did not want to disavow the negotiating partners"" he said. ""But it would have made a different impression on the public and there would have been more pressure on Pfizer of course.""

When Liese met with BioNTech scientists during the stalled negotiations process he could sense how uncomfortable they were with the issue. ""I could read in their eyes how embarrassed they were that a contract with the EU might actually not be signed despite the fact that they were working in the EU and had been given EU support to develop the vaccine in the first place"" he said.

The issue of liability has been lost in the current discussion but Liese said had the European Union not been so assertive on this point fewer people would be as willing to be vaccinated at all. ""Those in charge at Pfizer have failed to satisfactorily refute the accusation that they put profit over health"" he said.

Argentina's raw deal

Argentine Health Secretary Gines Gonzalez Garcia exploded when asked about Pfizer at a press conference earlier in February. The company he said had ""behaved very badly.""

In August 2020 more than 6000 Argentines responded to a call to participate in the phase 3 trials of the BioNTech-Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Half of them received the vaccine; the other half were given a placebo. The participants saw themselves less as test subjects than as contributors to the formalizing of a contract.

They would be disappointed. Not a single dose has been administered in Argentina now that the vaccine has been approved. Argentina is currently supplied with Russia's vaccine Sputnik V.

Government officials have also said they were unable to find an agreement with Pfizer regarding liability. ""They are responsible for the vaccine not the state"" said President Alberto Fernandez. ""The state buys and they sell. I do not understand why we should provide them with a standard that would absolve them of all civil and criminal liability.""

Pfizer has argued that the negotiations did not fail for reasons of liability but because Argentina did not want to pay for the transport of the vaccine which must be stored at an extremely low temperature.

""The market rules the world: That's just the way it is"" said Hugo Pizzi an epidemiologist based in the Argentine city of Cordoba. He has written more than 20 books about infectious diseases and is one of the country's most renowned doctors. ""And many countries are happy to follow these rules. How else can you explain that Canada has bought more vaccines for its population than necessary — instead of showing solidarity.""

Pizzi said he would tell Pfizer's CEO to ""think about the tragedy the world is going through about Argentina's contribution to the vaccine being approved and about what's most important: solidarity!""

Pfizer's 'mercantilistic approach'

Marta Diez Pfizer's country manager for the Andean cluster was ecstatic after signing a contract to supply Peru with 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. ""It is a great honor to work with the Peruvian government with the common aim to make the COVID-19 vaccine available to Peruvians as fast as possible"" she said.

Peru has one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the world. Almost 44000 of the 32 million inhabitants have died of the disease and Peru desperately needed the vaccine.

But Victor Zamora who was Peruvian health minister when the pandemic began a year ago is not in the mood for celebration. He was ""very surprised considering the run-up"" he said. ""Pfizer knows at what price and on what terms countries are buying. The company knows which countries have accepted which clauses.""

As in the EU and Argentina the negotiations with Peru were tough and went on for months. Though Pfizer has called the negotiations confidential Zamora said the company had demanded guarantees in case the state could not pay. There are reports that company officials sought access to state property as collateral.

Godofredo Talavera Chavez a surgeon and the president of Peru's medical federation said the company's strategy was no surprise. ""Pfizer has a mercantilist approach. They used their power to sell Viagra and they're doing exactly the same with the vaccine"" he said.

He said he was particularly angry because more than 300 of his colleagues had died in intensive care units as part of their efforts to fight the pandemic.

Wariness in Nigeria

When Aisha Isa Yusif heard about the BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine she got scared. Usually the lawyer and human rights activist is not easily perturbed but she has not forgotten what happened 25 years ago in Kano the fourth-largest state in the country.

""When I hear the word Pfizer I think about the lawsuit that Kano's state government filed against the pharmaceutical company” she said. ""My homeland wanted compensation for the families who were hurt by Pfizer.""

During the meningitis epidemic in 1996 children in Kano were administered an oral antibiotic called Trovan as part of an operation that was passed off as humanitarian. What none of the participants or their parents knew was that Trovan had not been approved. According to official statistics from the government 11 children died and more than 200 suffered permanent side effects such as paralysis blindness deafness and brain damage. Pfizer initially refused to take responsibility.

Eventually Pfizer settled out of court with the state of Kano and agreed to pay $75 million in damages. According to WikiLeaks Pfizer hired private detectives to look for evidence of corruption on the attorney general's part.

It is cases such as these that have made the Danish physician Peter C. Gotzsche one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest opponents. Though he used to work for the industry he grew increasingly skeptical and has now written several books in which he shares his misgivings including Deadly Medicines and Organized Crime: How Big Pharma Has Corrupted Healthcare.

""They are worse than any other industry"" he said. ""Corruption bribery and the marketing of non-approved drugs are expected."" He said Pfizer has been one of the world's worst companies in the past 50 years and can't understand why the pharma industry is allowed to make so much money in a pandemic: ""There should not be any patents for vaccines. They should not be a capitalist commodity but something produced for the general good.""

Could COVAX help?

Led by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations the global COVAX initiative would allow rich countries to pay for poorer countries to receive vaccines. The goal is to make available 2 billion doses in 2021 in order to put an end to the current acute phase of the pandemic.

""We are making up to 40 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine available to the COVAX initiative this year” Pfizer wrote in a statement in response to a request for comment from DW. ""Our priority is to bring treatment and vaccines to those who need them as fast as possible.""

Elisabeth Massute an advocacy officer at Doctors Without Borders is not impressed. ""It's just 2% of the vaccines that can be produced this year and next year"" she said. ""When you look at how many countries will actually be provided for by COVAX it's clearly not enough.""

Massute does not consider herself an opponent of the pharma industry but she said governments should stand up to the companies more.

""Why does the German government for example not say: 'We have given out so much money via our research ministry and we will therefore attach certain conditions to the funds?'"" she asked.

After all BioNTech received €375 million in research funds to develop the vaccine as quickly as possible.

What will be decisive for the industry's reputation in the long run will be whether it agrees to waive patents. India and South Africa have already requested that this be done so that any company in the world could produce vaccines.

Pfizer so far has insisted on reserving its intellectual property rights. Protection is relevant for several reasons according to the company. ""First because it helps to protect patients from potentially dangerous counterfeit and unapproved products. Second it protects companies from improper use. Patent protection enables voluntary licensing which allows us to make our products globally available in order to fight the pandemic"" it said in a statement.

Massute doesn't believe this is a valid argument. ""If you look at those who discovered insulin the patent was sold for a symbolic dollar. Or consider the researcher who developed the polio vaccine and asked: 'Could you patent the sun?' Health doesn't fit into the traditional rules of the system because human lives don't have a price tag.""

Australia has kicked off its COVID-19 vaccination programme a day ahead of schedule with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and an 84-year-old World War II survivor among the first Australians to receive the first dose of their coronavirus jabs.

Morrison and Jane Malysiak were injected with the COVID-19 vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech at a medical centre in Sydney on Sunday.

Paul Kelly the country’s chief medical officer also received his first dose.

“We’re here making some very important points” Morrison said moments before cameras captured Malysiak getting injected. “That it is safe that it’s important and we need to start with those who are most vulnerable and on the front line.”

Doses of the Pfizer inoculations which need to be kept at temperatures well below freezing were still being distributed to 16 vaccine hubs around Australia in preparation for the broader roll-out of the vaccines on Monday.

The group injected on Sunday included a small number of older Australians at the Castle Hill Medical Centre in the western part of Sydney aged-care staff as well as front-line nurses and workers.

The country is enjoying a second day without a single new COVID-19 transmission in the community officials said.

Up to four million Australians are expected to receive a COVID-19 vaccine voluntarily by March while the vast majority of the country’s population will be injected by the end of October.

Priority groups for the jab include aged care and disability care residents and workers front-line healthcare workers and quarantine and border workers.

Australia a nation of 25 million people has already secured 10 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as well as 53.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca jab.

On Saturday thousands of people attended anti-vaccine rallies in big Australian cities including Sydney Melbourne Adelaide and Perth to protest what they incorrectly believed to be mandatory vaccinations.

Australia has reported just less than 29000 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since March 2020. The country has ranked among the top 10 in a COVID-19 performance index."

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

College basketball insider Jon Rothstein reported on Sunday that Hoggard has narrowed the list of schools he’s considering. He’s currently in the transfer portal and is looking for a new home for next season.

Hoggard has started at point guard for the Spartans the past two seasons recording 10.7 points and 5.2 assists per game this past year. He however elected to enter the transfer portal following the season instead of coming back for a fifth year at Michigan State.

The “boys” – by now all in their late 20s or early 30s – were the summer’s cover stars for Like! a tween magazine. Despite the pandemic the band were still touring Spain. But these were gigs with a difference.

The concerts were sponsored by British American Tobacco (BAT) one of the world’s largest cigarette companies. At an exclusive gig in Madrid the front rows were full of influencers there to promote Glo BAT’s new heated tobacco product. Behind them sat people who had won tickets via a lottery on Glo’s Instagram account. For those who missed out there was another chance to see Dvicio at the Starlite festival in Marbella – also sponsored by Glo.

BAT has told regulators around the world that its new products including heated tobacco and oral nicotine are for current adult smokers. But as these sponsorships make clear it has launched an aggressive £1bn marketing campaign that leans heavily on social media concerts and sporting events which could have the effect of encouraging young people to pick up a potentially deadly tobacco habit that still kills 8 million people a year notwithstanding long-established rules aimed at preventing this.

A federal judge has OK’d the settlement via a court order meant to enforce the agreement’s terms.

Phillips 66 declined to comment — citing the ongoing court order as the reason — but did say in both recent and previous statements that safety is a priority.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District the regional pollution watchdog agency whose regulations Phillips 66 was accused in the lawsuit of violating said it is in negotiations with the refinery but did not provide details.

Phillips 66 reached a settlement with the nonprofit East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice after that group sued the refinery last year. In that lawsuit East Yard argued that Phillips 66 did not find and fix leaks at its Wilmington and Carson refineries as required by air regulators allowing toxic gases to escape into the surrounding community.

The communities around the Carson and Wilmington refineries including West Long Beach are among the most pollution-burdened in Southern California according to state data.

Leaking components are considered to be the largest single-source of volatile organic compounds or VOCs getting released at oil refineries the lawsuit said. Outdoor VOCs can cause smog a major contributor to respiratory diseases such as asthma and premature death according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“It is a significant victory for community members in the Wilmington-Carson and West Long Beach area to address these VOC emissions” said Oscar Espino-Padron an attorney with nonprofit environmental law group Earthjustice which represents East Yard Communities.

“This is a case that involves communities stepping into the shoes of the regulators” he added “and taking on big oil and really holding them accountable when regulators have failed to do so for far too long.”

Nahal Mogharabi AQMD spokeswoman declined to comment directly on the agency’s regulatory approach to enforcing its pollution control rules.

“South Coast AQMD is aware of Earthjustice’s action and claims and have had discussions with them” she said via email. “We are in active negotiations with Phillips 66 and as such we are unable to provide comments at this time.”

Phillips 66’s Carson refinery processes crude oil and the Wilmington facility turns that into finished products such as gasoline.

The Carson and Wilmington facilities together known as the Los Angeles Refinery produce 139000 barrels of crude oil and 85000 barrels of gasoline a day according to the company’s website.

Phillips 66 which has multiple refineries across the United States and Europe invested about $7 billion in “environmental protection projects and sustaining capital” from 2015 to 2019 according to the company’s 2020 “Greater Good” sustainability report.

Since 2012 that report said the company has reduced air emissions including VOCs by 22% at its refineries.

And while the company declined to comment on the settlement refinery spokesman Kenneth G. Dami said the company works “unceasingly” to provide a “safe and reliable operation” for the community and environment.

Dami echoed what another Phillips 66 spokesman said in April in response to Earthjustice filing a notice of intent to sue on behalf of East Yard.

“At Phillips 66 we take seriously the safety of our people communities and the environment” that company spokesman said at the time “and have teams of people who work each day to ensure that we abide by regulations set by governing agencies including those in the state of California.”

The lawsuit came after environmentalists reviewed a 2017 AQMD study of local refineries found significant discrepancies between actual and reported annual emissions from the plants Espino-Padron said.

The twin Phillips 66 refineries were “by far” the worst offenders he said. The onsite emissions of cancer-causing benzene from the Wilmington refinery for example were 200 times higher than what was actually being reported in annual emission inventories Espino-Padron said.

Under the settlement which came about after months of negotiations Phillips 66 will also have to pave a 30000-square-foot dirt parking lot in Wilmington that is a major source of dust for nearby homes and replace at least 150 valves at the plant with “leakless” versions.

In its latest filing in November the Oracle of Omaha omitted confidential information from the public Form 13F report and filed it separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission according to the filing.

A form 13F is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter for managers with more than $100 million in assets under management according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A manager can request to withhold information if for example the reportable security is likely to be substantially harmed by public disclosure of Form 13F data.

Buffett Berkshire Hathaway’s CEO has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last one was in 2015 and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 according to Barron’s.

While it’s possible that the mystery stock will remain mysterious Barron’s notes that it could be sizable in the $5 to $10 billion range.

Speculations are abounding. Take Gary Black former Aegon Asset Management CEO for example who polled his 51000 followers on Twitter about the mystery investment. The “potential Cinderellas” are Disney Paypal Google and FedEx according to one of his tweets.

In August Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its investments in Japanese companies: Itochu Marubeni Mitsubishi Mitsui and Sumitomo. The five stocks have rallied an average of 23% since then boosting the combined value of Berkshire’s stakes from below $6.4 billion to nearly $7.7 billion in under six months according to a Business Insider article. The article notes that these picks are quite unusual as Buffett has “mostly preferred American companies such as Apple American Express Bank of America and Coca-Cola throughout his career.”

The project aims to provide 101 affordable and 205 market-rate units along with commercial uses within walking distance to the neighborhood BART station. Holliday Development is responsible for the project.

The revision comes after financing and subsidies for affordable housing were unfavorably changed. Due to internal financing constraints and political considerations at the Oakland Housing Authority the developers were not given a Project-Based Voucher reducing their expected subsidization for affordable housing. For this reason the one hundred below-market-rate units will be sold for residents with low-income earning 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI). In previous plans 50 units would be 80% AMI residents and the other 50 for 50% AMI residents.

The five buildings will rise one four and five stories with a pinnacle height of 62 feet. A total of 253400 square feet will be produced with 180830 soiree feet for apartment use 53170 square feet for supportive housing and 19400 square feet for a light industrial maker space.

The design team in charge of phase one is led by Lowney Architecture and the Miller Company Landscaping. The affordable housing residences will range in size from studios to two-bedrooms. An administrative building will also provide community and commercial spaces. Lowney’s design will be clad with stucco board-formed concrete walls anodized bronze window frames and wood-like panels.

David Baker Architects are leading the master development plan.

Phase 1 is expected to take twelve months to complete after groundbreaking. The project is a twelve-minute walk from the West Oakland BART Station along the retail-dotted 7th Street thoroughfare.

CORRECTION: Earlier version of this article stated that the revising permits have been approved by the city. The permits have been accepted for review and are currently going through CEQA Determination.

Dating from the 13th century it is in poor state having suffered a fire but is one of a number of heritage projects that has carried on - albeit at a slower pace - during the pandemic as conservationists continue to care for buildings that might otherwise be lost.

Darren Barker director of the Great Yarmouth Preservation Trust said despite appearing an absolute bargain the purchase represented a ""conservation deficit"" because so much needed spending on it.

He said funding worth £28000 had been secured from Heritage England for emergency repairs topped up by £5000 from the trust.

Repairs continue at Pinnacle Tower reusing many of the historic peg tiles thanks to a grant from @HistoricEngland @HE_EoE pic.twitter.com/JgvPAXlNov — Great Yarmouth PT (@GreatYarmouthPT) February 19 2021

A sustainable end-use will need to be found to make it pay its way but crucially buildings owned by the trust only need to break even to justify any spend.

The tower sits behind Poundstretcher (the former BHS) and an element was also in the ownership of the Black Swan Care Group which operates Park House.

The windows roof and external masonry are the priorities.

After completing the purchase conservationists finally got in in December last year (2020) to be confronted by an eight inch layer of pigeon mess.

Meanwhile the trust is making progress on a number of other schemes.

North West Tower

The landmark tower next to the White Swan fish shop and restaurant (until recently a pub of the same name) has been empty for some time serving previously as a Broads Authority visitor centre and then as offices.

Following an asset transfer from the borough council the preservation trust aims to convert the tower into a holiday let after the success of a similar project undertaken at South East Tower.

There the property was almost fully booked when people were allowed to visit.

""It's a good use of a problem building and South East Tower has proved to be really busy. Even during Covid it was almost solidly booked the whole time"" Mr Barker said.

Funding of £99900 has been secured from the Architectural Heritage Fund for the refurbishment and change of use.

The Iron Duke

The derelict pub in North Drive next to North Denes Primary School has long been a source of frustration among its supporters whose determined efforts saw it gain protective listed status.

The distinctive Art Deco pub was bought by the trust last month (January 2021).

As well as repairs a feasibility study is needed to find a new use for the building - with a pub use among all options being considered.

The Norfolk Nelson Museum

The former Norfolk Nelson Museum which is looking to reinvent itself as a free-to-enter gallery.

Norfolk's only museum dedicated to Admiral Lord Nelson opened in 2002 but sadly closed at the end of 2019 amid financial challenges and declining visitor numbers.

Mr Barker said losing the collection was ""a huge shame"" as having it in Great Yarmouth was an important part of the maritime town's cultural offer.

The building in South Quay is owned outright by the preservation trust and after being completely emptied now needs a new use.

""It leaves us with a problem or an opportunity"" he said. ""It is a big building purposely converted as an exhibition space and really nicely done.

""We could have converted it to residential which would have created a lot of income but we did not think it was the right thing to do - although it might be an option in the future.""

We want to recruit an art/gallery specialist to help us develop open and manage a new gallery The Yarmouth Gallery in the former Nelson Museum. Initially for 6 months please email darren@gy-pt.org for details. pic.twitter.com/OUfs4wQ0tK — Great Yarmouth PT (@GreatYarmouthPT) January 21 2021

Instead the aim is to use it as a professional gallery showing works of celebrated local artists with international reputations as well as temporary exhibitions from established names.

He said he hoped it would be of regional significance drawing people from Norwich Cambridge and beyond.

Great Yarmouth Preservation Trust is a not for profit registered charity working to preserve save enhance and promote the historic built environment.

The trust has also recently bought Greenwoods Menswear in King Street which it intends to turn into a heritage centre and the former Dee Thai restaurant at 160 King Street Yarmouth's only surviving example of a 16th century jettied timber frame building.

It is hoped some of the best exhibits from the Ben Burgess collection of Nelson memorabilia  which was on display until last year can be shown at the heritage centre

Businesses need to go beyond the interests of their companies to the communities they serve.

— Ratan Tata

Very recently Mahindra&Mahindra got caught on the wrong foot. A picture of M&M’s Board meeting was shared on Twitter where a user pointed out use of disposable plastic bottles in the Board meeting of the company. This promptly led Mr. Mahindra to take ownership and banish plastic bottles from meetings and replace them with environment friendly alternatives.

This simple narrative points out how the organisers of the meeting had not thought about the environmental implications of their actions (using plastic bottles in the meeting) when the company is actively promoting environment and sustainability and this may be true for employees across organisations as well who are neither aware nor committed to the environmental cause. Hence employee involvement becomes important for organisations on its sustainability journey.

Smart organisations know how to ensure core values of their organisation. This can happen either by persuading their employees or by giving them a clear message. Organisations that have made greening a priority for themselves expect environment-centric behaviour from their people and this has resulted in judicious utilisation of resources. In addition consistent assessment of environmental impact while taking business decisions recycling and repurposing of resources and adoption of sustainable forms of different resources are some other important parameters.

About sustainability and sustainable workplace

Sustainability greening the corporation environment management are gradually becoming a part of the corporate vocabulary. The way the natural resources are extracted and consumed from earth it is going to be very difficult to replenish them timely. It is often discussed in various forums that for generating the resources we spend in one year; earth takes around 1.5 years for the re-generation. Hence it can be assumed that there will a requirement of the capacity of almost two Earths by 2030 to keep pace with the present natural resource consumption and the requirement will be of three planets by 2050.

Experts have always warned people about the impacts of climate change global warming and the recent onset of a pandemic (Covid-19) can completely rewire people’s brains. All these environmental changes will have far reaching impact on humanity and life force on the planet. They would be designed in such a way that they work on People-Planet-Profit (PPP) methodologies thereby providing benefits to all the stakeholders. The architecture building resources employed would all be designed to function on the principles that promote sustainability.

The current requirement is towards developing long-term meaningful relationships and self-discipline for attaining effective results. Thus the design of the workplace is such that supports the basic and core idea in a more accommodating and comprehensive manner. When employees find the conviction among their leaders they tend to behave in the manner that supports green and sustainable way of working in an interrelated and interlinked way.

A Green workplace is an eco-friendly and focused organisation and leans towards the adoption of business practices that are justifiable in nature energy efficient and well suited to the complex as well as the ever-changing world of business. It advocates the model based on 3Rs — reduce reuse recycle. It is not only green building and green infrastructure rather it has a much broader scope. It encompasses green competencies green attitude and green behaviour which is combined synergistically to help the organisation become green or sustainable. Values are the essential characteristic that both employees and organisations uphold and operate at multiple levels (societal organisational and personal) thus playing a fundamental role in shaping the organisation’s culture with regard to a shift towards greater sustainability.

Recent changes post COVID-19 in HR domain

A lot of changes were witnessed post pandemic in the very year of 2020. Globally work from office (if not completely zero) definitely went on the downward slide. At the same time thanks to availability of internet and online working option availability work was not completely shut. Although work from office was very less we could experiment with new working models in most of the industries and companies of all sizes. Though we were not meeting face-to-face we were still connected. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology and digital way of working tremendously.

Now with the vaccine discussions new experiments are being made. These include mixing remote and office work with safety protocols remote management making tough decisions like giving furlough to some workers and growing the roles of others engagement learning monitoring and evaluating so that the business of the organisation can happen as usual.

Global industry analyst Josh aptly mentioned at Perspectives 2020 “For us in HR it is really time to be the heroic leaders of the response.” Thus the HR is experimenting and finding opportunity the year of the pandemic and following year with huge expectations and the big acceleration of the transformation HR. The enmeshment of all aspects has caused a sea change in how people are working at home trying to strike a balance among all the domains. The clear segregation between home and work has today blurred integration of an ‘enforced’ kind is in place which is different from the voluntary work from home which companies used to give. Thus in this process of transformation and management of unprecedented situation HR is gaining smoothly greater importance.

Work from home and sustainable aspects

Although work from home (WFH) was always advocated by HR fraternity (as it gives the opportunity for work life integration) the actual decision to allow the employees to work from home was a difficult one. The principal risk to firms when allowing employees to work from home is a potential inability to monitor those employees to the same degree as would be possible if he or she worked in a traditional office setting.

During Covid-19 the situations are different. Everyone is worried about health and wellbeing related aspects. Supply chains are disrupted. Daily and essential works are taking more time as no support is available at home. More than that all the family members are available all the time at the same place with kids not going outside is an extra burden of managing and engaging them with lots of patience. Along with that the individual difference of managing stress and uncertainties also play an important role when we talk about working effectively in this uncertain times.

Working from home or working at home during the Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to realities which are reframing the very fabric of our social occupational and emotional lives. Not surprisingly the nature of WFH has changed in recent years. The cost to employees of corresponding with employers and co-workers quickly and effectively from a distance has fallen dramatically.

In addition the positive aspect can be seen that resource utilisation has gone down dramatically. Due to WFH and less commute required there seem chances that less people need to travel daily to attend their office. The proposed hybrid model where WFH and online learning will be a part lesser vehicles will be needed on the road. That will definitely impact positively in terms of less polluted air and sound. Due to digital way of working prevalence of electronic mail video conferencing software and mobile communication through ubiquitous cellular communications networks the usage of electricity paper will go down.

Leaders’ role in encouraging sustainability in organisations

The role of leadership is pivotal when it comes to encouraging sustainability in organisations. CEOs across companies and nationalities are understanding the importance of committing to sustainability and have placed sustainability on top of their agenda. The seriousness of climate threat and the growing awareness around environmental issues is making organisations commit to reducing their contribution to pollution and depletion of natural resources.

Indian organisations have become a part of the Carbon Disclosure Project thereby committing to reduce emission of carbon but recent reports show that CDP has pulled up 20 Indian organisations for their weak sustainability disclosures. A recent CDP India Annual Report also discloses that Indian companies are not much concerned about deforestation and do not make a realistic assessment of the impact of their business on deforestation. This indicates the lack of seriousness to take environmental impact of business into consideration.

This is where the role of leadership becomes highly significant. Integrating sustainability and environmental issues into the strategy of business can only be accomplished at the highest level of the organisation. We need the business leaders to step up and work towards becoming more sustainable. There are examples of leaders who have taken sustainability to be the most important driver of their business. Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia is a shining example of sustainable leadership. He not only made sustainability a part of his business but also worked with his vendors to make their businesses sustainable. His contribution to the environment extended to producing documentaries meant to sensitise people on environmental issues.

Late Y.C. Deveshwar former Chairman of ITC Ltd. in an interview had stated that sustainability was a key to gain competitive advantage. The current CEO and MD of ITC Sanjiv Puri has committed to stretch goals to improve its sustainability performance by 2030 by replacing 50% of the company’s energy consumption with renewable sources.

These examples demonstrate the leader’s vision and commitment to sustainability are imperative to promote sustainability in organisations. The leader’s beliefs about environmental conservation and a vision centered around sustainability can motivate employees to take up the environmental cause. The leader can become a catalyst in enhancing awareness on sustainability by making it a part of the corporate vocabulary and integrating sustainability as a value in the organisation’s culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The inaugural edition of the FIDE Online World Corporate Chess Championship an online team competition for companies has a surprisingly large and strong turnout. With a total of 284 teams from 78 different countries registered the event will bring together 1467 players.

The list of participating companies includes giants like Amazon Samsung Ford Microsoft Gazprom Facebook Siemens Dell Technologies Bosch Airbus IBM Boeing Sony Intel ArcelorMittal Equinor HP Twitter Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Vodafone Sberbank American Express Deutsche Bank UBS Oracle Credit Suisse and Airbnb.

The line-ups of the teams are fairly impressive as well. Especially nice is the participation of the world champion who represents the company Kindred the online gambling operator of e.g. Unibet that has been sponsoring Carlsen since early 2020. Giri is logically playing for Optiver a Dutch trading firm that has supported him during the past five years of his career.

Other top players are playing by invitation as companies were allowed to have one invited player for the event. In total 204 titled players will take part in the competition including 36 grandmasters.

There are also some top executives playing for their teams like Bernhard Spalt CEO of Erste Group Bank and Tomislav Topic who is the CEO of the telecom company Telconet in Ecuador.

However the strongest executive is the two-time French champion and former top player GM Joel Lautier a member of the Supervisory Board of Sovcombank who will make a temporary comeback to play in the championship.

Format

Each team consists of four players including at least one male player and at least one female player. In each team only one player can have a standard rating higher than 2500 in the FIDE rating list for November 2020.

Registered teams are divided into two pools (East & West) of approximately equal strength and of close time zones. Pool matches are played on February 19 and 20. Qualified teams enter the playoff phase played on February 21.

The Eastern pool matches begin at 7 a.m. Pacific (16:00 CET). The Western pool matches begin at 5:30 p.m. Pacific (2:30 a.m. the next day CET). The time control is 10 minutes plus a 2-second increment for the whole game.

Donations

There was no entry fee of any kind for this competition. However FIDE is organizing a fund-raiser in cooperation with the platform Softgiving  and participating companies are encouraged to donate towards one of three social projects currently being developed by FIDE: Chess in Education programs for underprivileged children Chess for people with Disabilities and the FIDE veterans support program.

All donations received through this link will count towards the leaderboard offered by Softgiving. The most generous donors will appear on top of the leaderboard (donation amounts won't be revealed).

At the end of the event the team that has donated the most funds for those charity causes will be invited to the FIDE World Championship Match 2021 taking place at Dubai World Expo in late 2021 with accommodation expenses covered for three nights and VIP tickets to attend three rounds of the match.

Update Feb. 17 2021: An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that GM Johan Hellsten is the CEO of Telconet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2ZhY2Vib29rLW1ha2VzLWEtcG93ZXItcGxheS1pbi1hdXN0cmFsaWEtYW5kLW1heS1yZWdyZXQtaXQv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vZmFjZWJvb2stbWFrZXMtYS1wb3dlci1wbGF5LWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1hbmQtbWF5LXJlZ3JldC1pdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook makes a power play in Australia – and may regret it,"AP — For years Facebook has been in a defensive crouch amid a slew of privacy scandals antitrust lawsuits and charges that it was letting hate speech and extremism destroy democracy.

Early Thursday though it abruptly pivoted to take the offensive in Australia where it lowered the boom on publishers and the government with a sudden decision to block news on its platform across the entire country.

That power play — a response to an Australian law that would compel Facebook to pay publishers for using their news stories — might easily backfire given how concerned many governments have grown about the company’s unchecked influence over society democracy and political discourse. But it’s still a startling reminder of just how much power CEO Mark Zuckerberg can wield at the touch of a figurative button.

“Zuckerberg’s flex here shows how he can disrupt global access to the news in a heartbeat” said Jennifer Grygiel a social media expert and professor at Syracuse University. “No company should have this much influence over access to journalism.”

Facebook’s move means people in Australia can no longer post links to news stories on Facebook. Outside Australia meanwhile no one can post links to Aussie news sources such as the Sydney Morning Herald.

Facebook said the proposed law “ignores the realities” of its relationship with publishers that use its service to propel their stories across the world. Technology and media experts have also raised serious concerns. Timothy Berners-Lee the British computer scientist known as the inventor of the World Wide Web told an Australian Senate committee in January that the law’s precedent could ultimately wreck the internet by requiring payment for links that have always been free.

The law hasn’t gone into effect. Negotiations between the tech companies the Australian government and the country’s media giants — most notably Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. — may result in changes to the final version.

What can’t be changed though is Facebook’s dramatic if ham-handed attempt to force the issue. The company provided no warning of its decision to block Australian news and applied the ban so clumsily that it blocked many innocent bystanders.

“As the law does not provide a clear guidance on the definition of news content we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted” said Facebook spokeswoman Mari Melguizo who added that the company would unblock any pages that were blocked by accident.

Facebook’s reaction was not justified even if there are issues with the law including the fact that it stands to benefit media giants like News Corp. said Elizabeth Renieris director of the Notre Dame-IBM Technology Ethics Lab. Facebook’s show of strength she said is “really going to wake up regulators around the world.”

“If it is not already clear Facebook is not compatible with democracy” Rep. David Cicilline a Rhode Island Democrat who heads a House subcommittee that has urged antitrust action against the company wrote on Twitter. “Threatening to bring an entire country to its knees to agree to Facebook’s terms is the ultimate admission of monopoly power.”

On Thursday Democrats announced they would hold new hearings to curb online platforms and update antitrust laws.

Billions of people around the world rely on Facebook for essential information — not just news but charity and government pages emergency announcements and other important channels. Facebook’s news blackout swept up many of these including humanitarian organizations like Foodbank Australia and Doctors without Borders in Australia who found their pages temporarily disabled.

The ban affected articles from large international news organizations and small community newspapers or radio stations alike. Those restrictions potentially deprived many Australians of basic information on Facebook about COVID-19 or the country’s fire season — from a company that bills itself as committed to building “connection and community.”

Australian publishers felt a blunt impact. Analytics firm Chartbeat said the Facebook ban resulted in a 24% drop in overall traffic to Australian publishers by late Friday morning local time compared to 48 hours earlier.

The tech company has faced years of criticism for allowing misinformation around politics and the coronavirus to fester on its site. Critics said they fear that stripping Australian users of legitimate news sources will only worsen that problem.

“Playing this game in Australia is going to fill peoples’ feed with misinformation” Tama Leaver an internet studies and social media expert at Curtin University in Australia said during an interview Wednesday with Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Perth.

But a news-free Facebook might also be a more pleasant experience for many people said Drew Margolin a professor of communication at Cornell University. Facebook would have been better off if it had given Australians a choice to opt out of news he suggested. If many did the company could have used that for leverage with the government and publishers.

“What happens when they say we’re ready to turn it back on and we say please don’t?” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXNzYmFzZS5pbi9uZXdzL0ZJREUtT25saW5lLVdvcmxkLUNvcnBvcmF0ZS1DaGVzcy1DaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtRGF5LTItUmVwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIDE Online World Corporate Championship: LIC TCS Chennai and TCS Bangalore make strong finish,"Day 2 of the FIDE Online World Corporate Championship witnessed the exit of all Indian teams at the conclusion of Stage 1.

No Indian team in the knockout stage

The highest rated Indian team LIC lived up to its expectation and finished third in East C group. However it was not enough as only the group topper advances to the next stage as per the tournament rules and regulations. Tata Consultancy Services Chennai had a real good chance but starting out Day 2 with a loss against CSOB diminished their chances. Thus no Indian team made it to the knockout stage. That's not all even Carlsen and Giri's teams Kindred and Optiver respectively were unable to advance to the next stage.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXdheXRvZ2FyZGVuLmNvbS9zY3VscHR1cmFsLXBvdHMtaW4tdGhlLWdhcmRlbi13aXRoLXN0ZXBoZW4tcHJvY3Rlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter,"Pin 11 11 Shares

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Key Metric: Prices

Procter & Gamble rode higher prices to increased revenue in its December quarter. But the upcoming earnings report could show the lowest price increases by the consumer goods seller since the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with analysts forecasting that P&G will hike prices by 2.75% in the quarter.

It could also be the first quarter in two years where the consumer giant reports positive annual growth in sales volumes with expectations for a 0.35% increase.

Business Spotlight

Procter & Gamble’s report comes after it detailed a $1.3 billion impairment charge for its subsidiary razor business Gillette forcing the company to reduce its 2024 full-year guidance for earnings per share (EPS). However the company said it was able to maintain its forecasts for 2024 revenue and it announced earlier this month that it would boost its quarterly dividend by 7%.

“We delivered strong results in the second quarter enabling us to raise our core EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook for the fiscal year” Procter & Gamble CEO Jon Moeller said after last quarter's results.

Analysts expect P&G to report its largest gains from its biggest segment with revenue from fabric and home care expected to jump about 3.6% year-over-year while its healthcare sales are also expected to increase across the same period. After beauty and personal care products helped pace P&G’s sales in fiscal 2023 revenue from that segment is expected to ease about 1%.

A component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) P&G has had a good start to the year with its shares up about 6.8% so far in 2024 as of Tuesday compared with a DJIA that has started the year flat. It’s also outperforming the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector (XLP) exchange traded fund (ETF) which also is flat so far this year."

Financial regulation in the UK is designed to protect consumers and maintain the stability of the financial system. The regulatory framework is overseen by several regulatory bodies including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) both of which operate under the auspices of the Bank of England.

The FCA is responsible for regulating conduct in the financial services industry including setting standards for consumer protection and preventing financial crime. The PRA is responsible for regulating the prudential aspects of financial services including the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions.

Together the FCA and PRA work to ensure that financial institutions operate in a safe and transparent manner and that consumers are protected from fraud and other financial crimes.

Key regulations and requirements

There are several key regulations and requirements that CFOs need to be aware of including the following:

Anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations

The UK has a comprehensive AML and CTF regime in place which is designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Under these regulations financial institutions are required to conduct due diligence on their customers report suspicious transactions and maintain records of their transactions.

As a CFO it is essential to ensure that your business complies with these regulations. This may involve implementing appropriate AML and CTF policies and procedures training staff and conducting regular audits to ensure compliance.

Data protection regulations

Data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are designed to protect the personal data of individuals. Under these regulations financial institutions are required to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal data.

CFOs should ensure that their business is fully compliant with data protection regulations including implementing appropriate data protection policies and procedures and ensuring that all staff are trained in data protection best practices.

Capital adequacy requirements

Capital adequacy requirements are designed to ensure that financial institutions maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operating in the event of financial distress. Under these regulations financial institutions are required to maintain a minimum level of capital based on the level of risk in their business.

CFOs should ensure that their business is fully compliant with capital adequacy requirements which may involve regularly monitoring the business’s capital position implementing appropriate risk management practices and developing contingency plans for potential financial distress.

Market abuse regulations

Market abuse regulations are designed to prevent insider dealing and market manipulation. Under these regulations financial institutions are required to establish appropriate controls to prevent market abuse report suspicious transactions and maintain records of their transactions.

CFOs should ensure that their business complies with market abuse regulations which may involve implementing appropriate controls and training staff on market abuse prevention best practices.

Financial regulation in the UK is essential to protect consumers maintain financial stability and prevent financial crime. CFOs must be aware of the key regulations and requirements that apply to their business including AML and CTF regulations data protection regulations capital adequacy requirements and market abuse regulations.

The government has tweaked the guidelines for strategic disinvestment  making security clearance mandatory for all bidders who put in price bids for buying a central public sector enterprise (CPSE).Now financial bid would be opened by the evaluation committee on strategic disinvestment only after potential suitors get security clearance an official told PTI.The government has lined up sale of its majority stake along with management control in BPCL IDBI Bank  BEML Pawan Hans  Neelachal Ispat Nigam in the next fiscal.The guidance note framed in 2018 on strategic disinvestment by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) said that the core group on disinvestment headed by Cabinet Secretary would decide on a ""case-to-case"" basis whether security clearance is required for the ""highest bidder"" for the sale.If the highest bidder does not get security clearance the next highest bidder was given the option to match the price offered by the highest bidder.An official said that the guidance note has been tweaked since it has come to notice that there was some ambiguity in the rules.""Once financial bids are opened the whole process of strategic sale almost reaches its closure. If after that security clearance is not obtained by the highest bidder then the whole process goes waste"" the official added.DIPAM - the government agency managing the stake sale - had last week issued a proforma of the application for security clearance of the acquirers.According to the performa any interest of more than 10 per cent in the bidding entity would require disclosures of parentage and beneficial ownership to get a security clearance.In case the acquirer is a sole bidder then it has to share with the government details like nationality address parentage unique ID number of the country of residence and passport number of its directors and partners.Also a self-declaration regarding the nature and extent of presence/operation of the bidder in China and Pakistan if any would have to be provided by them.In a strategic sale bidders first put in expressions of interest or preliminary bids. After that due diligence is carried out by the government while the bidders also get access to company's books.Following that eligible bidders are shared the share purchase agreement following which price bids are put in by interested bidders.The government has budgeted to collect Rs 1.75 lakh crore from disinvestment in next fiscal up from Rs 32000 crore estimated to be mopped up in current fiscal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvc2JpLXBheW1lbnRzLXRvLWxhdW5jaC15b25vLW1lcmNoYW50LWFwcC1mb3ItbG93LWNvc3QtcGF5bWVudHMtMTIxMDIyMDAwNjA0XzEuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvY29tcGFuaWVzL3NiaS1wYXltZW50cy10by1sYXVuY2gteW9uby1tZXJjaGFudC1hcHAtZm9yLWxvdy1jb3N0LXBheW1lbnRzLTEyMTAyMjAwMDYwNF8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SBI Payments to launch YONO Merchant app for low-cost payments,"SBI Payments a subsidiary of India's largest lender State Bank of India will launch YONO Merchant App to provide low-cost digital payments infrastructure to merchants  the bank said on Saturday.

This story has been updated to include a statement from Reliant a subsidiary of NRG Energy.

Two energy industry behemoths may soon consolidate even more of the electric utility market share as a result of a Friday-evening decision by the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

Companies saw sky-high wholesale prices over the past week and market analysts expect many small-to-midsize electricity providers to collapse over the next couple of weeks due to massive losses.

The decision from the Public Utility Commission or PUC could allow two companies that already hold more than 70% of the market share to scoop up even more consumers which experts worry will stifle competition and raise prices for everyone in the unregulated market in the long term. The unregulated market covers most of Texas except for places with public utilities like Austin and San Antonio or people who get their energy from a cooperative.

Tim Morstad works on financial security issues for AARP Texas with a focus on electric utilities.

""What this may lead to is further consolidation and further control of the retail electric market in Texas by large companies"" he said. ""And with less competition consumers can certainly get hurt. The last thing we need is unregulated monopolies. We’ve already gone through too much as a state with the pandemic and job losses and now this electricity emergency. We don’t need long-term consequences from an even less competitive deregulated electric market.""

The concerns from experts like Morstad boil down to who gets to provide electricity as power companies go out of business.

When private electricity providers go under their customers won't lose power because of what's known as the ""provider of last resort"" — POLR. When one company folds its customers are switched over to another provider so that consumers don't experience disruptions in service. Consumers have no choice in the matter. It just happens. POLR rates tend to be higher than what consumers originally signed up for with their energy company of choice.

On Friday evening the Public Utility Commission of Texas decided to open up voluntary POLR applications so that more companies can jump into the game.

""My concern here is that A: this is all very confusing for customers who are going to be stranded by companies that went out of business and B: they’re ultimately going to have to go choose again in a market that’s less competitive where they’re probably going to end up paying more over the long term"" Morstad said.

NRG Energy and Vistra Corp already control more than 70% of the market share. The Public Utility Commissioners indicated a desire to allow Reliant Energy a subsidiary of NRG as well as TXU Energy a subsidiary of Vistra to voluntarily take on more customers as other companies go under. In a press release the commission said this ""voluntary"" method will lead to ""a competitive rate rather than the higher so-called ‘POLR rate.'""

During the meeting Commissioner Arthur D’Andrea explained his reasoning for supporting the plan.

""I don’t want (consumers) to have to deal with getting put on a bad POLR plan"" he said. ""And then we have to call them and say ‘switch off this plan now and get on something better.' They should not have to deal with that now. And so this outcome is all about protecting them.""

D'Andrea went on to explain the potential downside of the move.

""I don’t love the fact that we are experiencing massive consolidation in the retail space"" he said. ""That’s not good but I think we have to focus on protecting those ratepayers right now and this is the way to do it.""

It's unclear how many private electric providers are about to go out of business but Morstad expects the fallout to be far-reaching.

""Our regulators must demand stronger standards to make sure that the companies that enter the market can withstand trying times like this"" he said. ""Because there can be tens of thousands or more electric customers who are left dangling out there if their power provider goes out of business.""

The commissioners believe larger companies like NRG and Vistra can handle that huge demand.

In a written statement NRG Energy subsidiary Reliant said “By volunteering to be a (retail electric provider of last resort) Reliant is working to minimize any impact to customers affected by retailers exiting the market. Customers who are switched to a POLR are free to choose another provider or plan at any time.”

Reliant did not directly address questions about market consolidation concerns. Vistra did not immediately respond to Texas Public Radio's inquiries.

""If we’ve got two companies at 75% (of market share) currently and (NRG and Vistra are) about to go to 80% 85% — maybe north of that who knows — then I think it begs some real questions"" said energy and climate consultant Doug Lewin.

""I mean how much competition do we have? And I want to be clear: people will say ‘Well there’s all these different (electricity providers) out there.' But NRG just bought Direct Energy so one of the two largest (electricity providers) just bought the third largest"" he added. ""So if you have Direct Energy you’re owned by NRG. If you have Green Mountain you’re owned by NRG. If you have Pennywise you’re owned by NRG. You know Vistra owns a bunch of different brands not just TXU. So is it the illusion of choice or is it actually choice?""

The commissioners gave companies until Monday at 3 p.m. to submit applications to become voluntary POLRs and they delegated the decision-making authority to Thomas Gleeson the executive director of the Public Utility Commission.

""So they left companies less than 72 hours (to apply)"" Lewin said. ""Obviously there’s some urgency to that because some of these companies will start going under quickly. But it doesn’t leave a lot of time for a lot of competition.""

Customer switchovers are expected to begin on Wednesday. At that point Morstad said the market will begin a long-term shift.

""They may end up with some of these customers for the long term"" he said. ""And that’s going to further consolidate the market and make it less competitive. And prices can go up for consumers.""

There are currently 25 fire appliances at the scene of the blaze on Holland Street Denton.

The fire originated in a three-storey warehouse building and has now spread to adjoining units.

Firefighters have laid ground monitor jets to pump water on to the fire as well as utilising three aerial appliances to tackle the blaze from above.

The incident has caused a large plume of smoke and residents are asked to keep their doors and windows closed. Evacuation procedures are in place locally.

Smoke is also affecting the M67 and a section of the motorway between junction one and junction two is closed. It is important for motorists to take extra care if travelling in areas affected by smoke.

Area Manager Stewart Forshaw who is in charge of the incident said: “Around 125 firefighters are working incredibly hard to bring this incident under control.

“The first crews on scene were met with a well-developed fire and more support was quickly mobilised to deal with the blaze.

“The incident is causing a large smoke plume that is affecting the local community and can be seen across the county. I would ask those who are affected by the smoke to keep their doors and windows closed and to avoid the area.

“Smoke is also affecting the M67 motorway and it is closed between junctions one and two. If you are travelling please take extra care.

“It is likely our firefighters will be here throughout the evening and into tomorrow as we continue to deal with this incident.”

Let's look at the specs,"The Galaxy S21 and its slightly older sibling the Galaxy S20 Fan Edition or FE are Samsung's most affordable ""new"" flagship phones. Even though the South Korean company didn't introduce any groundbreaking changes to the S21 line it received a ton of praise for slashing prices of its next-gen Galaxy S line by several hundred dollars during the pandemic allowing the base S21 to start at $700. Still the S20 FE is available for a far more affordable price of $350 raising an obvious question: Is the extra cash you'll need to pony up for the S21 worth the additional features? Ultimately that's for you to decide but here are few salient differences between the two phones that you'll want to keep in mind.

S21 has a higher-end processor and more RAM



Samsung equipped the US version of the Galaxy S21 with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 888 backed by 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage making it a bona fide powerhouse. The S20 FE comes with last year's Snapdragon 865 chipset accompanied by 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage.

S21 has a fancier rear camera module

The higher-end S21 has a 64-megapixel telephoto shooter headlining its triple rear camera setup while the S20 FE has a 12-megapixel standard lens leading its pack. Samsung also redesigned the camera housing for the S21 which accentuates the camera lenses on the phones' backs while linking them with their metal frames.

S21 loses microSD card slot for expandable storage

Although the S21 has faster processing power it lost expandable local storage joining last year's Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Z Flip foldables in ditching the microSD card slot because ""usage has markedly decreased"" according to the company. The S20 FE however gives you the option of expanding storage by up to 1TB.

No bundled charger in the S21

Unlike the S21 line the S20 FE comes with a bundled 25-watt charging brick. Samsung took a page from Apple's book when it decided to ditch the in-box charger in the name of the environment urging customers to reuse older accessories.

Today in yet another edition of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 vs. Exynos 2100 we are taking a closer look at sustained chipset performance and thermal throttling.

As usual - for context - Samsung has been releasing two versions of its premium smartphones - one with a Qualcomm chipset and another one with its own Exynos chips. So as usual we dig in to find any potential differences between the two versions. In other words is one more awesome than the other?

Chipset Samsung Exynos 2100 Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 CPU 1x 2.9 GHz – Cortex-X1 3x 2.8 GHz – Cortex-A78 4x 2.2 GHz – Cortex-A55 1x 2.84 GHz – Kryo 680 Prime (Cortex-X1) 3x 2.42 GHz – Kryo 680 Gold (Cortex-A78) 4x 1.8 GHz – Kryo 680 Silver (Cortex-A55) Manufacturing node 5nm EUV 5nm GPU Mali-G78 MP14 (14 cores) (Vulkan 1.1 OpenCL 2.0 DirectX 12) Adreno 660 (Vulkan 1.1 OpenCL 2.0 DirectX 12) Memory support LPDDR5 3200 MHz max 50 Gbit/s max size 16GB LPDDR5 3200 MHz max 50 Gbit/s max size 16GB Storage UFS 3.1 UFS 3.0 UFS 3.1 Multimedia support Max display res: 4096 x 2160 Video capture: 8K@30fps 4K@120fps; playbak: 8K@60fps Max display res: 3840 x 2160 Video capture: 8K@30fps 4K@120fps; playbak: 8K@60fps Neural processor (NPU) Triple-core NPU (up to 26 TOPS) Hexagon 780 26 TOPS Modem LTE Cat. 24 up to 3000 Mbps down 422 Mbps up; 5G SA/NSA/Sub6/mmWave up to 7.35 Gbps down 3.67 Gbps up LTE Cat. 22 up to 2500 Mbps down 316 Mbps up; 5G SA/NSA/Sub6/mmWave up to 7.5 Gbps down 3 Gbps up

After initially exploring the difference in benchmark performance between the two chips inside an otherwise identical Galaxy S21 Ultra unit we then moved on to compare overall battery endurance. In both instances the data was pretty consistent and led to the conclusion that the two S21 Ultra variants perform very similarly.

Of course this was never going to be the full story. There is always plenty of finer detail to analyze. Even so most of your really passionate comments on the matter kept circling back to the topics of thermal throttling and sustained performance in the ongoing debate on which is the superior chip. So much so in fact that we thought it merits some additional research on our part.

Just like before we took our US Snapdragon 888 S21 Ultra unit and the EU Exynos 2100 model that we used for our in-depth review and we ran the exact same set of tests on them with the exact same resolution settings - QHD and adaptive refresh rate set to Auto.



CPU Throttling test on the Exynos 2100 Galaxy S21 Ultra

CPU Throttling test

CPU Throttling test is a great app to kick things off with. A few important notes are in order though. What we are trying to achieve here is put the highest possible strain on the chipset. This is best achieved by hitting it with a lengthy synthetic multi-core load. We have looked into the matter in-depth in the past and CPU cores remain the single most significant heat source in a chipset with the GPU hardly contributing in comparison. Since sustained performance in a passively-cooled smartphone system depends pretty-much entirely on thermal management heat build-up and thermal headroom we need to torture the CPU to get any usable data. It is important to note however that this is not a realistic real-world load. Even the most challenging most demanding Android games around won't be hitting all of the CPU cores all at once. Hence the numbers on the graphs should be taken as absolute worst-case scenarios.



CPU Throttling test on the Snapdragon 888 Galaxy S21 Ultra

Let's sum-up the numbers seen during the duration of the test as seen in the screenshots above.

For the Snapdragon 888 unit we got max average and min performance figures of 250353 / 210296 / 192271 respectively which works out to 77% retained performance over the test duration of one hour.

CPU Throttling test scores MAX MIN AVERAGE RETAINED PERFORMANCE AFTER 60 MIN Galaxy S21 Ultra (Snapdragon 888) 250353 210296 192271 77% Galaxy S21 Ultra (Exynos 2100) 244339 195471 137807 56%

Conversely the Exynos 2100 managed: 244339 / 195471 / 137807 which works out to 56% retained performance. That's a substantial difference.

The Snapdragon 888 inside the Galaxy S21 Ultra maintains a higher and more stable sustained CPU performance under prolonged synthetic max load by the CPU Throttling test compared to the Exynos 2100 model.

Looking at the graphs themselves we can't help but notice that the two variants seem to take a slightly different approach to their performance curve likely down to some CPU governor tuning. The Snapdragon 888 unit appears to be trying to sustain higher average performance for as long as possible followed by a noticeable steep drop-off point. In comparison the Exynos 2100 seems to ramp-down much more-gracefully and gradually. Typically we would prefer the latter since it is less likely to cause sudden stutters. However there is also another way of looking at this - the Exynos chip can sustain its peak performance for far shorter periods and is forced to start ramping-down due to thermal constraints earlier. Also that sudden dip marked with red on the chart followed by a sudden ramp back up is the worst-case scenario for stutters.

Overall as far as the CPU Throttling test app is concerned it seems like the Exynos is struggling quite a bit more than its Snapdragon counterpart while also maintaining slightly lower scores overall. We would not read too much into the specific performance numbers in this specific case as both chips are comparable in short ""bursty"" loads. Those kinds of loads are far more likely to occur in real-life as well.

Consecutive Antutu runs

For our next set of tests we wanted something more compound so we turned to AnTuTu and elected to do 5 consecutive runs on each unit. We found that to be a good representation of the sustained behavior of each chip. Again we wouldn't fixate too much on the particular numbers since we know that the Snapdragon 888 and Exynos 2100 can score quite close to each other in AnTuTu.

A more important aspect when analyzing today's test is the amount of performance the Exynos loses over time compared to the much better-sustained curve on the Snapdragon. Qualcomm's chip even started to settle in and regain some ground for the final run. Fascinating stuff.

Finally we also wanted to do our best to stress the phones with a more GPU-centric workload both out of curiosity and as a partial sanity check to see if our ongoing theory that throttling is mostly CPU-bound still checks out.

Indeed we ended up with two much-tighter lines nearly identical in behavior. Just like in our earlier benchmark comparisons we see that at least initially 3DMark's Vulkan test appears to favor the Mali-G78 MP14 GPU inside the Exynos 2100 over the Adreno 660 inside the Snapdragon 888.

The tides then quickly turn in Qualcomm's favor as heat builds up and thermal throttling settles in. In a theoretical parallel setup where the Exynos has better CPU core thermal management we wouldn't be surprised to see the Mali-G78 MP14 with a notable or at least measurable lead instead.

As things currently stand though in a more GPU-heavy workload situation both the Snapdragon 888 and the Exynos 2100 versions of the Galaxy S21 Ultra remain very very comparable in terms of performance.

Final thoughts

What's the takeaway then? Well at the end of the day this entire debate is still a purely academic one held out of curiosity since in practical terms we still maintain that the two chips as found in the two variants of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra deliver a very comparable experience. Definitely much more so than we've seen with some of Samsung's earlier flagship generations and particularly its own chipsets. If nothing else we can probably all safely agree that the Exynos 2100 constitutes a massive and marked improvement over last year's Exynos 990.

As for declaring one chip or the other the ultimate victor here well the score seems to be in Qualcomm's favor overall. Especially if you plan on having extended gaming sessions on your Galaxy or just feel like calculating Pi in your spare time. Though once again the practical gap in performance isn't all that big and you can confidently grab whichever variant is available in your country without any fear of missing out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9TYW1zdW5nLUdhbGF4eS1Cb29rLUdvLXRvLWZlYXR1cmUtbmV3LVNuYXBkcmFnb24tOGN4LUdlbi1YLVNvQy13aXRoLTQwLWZhc3Rlci1HUFUtdGhhbi10aGUtOGN4LXdpbGwtbGF1bmNoLWFsb25nc2lkZS10aGUtR2FsYXh5LUJvb2stUHJvLWluLU1heS41MjI2MDUuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Galaxy Book Go to feature new Snapdragon 8cx Gen X SoC with 40% faster GPU than the 8cx will launch ...,"Samsung will be refreshing its Galaxy Book lineup this May. The upcoming Galaxy Book lineup will include a 11th gen Tiger Lake processor-powered Galaxy Book Pro and a new Snapdragon 8cx Gen X-powered Galaxy Book Go. The leaked slides indicate up to a 10% faster CPU and a 40% faster GPU performance for the Gen X chip over the original Snapdragon 8cx.

Samsung will likely release refreshed Galaxy Books in May this year. These include a Galaxy Book Pro powered by 11th gen Intel Tiger Lake CPUs and a Galaxy Book Go which is said to feature a new Gen X Snapdragon 8cx SoC. This information comes via WalkingCat on Twitter who has posted leaked slides detailing the specs and design of the upcoming Galaxy Books.

Samsung Galaxy Book Pro

According to WalkingCat's tweets the Galaxy Book Pro is an upgrade to the last gen Galaxy Book Ion and will offer several Tiger Lake SKUs including Core i3 Corei i5 and Core i7 configs. Like the Galaxy Book Ion the Galaxy Book Pro can also be expected to be available in 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch chassis with the latter offering the NVIDIA GeForce MX450 as a dGPU option.

The upcoming Galaxy Book Pro will continue to offer an FHD display but Samsung will be using an AMOLED panel this time instead of a QLED one. The Galaxy Book Pro will be quite portable weighing just 888 g and 1072 g for the 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch variants respectively.

The Galaxy Book Pro will be available in Silver and Denim Blue colors. Being a Tiger Lake platform Thunderbolt 4 connectivity is a given though LTE can also be optionally configured.

Samsung Galaxy Book Go

Alongside the Galaxy Book Go Samsung will also be launching a Galaxy Book Go that runs Windows on ARM. The leaked slides indicate that Samsung will be offering a newer Snapdragon 8cx SoC dubbed the Gen X version that supposedly is 10% and 40% faster than the original 8cx in CPU and GPU tests respectively. Curiously the leaked slides do not show a performance comparison with the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2.

The Gen X moniker could be a reference to the upcoming Windows 10X OS that is being designed from the ground up for mobile devices. The slides also show perceivable performance advantages compared to an Intel Core i5-1035G4.

The Galaxy Book Go will feature a 14-inch FHD display and will be available in two configs:

Snapdragon 7c with 4 GB LPDDR4x RAM and 128 GB UFS storage

Snapdragon 8cx Gen X with 8 GB LPDDR4x RAM and 256 GB UFS storage

Both the Galaxy Book Pro and the Galaxy Book Go are expected to launch in May 2021 which is when we will get to know more information about pricing and availability.

Apart from the new Galaxy Books Samsung will also be launching the new Galaxy Tab S7 Lite and Tab A7 Lite Android tablets in June.

There's no Wi-Fi 6 here and 2.4 GHz performance is lackluster.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

Routers have often been an afterthought of a gaming setup. But these days folks are paying more attention to this critical piece of networking hardware. After all all your gaming traffic passes through this box so having it up to standards is important. With all the latest features such as Wi-Fi 6 (and now 6E) Beamforming and the latest in network security premium router prices have headed significantly north for the last several years approaching the price of a mainstream laptop in plenty of cases.

But flying in the face of fancy new features and premium price points is the TP-Link Archer A7. As Amazon's best-selling router with a 4.5-star rating across over 38000 reviews clearly it's making plenty of customers happy. So we wanted to put it through its paces in our gaming testing to see how it performs and use it as our baseline for gaming router testing going forward.

In a world of fancy muscle cars the Archer A7 shows up like a Toyota Corolla with the essential features plus a little extra. We go hands-on to see what a budget router that costs around $50 can do. Is dropping the router budget this far a good way to stretch your gaming dollar or should you look to spend more on a higher-end alternative?

Design

The Archer A7 sports a fairly pedestrian design consisting of a horizontally oriented box with three spindly external antennas. Typical of mainstream electronics it has a gloss-black plastic exterior with two grooves that add some visual interest along the top of the body of the router. A series of green LED’s provide status info on such aspects of power internet connections to the Ethernet ports and if the wireless signal is active. Finally the company logo is featured prominently on the top with an AC1750 badge on the right front both done tastefully in a light gray.

The back of the Archer A7 continues the simple but functional theme. This includes between the antenna attachment points a physical power button a USB port a WAN port and four Ethernet ports and finally a WPS switch. While there's nothing that really stands out here all the essentials are covered.

Overall the router is somewhat compact although it still takes up more space than a router with a vertical design. The dimensions are 9.57 x 6.32 x 1.28 inches (243 × 160.6 × 32.5 mm).

Specifications

The Archer A7 is a dual-band router in that it can send out simultaneous 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signals. It conforms to the AC1750 standard by offering 2.4 GHz speeds up to 450 Mbps and 5 GHz speeds of 1300 Mbps. If that seems a little slower than some others this is not your imagination. This router is on the now previous generation of Wi-Fi 802.11ac while most higher-end modern networking gear uses 802.11ax with the latest announcements for networking gear Wi-Fi 6E. So this Archer A7 is some rows back from the cutting edge although it also costs a fraction of the price of most AX gaming routers.

There are five wired Ethernet ports which are all Gigabit speed: one WAN and the remaining four LAN. There is also a single USB 2.0 port for use as an FTP or media server. Again pricier routers often have USB 3.0 ports but a USB 2.0 port will suffice for most file transfers given the router's limited speed.

The specs of the hardware are pretty basic as well. This includes a Qualcomm Atheros QCA9563 with an integrated 750-MHz processor. The storage is also provisioned at the basic level at 128MB of RAM and 16MB of flash storage.

Setup and Features

Setup was done via the router’s website (alternately you can use the company's Tether app) which proceeded smoothly in just a few minutes. The Archer A7 can be used as either a router an access point or with other TP-Link OneMesh products for a whole-house mesh setup.

While it covers all the basics the overall feature set of the Archer A7 is fairly pedestrian. This includes the limitation that the latest wireless encryption standard WPA3 is not supported. There is also no support for beamforming. However the Archer A7 does have QoS although it does not have granular settings to prioritize different types of traffic. There is also support for running a VPN server.

Security

The Archer A7 falls a bit short in the security area with no anti-malware function to keep your network free of viruses. However it does have the essentials that a router needs with a firewall and DoS protection that can be adjusted among three levels.

For families with children the Archer A7 does have some basic Parental Controls with options for time limits and to restrict devices.

Performance

We put the Archer A7 through our bandwidth test using NetPerf software to quantitate throughput. On the 2.4 GHz frequency the throughput on our close test was 92 Mbps which reduced to 51 Mbps as we moved a floor about 30 feet away which is slower than some higher-end routers we've tested. The 5 GHz test had a stronger performance at the close distance at 535 Mbps though it also dropped considerably at the longer distance to a fairly unexceptional 122 Mbps. If you need better performance at long distances from the router stepping up to a Wi-Fi 6 router would be a good idea.

We next put the Archer A7 through our network congestion testing suite. Our baseline wired test as indicated in Ethernet shows a solid FPS score of 112.3 with no Pingplotter spikes and a decent latency of 71 millisecs in our Overwatch game. As we added in the network congestion with the ten 8K videos we see the FPS drop to a still playable 95.2 but with a high 43.8% dropped frame rate with the router’s QoS set to off. Enabling QoS increased the FPS to 102.4 while reducing the dropped frames on the streamed videos to 32.4% demonstrating the value of the Archer A7’s QoS.

Connecting to the Archer A7 via the 2.4 GHz with QoS enabled yielded unimpressive results with the FPS at 87.5 the 8K videos with a 36.8% dropped frame rate and the Overwatch game latency increased to 284 millisecs. Things fared better when connected via 5 GHz with a 115.5 FPS seen without any background video streaming which dropped to 45.1 when we added in the videos and left QoS off which increased back to 96.2 FPS with the QoS enabled. However we measured higher gaming latencies than when wired such as 295 millisecs with the network congested and QoS enabled. As is often the case a wired connection is the superior route for fast-paced gameplay.

Pricing and Bottom Line

The main advantage of the Archer A7 AC1750 is the price. The MSRP is $59.99 and we found pricing that was even discounted a few dollars off of that at the major retailers which is certainly affordable. The performance we measured while not class leading is quite respectable given the price. This makes it ideal for folks who care more about price than future proofing or cutting-edge features. At this price it's also a good option to keep around as a backup so you don't have to quickly run to the store and buy something expensive if your main router suddenly dies.

The Archer A7 is a solid choice with advantages of decent 5 GHz throughput high FPS scores on wired congestion and most of all price. Weaknesses include the lack of security features (unsurprising at this price) the weak 2.4 GHz throughput and 802.11ac only which limits support to WPA2 only for wireless encryption and means modern and future 802.11ax devices won't be able to access your network at their maximum speed.That said those looking for a budget router or an affordable backup would be well served by the Archer A7 AC1750.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ieXBhc3MtbWVkaWF0ZWstc3AtZmxhc2gtdG9vbC1hdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbi1yZXF1aXJlbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's now easy to bypass MediaTek's SP Flash Tool authentication,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ieXBhc3MtbWVkaWF0ZWstc3AtZmxhc2gtdG9vbC1hdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbi1yZXF1aXJlbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Jamel Dean a Cocoa High graduate went on to play football for Auburn before being drafted by Tampa Bay in 2019. His family friends and former coaches spoke about how the ""humble"" kid from Cocoa used a positive mindset to reach the pinnacle of the game.

""I appreciate the support y'all gave me in the Super Bowl. I felt the love and I just love the city of Cocoa"" Dean a 24-year-old Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive back said to cheers of adulation from the crowd Saturday. ""This is really an honor.""

The Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa in Super Bowl LV on Feb. 7.

The path from Cocoa to the Super Bowl was not always an easy one as Jamel Dean fought through knee injuries and setbacks after high school. When he was first scouted by a youth coach at 7 years old his mother wasn't sure he'd be able to play.

""That's fine but I don't know how he'll get there because I work two jobs"" she told the youth coach. The coach with a van full of other children came to pick Dean up for every practice.

Soon it was discovered that Dean was not only the fastest kid on the team but also had the most desire to improve and maximize his potential.

""The word that everybody used is humble"" said former Cocoa Tigers coach John Wilkinson. ""We always talk about young men who come into our program. To play at Cocoa High School you have to have athletic ability but he was a true student.""

Graduating with a 3.8 GPA from high school and maintaining a 3.5 GPA in college was a testament to the mindset and work ethic that Wilkinson said took Dean to the top.

""I did not play about those grades"" said his mother Yolanda Kimbrough.

Kimbrough fought through tears and she described how hard her son battled not only to succeed at his sport but also to maintain good grades and persevere through surgeries and injuries.

She drove out to see him at college to ensure he got the medical treatment he needed to continue playing football.

Cocoa city officials also spoke highly of Dean as they awarded the key to the city to him Saturday.

""The young man earned a Super Bowl ring... and that's a big statement for many people in Cocoa on the aspirations you can have in this city and how far you can take your vision"" said City Councilman LaVander Hearn.

""He is a young man who has defied all odds. I'm very proud of that young man"" said Mayor Mike Blake.

Former Cocoa High Tigers Coach Wilkinson had among the strongest words to describe not just Dean's playing ability but his character as well.

""He did the right thing all the time staying out of trouble and believing in himself"" Wilkinson said. ""I want my son to grow up to be like Jamel Dean. He is without a doubt the face of the city.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV3cmVzdGxpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dyZXN0bGVtYW5pYS0zNy11cGRhdGUtd3dlLWlzLXN0aWxsLWhvcGluZy1mb3ItYW4tYXVkaWVuY2XSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ld3Jlc3RsaW5nbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy93cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtMzctdXBkYXRlLXd3ZS1pcy1zdGlsbC1ob3BpbmctZm9yLWFuLWF1ZGllbmNlL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WrestleMania 37 Update: WWE Is Still Hoping For An Audience,"WWE is still hoping for a big crowd to attend WrestleMania 37.

Church performed a unique arrangement of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" with R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan before the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers faced off at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Fla. and during an in-depth interview at the 2021 Country Radio Seminar on Friday (Feb. 19) Bryan says he texted Church immediately after his performance ended.

""I was like 'Dude I know you're glad it's over. Congrats'"" Bryan recalls. ""And he sent me one word: 'Stressful.'""

Bryan can readily relate to that stress. He gave an a cappella rendition of the national anthem at NRG Stadium in Houston Texas to help kick off a Super Bowl game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons in 2017 and he was especially nervous because he had earned widespread criticism after a poorly received performance of the anthem at the MLB All-Star Game in 2012. That performance caused a giant controversy online when fans criticized the singer for reading the lyrics to the anthem off his hand while he sang.

He didn't let that previous experience turn him aside however.

""I said you know I didn't move to Nashville and go through all this to puss out on those kind of moments"" Bryan reflects. ""This is a time where you've gotta do it you've gotta own it you've gotta own what you are and no matter how much moxie or swagger you've got you've gotta walk your butt out there and sing the anthem ... and move on from your past.""

Church also admitted to nerves prior to his performance with Sullivan saying he had long shied away from singing the anthem because it's such a daunting vocal challenge.

""It's so hard"" he told Apple Music Country's Today’s Country Radio With Kelleigh Bannen. ""My first response was nuh-uh ... I can't. I'm a stylist not a vocalist.""

He changed his mind once he heard the arrangement from producer Adam Blackstone who hand-picked Church and Sullivan for the performance.

""I thought 'That's cool; that sounds like me' and then I heard her and I'm not missing a chance to sing with her"" Church said. ""And that was it. Once I heard her voice I said 'Okay I'm in.'""

If you’re just a PC owner wanting to know where to buy the Nvidia RTX 3080 you’re in for some drawn-out disappointment.

However there’s now cause for hope that such overwhelming demand can at least be eased. Nvidia itself has a two-pronged plan to get currency miners off the RTX 30-series’ case: first by intentionally hamstringing the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 as a potential mining tool. And secondly by offering a brand new range of processors that can perform a graphics card’s role in mining rigs without the need to buy up all of the gaming GPU stock of course.

The Nvidia blog details this new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line as well as the plan for the RTX 3060 when it launches later this month.

Firstly the RTX 3060’s software drivers will cut the card's Ethereum “hash rate” in half. This will essentially make it much slower at solving the complex mathematical problems that digital currency mining requires making the RTX 3060 less appealing to serious miners without affecting gaming performance.

That’s the stick but the CMP line is the carrot. These GPUs will be built from the ground up for efficient mining and not just like how some gaming graphics cards have a barely distinct “Mining Edition.” CMP cards will be more power-efficient and come without display outputs which mining rigs don’t use to enable better airflow.

In other words Nvidia is shooing miners away from the RTX 30-series family while also providing a superior alternative. The blog post says production of the CMP range won’t affect the RTX line’s already glacial supply speed too.

Nvidia RTX 30-series stock disaster: Mining madness

While this is only addressing one factor in the much wider problem of non-availability it’s clear that Nvidia is finally doing something to make RTX 30-series cards (or at least the RTX 3060) easier for ordinary consumers to get.

As frustrating as it might be to see photos of mining rigs piled high with Nvidia’s latest cards or even GeForce RTX-powered laptops a solely punitive approach to mining wouldn’t work. If there’s money to be made people will do it. And even if the RTX 3060 will suck as a mining card anyone desperate enough will still try it if there’s no alternative. Nvidia has therefore been wise in providing one.

It’s certainly a lot more than other powerful parties have done. The anti-reseller defenses put in place by retailers have proven woefully inadequate. Modern bots — the scripts resellers use to instantly buy stock the moment it goes online — are able to get past captchas and order limits with ease.

Board partners have done even less to make sure their graphics cards end up in the hands of regular consumers. Zotac even posted (then hastily deleted) an approving tweet showing someone’s RTX 30-series mining rig; if you can’t understand why that’s distasteful imagine a Victorian workhouse owner hanging a framed photo of roast chicken in front of all the hungry urchins.

Nvidia RTX 30-series stock disaster: More to be done

(Image credit: Nvidia)

Still there’s a long way to go. Nvidia is giving the RTX 3060 a fighting chance but ultimately it’s only dulling the appeal to a subset of miners. There’s nothing to dissuade the circling resellers. And even some conventional retailers are banking on demand being high enough to raise their RTX 3060 prices ahead of launch.

Nvidia itself was rightly criticized for the disastrous RTX 3070 RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 launch last year after which the company admitted ill-preparedness for “truly unprecedented” demand.

Then there’s the supply issue. RTX 30-series production is slow apparently due to a combination of raw materials shortages and the low yields of the 7-nanometer Samsung chips it uses. It’s extremely unlikely that stock levels will return to something approaching normalcy until Nvidia can actually produce enough cards to meet demand. This could take months even if the CMP range doesn’t slow it down further.

However the RTX 3060 launch goes Nvidia obviously has a lot more to do to end this graphics card shortage. But after months of next to nothing it’s finally moving in the right direction — and all it took was a couple of good ideas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZhYS10by1pc3N1ZS1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktb3JkZXItcmVxdWlyaW5nLWltbWVkaWF0ZS1vci1zdGVwcGVkLXVwLWluc3BlY3Rpb25zLW9mLWJvZWluZy03NzdzLXdpdGgtY2VydGFpbi1wcmF0dC13aGl0bmV5LXB3NDAwMC1lbmdpbmVz0gGtAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZmFhLXRvLWlzc3VlLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1vcmRlci1yZXF1aXJpbmctaW1tZWRpYXRlLW9yLXN0ZXBwZWQtdXAtaW5zcGVjdGlvbnMtb2YtYm9laW5nLTc3N3Mtd2l0aC1jZXJ0YWluLXByYXR0LXdoaXRuZXktcHc0MDAwLWVuZ2luZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAA demands emergency inspection of select Boeing 777s after midair explosion ripped engine into pieces,"Federal Aviation Administration administrator Steve Dickson has ordered the agency's aviation safety experts to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring ""immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines.""

""This will likely mean that some airplanes will be removed from service"" Dickson said in a statement posted to Twitter.

According to the FAA aviation safety experts are meeting into the evening with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing to finalize the details of the order and any accompanying service bulletins in order to ensure that the appropriate airplanes are included. Exact details of the inspection will be specified in the emergency order.

Dickson added that the agency is ""working closely with other civil aviation authorities to make this information available to affected operators in their jurisdictions.”

UNITED FLIGHT'S ENGINE CATCHES FIRE AFTER DENVER TAKEOFF RETURNS TO AIRPORT SAFELY

The move comes in response to United Airlines flight 328 which experienced an engine failure after taking off from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The airplane landed safely after dropping debris over northern Colorado officials said.

The Boeing 777 was heading from Denver to Honolulu with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard when its right engine failed and erupted in flames. The plane quickly lost altitude and dropped huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass onto the neighborhoods below. Authorities said no injuries were reported aboard the plane or on the ground where debris fell.

""We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident"" Dickson said. ""Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Boeing said in a statement that it is ""actively monitoring recent events related to United Airlines Flight 328"" and that while an investigation into the incident by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway it recommends ""suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines until the FAA identifies the appropriate inspection protocol.""

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a Sunday evening investigation update that an intitial examination indicated that the airplane sustained minor damage most of which was ""confined to the number 2 engine.""

Investigators noted that the inlet a duct which is required to ensure smooth airflow into the engine and a cowling the removable metal covering that houses the engine were separated from the engine. In addition two fan blades were fractured while the remainder of the blades exhibited damage to their tips and leading edges.

The NTSB added that investigators continue to examine the engine airplane and the photographs and video taken by passengers aboard United flight 328 and that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were transported to the agency's laboratory in Washington where each will be downloaded and analyzed.

According to the most recent registry data airlines in only three countries operate airplanes with the affected engines: the United States Japan and South Korea. United Airlines the only U.S. operator with this type of engine in its fleet said it would ground the affected planes immediately.

""Starting immediately and out of an abundance of caution we are voluntarily and temporarily removing 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from our schedule. Since yesterday we’ve been in touch with regulators at the NTSB and FAA and will continue to work closely with them to determine any additional steps that are needed to ensure these aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards and can return to service"" a United spokesperson told FOX Business in a statement. ""As we swap out aircraft we expect only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.”

With the massively rising popularity of cryptocurrencies and their integration into everyday life a messaging platform that caters to the DeFi audience has become a need of the hour. We now see many applications that support the transfer of fiat money but how about crypto? iMe Messenger bridges this gap and aids the crypto industry in its unprecedented growth through a user-friendly platform where crypto traders investors and enthusiasts can efficiently communicate and engage in financial transactions.

What is iMe?

iMe is an intuitive messaging platform developed on the Telegram open source. It features all the functions of Telegram along with some exciting new tools and settings like neurobots a built-in google translator crypto wallets a functional cloud with albums and advanced folder facilities.

The central idea behind the project is the empowerment of Telegram users through the capabilities of DeFi. It facilitates seamless business and personal communication in one of the most secure ecosystems available today.

iMe Wallet and Fiat Purchase of Crypto

iMe Wallet is integrated with the Ethereum platform to take the use of decentralized financial instruments to the next level. By enhancing the competence of a messaging application with cryptocurrency transactions iMe accelerates the mass adoption of DeFi in a way no other venture has attempted. Although the version with the option to send ETH was updated just a few weeks ago iMe Wallet has 10k active Ethereum wallets in use currently.

One of the defining features of iMe would be crypto transactions using fiat bank cards. To support this iMe has partnered with Simplex a licensed financial institution in the crypto world that hosts a diverse range of payment options. The alliance extends many functions and facilities on Simplex to the iMe ecosystem. Telegram users can access the highly acclaimed Atomic Wallet and MyEtherWallet used on the Simplex platform now from iMe.

Lime Token

Lime token is the ERC-777 utility token on iMe. Although it was first designed to connect AiCoin - the virtual coin on the iMe ecosystem - to the decentralized world its scope has widened over time.

Lime tokens will be available for purchase on SIMPLEX in the near future and through Uniswap in the next update. The number of cryptocurrencies supported via Simplex will be increased over time.

Story continues

High-End Security

iMe Wallet has a separate existence from iMe messenger giving you full control over your keys and funds. You will encrypt your wallet and will be asked to enter your password every time you open the wallet. However iMe Wallet will enable a PIN code that encrypts the password for added convenience. In this case too only the device will have access to the password no servers are involved.

When it comes to the messenger all data exchanged like names phone numbers and conversations are stored on Telegram's servers. The platform has no access to them as it will violate the terms of Telegram's open-source code use. This way iMe Messenger guarantees 100% privacy to users.

The Road Ahead

Currently iMe supports the storage purchase and exchange of ETH. In the future more exciting DeFi features will be rolled out like the transfer of crypto coins to Telegram users through a user-friendly interface addition of USDT Uniswap integration Bitcoin integration and Lime token - Simplex integration with an aim to enhance the liquidity and usability of crypto coins.

Starting March 8 homeowners in Arvada will be asked to choose from three sizes of trash cans with the price of service going up with the volume of the receptacle. It’s an incentive-based approach — already in use in several Colorado communities — designed to get people to throw away less and help cities better meet sustainability goals.

It sounds good on paper but there’s a catch: For people who decline to transition Arvada will impose a mandatory $5.13 monthly “minimum service” fee. Non-payment could result in a lien being placed on a homeowner’s property.

There’s a growing contingent of Arvadans who think the city is sticking its nose where it shouldn’t. One person on a city message board likened the service fee to extortion.

“We are opposed to a city-mandated monopoly for trash service in Arvada and we’re asking people to exercise their right of choice and opt out” said Jonah Hearne a 20-year resident who next month plans to go door to door with dozens of like-minded citizens urging neighbors to reject the new program.

For Tom D’Agostino a three-year Arvada resident who is happy with the service he gets from his contracted hauler Waste Connections the city’s levy is a no-go.

“I’m not going to pay for something that I’m not going to use” he said.

City officials say the opt-out fee which is less than what other communities with similar programs charge is necessary to make the program feasible on a citywide basis. And residents will still get waste services — bulky item and leaf and yard waste drop-off events — even if they stay with their current hauler.

Colorado’s seen this fight play out in several Denver suburbs. Next door to Arvada Westminster residents crowded council chambers in 2017 to denounce the city’s plan to implement a centralized trash collection system.

Two years later voters in Lakewood shot down a ballot measure that would have authorized the city to manage garbage pickup there. Arvada itself looked at consolidating trash service a decade ago before tabling the idea in the face of opposition.

The Arvada City Council passed the current plan in June and it is scheduled to start July 5.

Kate Bailey a policy and research director for Boulder-based Eco-Cycle Inc. consulted with Arvada on its new trash collection plan. She said the hubbub over the issue might seem puzzling to much of the rest of the U.S. where municipal trash service is more common.

“People from the rest of the country look at us like we’re nuts” she said. “This makes a lot of sense and yet it’s oddly political.”

Incentive to recycle

Arvada will be taking a single-hauler approach to garbage collection contracting with Republic Services for citywide service in contrast to the nine different haulers that currently provide residential pickup service in the city.

The city will also use the pay-as-you-throw model which is already in place in several Front Range communities including Lafayette Louisville Golden and Sheridan. Arvada would be the state’s largest city to embrace it.

The principle is straightforward: The more you toss the more you pay. In Arvada a 95-gallon trash cart will cost $19.76 a month a 65-gallon cart $15.63 a month and a 35-gallon cart — which can hold three to four kitchen-sized bags — will cost $11.50 a month.

Every household in the program gets a 95-gallon recycling bin at no charge which Bailey says will goose recycling levels. The proof is in the data she added.

According to Eco-Cycle the top recycling communities on the Front Range have citywide programs that automatically provide bins — and communities using a pay-as-you-throw approach stand out Bailey said.

Loveland which charges as little as $3.25 a month for a 17-gallon trash bin is at the top of the list with a 60% recycling rate. Louisville and Lafayette are at 44% and 36% respectively. Arvada’s recycling rate is below 15% according to past surveys of haulers Bailey said.

Colorado’s recycling rate was less than half the national average in 2019 according to a study released last fall.

“Pay-as-you-throw does have a behavior modification element to it much like tiered pricing for water use helps to incentivize water conservation” Bailey said.

A 2018 study by the University of New Hampshire found among 34 towns that used the pay-as-you-throw model waste disposal rates dropped between 42% and 54% according to reporting from The Associated Press. Another study in neighboring Maine found that cities with the incentive-based system generated approximately 44% less trash per capita than communities without the program.

In Sheridan a working-class suburb south of Denver City Manager Devin Granbery said the city’s pay-as-you-throw program has brought noticeable benefits since it launched in 2014.

“Recycling has gone from virtually zero to 75% of our residents participating in curbside recycling with a diversion rate of 15%” he said.

The system also helps cut down on street maintenance Louisville Public Works Director Kurt Kowar said. The Boulder County city has had a pay-as-you-throw garbage collection program in place since 2010.

“Trucks have a huge impact when turning and areas such as cul-de-sacs get torn up over time” Kowar said. “In general a trash truck equals 1000 cars per day on the road.”

That’s important to Rachael Smallwood who moved to Arvada from North Dakota five years ago. She’s one of dozens of city residents who have praised the program online.

“It was a shock that there were so many ginormous trucks putting out all that pollution” she said. “That’s important to me as our climate crisis gets worse.”

Smallwood said she barely fills a third of her trash can per week and will be opting for the smallest container Arvada offers giving her a huge discount off of the $30 she pays monthly now.

“Put it on a ballot”

But for opponents of Arvada’s single-hauler trash system they’re not just bothered by what they perceive as a heavy-handed approach to garbage collection. They say the means by which the new program was approved — a slender 4-3 margin by the City Council in the middle of a pandemic rather than a vote of the people — is problematic.

“If you all of a sudden change the relationship between the city and the citizens — then put it on a ballot” Hearne said. “The city is collecting money that a lot of people consider a tax and giving it to a private company.”

Last year’s vote so incensed some Arvada residents that they launched an effort to recall the four council members who voted for it. The recall never made it to the ballot.

Mayor Marc Williams who opposed the single-hauler contract also felt the issue should have gone to the voters. But he said “the council has spoken.”

“I knew this would be as contentious as it was 10 years ago” Williams said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcmVsaWVmd2ViLmludC9yZXBvcnQvYnVydW5kaS9kZW1vY3JhdGljLXJlcHVibGljLWNvbmdvLXJlZ2lvbmFsLXJlZnVnZWUtcmVzcG9uc2UtcGxhbi0yMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democratic Republic of the Congo Regional Refugee Response Plan 2021 - Burundi,"$17750000 FUNDING REQUIRED

IOM VISION

IOM seeks to contribute to the efforts of governments and national inter-agency responses coordinated by UNHCR to ensure an overarching vision and coherent engagement for Congolese refugees by bridging the nexus between humanitarian interventions and assistance with a longer-term perspective. IOM's planned interventions will be multi-sectoral in nature responding to the inter-agency analysis of needs and priorities of target beneficiaries and leveraging IOM's operational presence and technical expertise.

CONTEXT ANALYSIS

Regional: The humanitarian situation in the region remains highly complex illustrated by various groups of internally displaced persons (IDPs) as well as Congolese refugees being hosted in neighbouring countries. Although most of the countries hosting Congolese refugees have maintained open borders for those seeking refuge and international protection many refugees face restrictions on their freedom of movement their right to work regarding their housing land and property rights as well as their access to education healthcare and justice. The existing refugee settlements and camps in many host countries are at capacity and available basic services are stretched to their limits. At the same time there is a need to accommodate a growing Congolese refugee population and organize the relocation to safe places away from border areas and establish new settlements. There have also been increasing incidents of discrimination and xenophobia in some of the host countries. Given their situation of displacement refugees are especially vulnerable in particular women children and other persons with specific needs or disabilities. There is also concern that increased needs in the Southern and Great Lakes regions in Africa and amid the current COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on the ability and willingness of countries to welcome refugees.

Angola has been a destination country for refugees and asylum seekers from different countries with almost 24000 coming from DRC. In 2019 and 2020 more than 14000 refugees opted to return to their home countries spontaneously while 2925 refugees returned through an organized process. However Angola continues to host a high number of refugees who are awaiting documentation and legalization while other groups such as those from Kasai-region who are based in Lovua settlement in Lunda Norte await their return as soon conditions allow.

Burundi: Burundi a small but densely populated country with a population of around eight million shares its western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It currently hosts over 80000‌ registered urban and camp-based refugees from the DRC verified by UNHCR’s. Biometric Information Management System. The number of refugees has steadily increased since 2004 due to recurring violent conflict in the DRC.

Rwanda: While refugees enjoy a generally favourable protection environment in Rwanda poor conditions of refugees in camps and lack of livelihood opportunities has resulted in high dependency of refugees on humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs. By the end of September 2020 only 60% of refugees had adequate shelter. Access to water remains below standards in the camps livelihood opportunities are limited and refugees have been heavily affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Uganda: Despite Uganda’s favourable protection environment refugees are faced with numerous protection challenges due to the magnitude of displacement and growing vulnerabilities compounded by diminishing resources and strained social services in districts where refugees are hosted. Among the most vulnerable populations are unaccompanied and separated children women adolescents older persons at risk persons with disabilities and serious medical conditions and persons suffering from distress. The management of the international border during humanitarian crises requires concerted efforts in light of the higher risks of further spread of diseases and due to the number of unofficial and uncontrolled border crossing points. IOM engagement in reinforcing cross-border coordination interagency collaborationand data management and sharing at the local district and national level needs to be sustained and continued to ensure more efficient and targeted responses.

United Republic of Tanzania: The closure of refugee reception and transit centres across northwestern Tanzania has made access to territory more difficult. Administrative instructions restricting refugees’ movement inside and outside the camps have also severely limited refugees’ coping mechanisms while at the same time the high rejection rate of refugee claims exposes many asylum-seekers to a variety of protection risks in the context of a possible influx of DRC refugees also in 2021.

Zambia: Zambia will be undertaking national elections in 2021 and as experienced elsewhere during national elections the election season may be associated with xenophobic tendencies towards migrants and refugees. Any political instability may negatively shrink the operating and humanitarian environment thereby affecting the provision of services to refugees and migrants. Migrants and refugees may easily be targeted or misrepresented in terms of political persuasion and it is therefore important to ensure that they are not left behind as the country goes through this phase. As more refugees arrive more cases of large single-headed households with children elderly and survivors of gender- based violence (GBV) are settling in the country requiring more comprehensive social protection.",,,,,,,,,

All without leaving the comfort of their own homes.

That is the new normal for a growing number of workers at PwC which is buying thousands of virtual reality headsets to help battle Zoom fatigue and level the playing field for employees barred from entering the same room during the Covid outbreak.

It is latest example of how firms are adapting to remote working after the Covid-19 epidemic cancelled international client meetings and consigned white-collar workers to their kitchen tables. A recent poll by recruiter Robert Half found that 89% of businesses expect hybrid working – split between home and office – to become permanent after the pandemic prompting investment in new technology and offices that can offer more to staff than a desk and a wifi signal.

“What’s interesting is you’ve had a bunch of technologies around to enable remote working for quite a while” Nick South a partner and expert in the future of work at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said. “It took this mass shift to remote work in general for firms to say ‘Oh actually let’s try and apply it at scale’.”

PwC first piloted the use of VR headsets in the UK in 2017 but after the pandemic forced its 22000 staff to work from home it accelerated hybrid working plans. Its UK operation is already running two to three team meetings via VR each week. Over the next 18 months it is spending £75m to redesign offices with cafe-style meeting areas and equip staff with new tech. That will include higher grade microphones video meeting screens and doubling its own cache of VR headsets to 400 by the end of the year to help remove the disadvantage of logging in from home.

“If you’re the only person on [Google] Hangouts you’re guaranteed new elements of a ‘fear of missing out’” PwC UK’s chief executive Kevin Ellis said. “Therefore it’s really important that our meeting rooms are able to level the playing field.”

One PwC staffer recalled leading a presentation for a furniture company through its VR headsets. Held in the grand hall of a virtual conference centre participants were able to conjure furniture designs out of thin air and allow clients to view them in real time.

“It’s really quite strange but very interesting” Ellis said adding that he hopes new tech will help cut down on international travel post-pandemic and improve work-life balance by reducing commuting.

BCG’s own research found that 86% of UK workers claimed to have benefited from remote working saying they were less distracted and had a better work-life balance.

However 79% also experienced negative impacts including anxiety loneliness and increasingly blurred boundaries between home and work. There is also a risk that staff – especially those under 35 – feel less visible to bosses and miss out on informal training by being around their peers and seniors along the way. “The thing that people have really struggled with is on-the-job learning and apprenticeship which you do get by being side-by-side and face-to-face with colleagues” South said.

Nicholas Bloom British economist at Stanford University has been researching the effects of home working for years before the pandemic hit. He strongly advises that companies offer remote working at least one or two days a week. His own surveys found that staff preferred the arrangement and would probably demand 8% higher pay if refused. They were also more productive which was good for the corporate bottom line.

However Bloom advises against letting staff ditch the office entirely.

Working from home is like beer or wine – it is great in moderation but is not so great in excess. One to three days a week seems to be the sweet spot. A few firms are planning five days a week post-pandemic but I think that is risky and problematic. It is hard to innovate remotely it is hard to maintain company culture and it can make employees feel lonely and isolated.”

Some firms such as digital bank Revolut are now overhauling offices to push more of its staff together after the Covid pandemic recedes.

The fintech firm is redesigning all 23 of its global sites – including its headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf – by halving the number of individual desks from about 2800 to roughly 1400 over the next few years. It will instead dedicate 70% of office space for meeting rooms and group seating while reserving some “quiet zones” for staff.

While this will help reduce square footage in some offices Revolut said it was not a cost-cutting exercise and would only represent “marginal savings”.

“In most cases people are not primarily looking at [hybrid working arrangements] from a cost point of view. They’re fundamentally thinking ‘How do we as an organisation want to work in the future’?” South said.

Earlier this month the 335-year-old insurance market Lloyd’s of London launched a consultation into how its iconic Grade I-listed building at 1 Lime Street will be used after the pandemic.

The market – which hosted 6000 of its 45000 workers brokers and underwriters on any given day before Covid – is asking how members plan to use spaces that are usually booked for meetings training and events as well as its cafe and wellness centre (reserved for yoga meditation and simple medical issues) given hybrid-working plans and the “career aspirations” of their members.

Lloyd’s is also reviewing the “future purpose and role” of its physical underwriting room which has been off limits for most of the pandemic and temporarily replaced with a digital version that helped shift more of its complex insurance negotiations online last year.

Firms that fail to consider hybrid working models not only risk losing talented workers to more progressive employers but are also cutting themselves off from a more diverse pool of staff who might – for example – live outside London but would consider commuting twice a week.

“The expectations are shifting quite fast and the examples of people doing things differently are appearing all the time. So actually [businesses] need to start doing their thinking now” South said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZWVsY2l0eXVuZGVyZ3JvdW5kLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL3BsYXlzLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLWRlcnJpY2staGVucnktcnVucy1pbnRvLWEtYnJpY2std2FsbC1uYW1lZC1yb2JlcnQtc3BpbGxhbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plays of the Year: Derrick Henry runs into a brick wall named Robert Spillane,"Plays of the Year: Derrick Henry runs into a brick wall named Robert Spillane

Steel City Underground presents “Plays of the Year” featuring the top runs catches hits and everything else in-between from the Pittsburgh Steelers 2020 season.

In a game highlighted by COVID-19 protocols which moved the originally scheduled date from Week 4 back to Week 7 the 5-0 Pittsburgh Steelers would travel to take on the equally unbeaten 5-0 Tennessee Titans.

The Steelers offense shined in the first half jumping out to a 24-7 lead but it was the defense that would shine against the Titans comeback bid in the second half. A single play late in the game could not have summed up this team’s defensive mentality more than stopping the league’s strongest running back on the goal line.

On 3rd-and-1 and on Pittsburgh’s doorstep to score the Titans tried to run into the teeth of the Steelers defense as Robert Spillane and T.J. Watt met Derrick Henry head-on to make a massive collision behind the line of scrimmage.

Both backers slam Henry down with a tremendous pop: Spillane smacked him so hard that he would exit on the sideline to check on his shoulder.

The Steelers were without a doubt one of the most physical defenses in the league. Even in the absence of Devin Bush Robert Spillane was a fierce player and contributor

While the second half made many of us grab the nitroglycerin pills to prevent us from having heart attacks the Steelers were gifted a break by the football gods that sealed the deal at the end of the game.

The Steelers would remain the only undefeated team in the AFC after a long and hard-fought 27-24 victory over the Titans.

Executive Overview

Industrial companies increasingly compete in markets affected by globalization and rapid technology advancements. To survive and thrive in these markets these companies are attempting to leverage massive amounts of data.

Using interconnected equipment devices and systems organizations can collect a wealth of real-time data about their operations. Historic data collected and unused often for decades can also be mined for new value. Massive amounts of unstructured data such as video audio work logs manuals paper work order documents can be integrated into analytics.

Clearly analytics are quickly evolving beyond their business intelligence roots. New predictive analytics solutions are available including those using machine learning and other cognitive approaches. Many companies are still trying to understand how to best employ these advanced types of analytics and waiting to see the results that these types of solutions can provide.

Yet even as companies wrestle with how to implement and leverage predictive solutions a new layer of the analytics “onion” is already being peeled—prescriptive analytics. While predictive analytics determine the probability that something will happen prescriptive analytics provide guidance as to what should be done in response and can often automate the outcome.

Companies desire to layer prescriptive analysis on top of predictive methods. The idea is to maximize the use of data to predict what might occur and then act upon that prediction to deliver the optimized outcome for the business. The beneficial implications of employing this approach to decision making could transform how business is done.

This report addresses the uncertainty around prescriptive analytics clarifying the different modes and how they work. The report outlines the market use of these modes clarifying level of complexity and current adoption. It will provide strategies intended to help you understand how to think about prescriptive analytics within the context of your business.

Market Lacks Clarity

We are having many discussions with buyers looking for clarity on how to make purchasing decisions for advanced analytics including both predictive and prescriptive methods. Many are confused and even skeptical and for good reason. The market lacks clarity. Reasons include:

Emerging advanced analytics is often commingled with the business intelligence market. The marketing of these very different solution areas is often indistinguishable.

Confusion about cloud-based and edge analytics. There is still a lack of clarity about the role of the Cloud for analytics beyond IT cost and complexity benefits. As well the role of the Cloud for edge analytics is often misunderstood.

Advanced analytics is evolving at a very rapid pace. New solution providers are popping up daily. At the same time entrenched players are creating platforms applications and tools for IIoT and analytics. Confusing matters even more these entrenched players are also launching Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms which often also include analytics.

Resetting Analytics Categories

ARC Advisory Group uses three major categories to describe the business intelligence and analytics market. In this definition structure the two best-understood types descriptive and discovery are combined into the performance analytics category which is often referred to as business intelligence.

Performance analytics include descriptive and discovery solutions. Descriptive analytics look at past performance data to show what happened. It provides visualization of a statement of fact. A couple of common styles used to present information this way are static reports and static dashboards. These analytics don’t provide any way for a user to drill down into the data.

Discovery analytics introduces correlation. Using the same examination of past performance as descriptive analytics it begins to address the “why” of something occurring. Together with descriptive analytics they form the pillars of business intelligence.

Descriptive and discovery analytics are often embedded in operational systems and delivered via dashboards and other advanced visualization tools. They are often used to identify and capture best practices to support continual process improvement.

A good example of this combination begins with descriptive analytics that identify consistent seal failure in water injection pumps on an oil platform. By adding discovery analytics the business may then connect the performance to other factors such as equipment manufacturer crews installing or maintaining the asset condition of use etc.

Predictive analytics a type of advanced analytics focuses on future performance. It is best described as inductive as it looks at new data to determine the probability of something occurring. Predictive analytics leverage historical and real-time data and many solutions also use structured and unstructured forms.

Machine learning is often used for predictive analytics. As it ingests large amounts of data machine learning can identify discriminative patterns that identify the probability of a behavior occurring such as an asset failing. Machine learning techniques can adapt to incorporate new behaviors and data sets.

Forecasting is a common example of predictive analytics. Another is using a wide range of historical and real-time data both structured and unstructured to predict gearbox failure in a renewable energy wind turbine. Provided the risk for failure is identified in a timely enough manner operations and maintenance can take action to avoid asset failure.

Prescriptive extends the process started in predictive analytics (it can also do the same for discovery analytics). It does so by weighing options for problem solving suggesting an ideal approach and to varying degrees integrating action as part of the analytics. The key difference from predictive solutions is that these analytics can weigh potential outcomes to determine ideal actions without needing human intervention to do so.

A commonly understood example of prescriptive analytics is a self-driving car which continually optimizes decisions such as turn right turn left slow down or stop. Of course as has been shown in pilot projects with self-driving cars the results aren’t always perfect.

A good industrial example is continual optimization of workflow and goods across delivery or maintenance processes. As new uncertainties and constraints impact the environment the analytics model can continually prompt the correct decisions across workflow. The more optimized actions that are driven into those processes—work mobility supply chain customer service etc. — the more prescriptive (and valuable) the analytics become.

Lines Blur Between Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics

The lines often are blurred when distinguishing predictive from prescriptive analytics. Most often it occurs when an analytics solution is described as having a closed-loop component. In many instances the closed-loop process is described as prescriptive analytics. That is not necessarily accurate.

Predictive analytics can lessen the gap between insight and action. In these cases the solutions provide insight that failure must be remedied and can alert people and machines to act. At this point human intervention or automation occurs to determine and assign what gets done: retraining data models on machines changing an asset’s duty cycle maintenance replacement etc.

On the other hand prescriptive analytics are by their very nature closed-loop in that they provide specific guidance for human actions or automate a specific outcome. Like predictive analytics they can ingest data and identify patterns. However they also consider options determine the ideal action to take and can invoke that action. Thus prescriptive analytics remove the barrier between the insight gained and the action taken.

When predictive analytics are misidentified as prescriptive it usually occurs because of two capabilities that are characterized as proactively solving a problem:

Prescriptive Analytics Require a Knowledge Base and Automation

Prescriptive analytics build upon other types—descriptive discover and predictive—by adding answers as to what should be done. Prescriptive analytics differ from other forms of analytics in that they contain both a knowledge base and decision support automation. The knowledge base ensures that the correct remedy is identified; the automation helps carry it out.

In combination those components ensure that the analytics move from “actionable insight” to “insight plus informed action.” Currently prescriptive analytics are most effective when the desired outcome of the analyzed process is very clear. An example is the timely and accurate delivery of a package to a pre-defined address or applying a specific maintenance strategy. Using historic data applying prescriptive analytics is much simpler.

Consider an example of a prescriptive method built upon discovery analytics. For an asset performance management application the analysis could incorporate data such as performance rules inspection-based confidence ratings warranty maintenance schedules condition of use and work history. Based upon analysis of this historic data a performance anomaly is isolated. As an example it could be identifying high failure in assets of a certain make and models when operating at a specific cycle under certain conditions.

The analysis can automate the generation of a work order in an asset management system that pinpoints asset location. It can leverage an underlying knowledge base that determines the optimized maintenance strategy based on best practices and what craft skills and equipment are required. In this case the maintenance schedule is altered for all assets operating under those conditions in a way that is known to reduce failure rates.

The automated process can also identify the risk and work priority level. It can support the planning scheduling execution and close out of the work. The result is a continuum; from the insight and prescriptive action being identified to the work being completed.

In industrial settings the use of prescriptive analytics built upon prescriptive models is still in its formative stage. Prescriptive approaches must be able to determine what action to take without the certainty of hindsight. In this situation risk can be heightened as decisions are being made based upon the probability of what might occur. Contrast this to prescriptive solutions based upon historic performance where actions have occurred and outcomes are verifiable. Though reactive by nature when used only with historic data it’s usually easier to identify prescriptive remedies.

Advanced Prescriptive Analytics Modes

Layers of prescriptive analytics can be built upon a predictive model. Beginning with the building block of the predictive analytic common modes of advanced prescriptive analytics can be identified.

Mode 0: Predictive

The building block for prescriptive solutions is the predictive analytics mode. As discussed this mode is often put forward as prescriptive under the guise that it can automate an alert or prompt. However it is not supported by a knowledge base and so is not prescriptive.

An example is predicting failure for utility-scale wind turbines. Structured and unstructured data is ingested: asset nameplate blade angles historian information current and historic weather pictures and video maintenance records technician notes etc. Analysis detects anomalies. An alert is then pushed to a device or a system where it can be viewed by people.

Once detected the alert prompts a person to invoke inspection or maintenance planning and scheduling. In this way issues such as gearbox failure can be identified months in advance and remedied through maintenance or replacement.

Mode 1: Prescriptive + Advisement

The initial prescriptive analytics mode advises people as to what should be done to prevent or reduce risk. It does so by leveraging a knowledge base that has processed options and determined a corrective action such as optimized maintenance strategies. It automates the delivery of the prescriptive action to a person or people that can then execute the work.

A good example is the use of analytics to support routing for field work. Analytics are continually employed to optimize a route in real-time. Any number of static and dynamic external factors can be considered.

Third-party data can be incorporated such as traffic weather and construction. Using straightforward analysis ideal routes are suggested and acted upon by drivers on a real-time basis. However much more data can be incorporated beyond navigation to increase the value of the analysis.

Business-specific data can be leveraged. Examples could include customer lifetime value; complexity of work; craft skills available; equipment; fuel consumption and emissions; and even additional customer-facing data such as volume of negative social media sentiment being expressed. The analytics can consider these factors in real time. Dispatchers are continually advised on optimized assignment and management of field crews. Mobile crews are more effectively scheduled routed and prioritized throughout the day.

Mode 2: Prescriptive + Automation

As equipment has become “smarter” it is increasingly capable of adjusting its performance and configuration and where applicable be self-healing. Prescriptive analytics can take advantage of this smart connected equipment.

In this prescriptive mode the solution first uses predictive analysis. It combines that analysis with a knowledge base to determine what is the correct action for a device or piece of equipment. It then delivers this advisement to control systems or the equipment itself which then adjusts device behavior based on desired outcome.

The self-driving car is a well-known example. Much like mode 1 it continually analyzes data to determine ideal actions in real time. The obvious difference is that it is automating the execution of that advisement. The car speeds up or slows down turns right or left brakes etc.

Mode 3: Prescriptive + Optimization

The third mode delivers the most integrated far-reaching approach to problem solving. Because of that integration it also requires the most sophisticated management of processes and data across human resources systems devices assets and where applicable customers.

In this mode the prescriptive action is optimized as the solution delivers the corrective action at the right time to the right place equipment device system or person ideally suited to carry it out. In its most advanced uses this mode may extend well beyond the analyzed process to include external components such as supply chains and customer experience.

Use cases of this mode are currently uncommon in industrial settings but they are being employed in consumer-facing industries. Consider a cable television customer interacting with a call center agent to reduce or cancel service. Upon completion of the call the agent enters information into a customer care system which then sends the data to an analytics solution.

The analytic can integrate massive amounts of historic and real-time information: cohort social media sentiment customer communication preferences work history billing error current promotions etc. Using this data the analysis identifies the next best action for the company for this customer. And if built to do so it can also adapt its decision making as new data is ingested.

The prescriptive action could be pushed to an agent for a follow up on a specific date and time using a tailored offer. It could automate the delivery of that same or different offer out to the customer’s mobile phone. It could even do both at different times if that is the highest probable pathway to achieve the desired outcome.

Prescriptive Analytics Are Process Intensive

For industrial uses it is currently difficult to deliver advanced prescriptive analytics beyond tightly defined use cases. This has more to do with end user business processes than limitations inherent in the solutions themselves.

Implementing prescriptive solutions built upon predictive models requires high-level commitment by end users and intensive change management. There are two main reasons:

It requires organizations to be proactive with processes which typically requires a major cultural reorientation. This means organizations often must redesign existing processes that have been created for reactive work and/or support them in different ways. Systems equipment and devices must be able to support this reorientation.

The further analytics move past insight into action the more organizations will need to integrate and coordinate processes and data across systems people and equipment. At a point redesigning traditional approaches won’t be sufficient. Instead entire workflows will need to be created implemented adopted and supported.

This reorientation is complex and process intensive. Companies engaged in it must be comfortable with actions based on probabilities rather than historic verifiable views or gut feel based on experience.

Recommendations

Integrating prescriptive analytics into a business is challenging. It requires a level of commitment to change that is not often found in industrial settings where processes are rigidly embedded. In addition solutions that include prescriptive analytics are still in the infancy of development in industrial markets. However the outcome prescriptive approaches deliver should be your goal as you grow your analytics capabilities. The benefits are potentially transformational.

Based on ARC research and analysis we recommend the following for industrial organizations:

Pilot a use case in which the prescriptive solution is evident and the processes and data are well understood. Keeping it simple maximizes your chances for success while minimizing the organizational angst associated with change management.

Rely on your solution provider partner. Solution providers are beginning to integrate their industry knowledge into their analytics solutions particularly for asset management. Leverage that expertise when it comes to how to integrate knowledge bases into analytic-driven processes.

Consider the potential of prescriptive analytics using augmented reality (AR) particularly in the field. This may seem like adding “fuel to the fire” of analytics complexity but AR is a natural extension for prescriptive action. By combining analytics remote subject matter experts a mobile AR device and field workers prescriptive actions are possible at the point of decision making. The efficiency safety and cost benefits alone are worth the effort required.

After the debut of 'The Fiend' at SummerSlam it appeared the sports entertainment company had finally found its next hit and Wyatt was destined to conquer the top of the card.

WWE's new homicidal clown intrigued fans with his edgier themes and more vicious presentation. For a moment everything felt like it was going to be perfect. However naysayers were still quick to suggest the company would fumble its hottest act and they were quick to be correct.

Only two matches in and many fans had already given up on 'The Fiend.' All he had to be was a disturbed masked man who plowed through credible talent. Instead WWE subjected Wyatt to turbulent booking that often tarnished his gimmick's appeal.

Even so there have been many entertaining spots involving Wyatt since he reared his head again around 16 months ago. Unfortunately there were also many more moments that risked completely destroying 'The Fiend' for good.",,,,,,,,,

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

This big-mouthed sports car promised two-plus-two seating in an even smaller lighter package than the 86 contrasting the two-seat Mazda. Though the S-FR fell off the radar Toyota apparently didn't forget about it as Japanese media indicates the S-FR is finally cleared for production.

Citing Best Car Magazine which typically publishes original reporting in print before sharing it online Forbes says the S-FR will launch in late 2026 or early 2027. It's reported to be in co-development with Daihatsu and Suzuki which were previously rumored to be working on a small mid-engined model together. It seems that project has evolved into a more conventional front-engined rear-wheel-drive coupe that'll become the S-FR—with a larger more powerful engine.

Toyota S-FR Racing Concept. Toyota

Specifically the S-FR is reported to use a three-cylinder turbo engine making around 150 horsepower to turn the rear wheels. Curiously rumors of a revived Toyota Starlet with a GR performance version specify a similar engine; 150 hp from a 1.3-liter engine downsized from the one in the GR Corolla. This also matches the displacement of the engine in the Daihatsu Vision Copen concept from October which would seem to preview Toyota's next sports car. Or at least Daihatsu's version of it.

The S-FR's design will reportedly be overhauled for production with a smaller grille and altered headlights. There was no word as to the potential implementation of the S-FR Racing concept pictured above with its aggressive rear wing canards splitter and diffuser. These could feasibly be offered as accessories or even as exclusives on a hypothetical GR model. That's purely speculative on our part though.

Price-wise Toyota is reportedly targeting the equivalent of $22700. That wouldn't just undercut the Mazda MX-5 by around $6000 but also make it one of the cheapest new cars on sale in the U.S. period—if it makes it here. Toyota is reportedly undecided about selling the S-FR in the States where it already sells the similar GR86. Offering both could easily cannibalize sales potentially without taking as much share of Mazda's pie as intended.

There's also the question of where it'd fit with the supposed Celica reboot which could culminate in a thrifty fun rear-wheel-drive coupe to compete with the Honda Prelude. It too seems like it'd contend for S-FR and GR86 customers weakening the prospects for all involved. If the S-FR does come around my money's on it staying out of the States just like the Starlet is supposed to. I mean with Mazda locking down the small sports car market and the GR86 addressing one size up why even bother?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpZ2hlaGFtaWx0b24uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYW50b25pby1mb250ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonio S.

“Diogo [will be] two or three weeks maybe. Probably the medical department hits me now but I think that’s kind of possible back in full training and then we will see how long it takes.”

This week in a Q&A session for The Athletic James Pearce offered a little insight into the medical department’s game-plan for Jota which was lengthier than usual.

“Six to eight weeks was the hope which would have put him back in action by late Jan/early Feb” Pearce said. “However it was always going to depend on how Jota responded to different stages of the rehab process.”

“Also since Andreas Schlumberger joined the staff in December there’s been a greater focus on players who have done their rehab after injury doing extra work before being given the green light to return to full training” he added.

Dr. Schlumberger was recruited as Liverpool’s new head of recovery and performance in December 2020 to occupy a newly created role to work with the rest of the club’s medical staff.

“It’s all part of trying to ensure that when players come back from injury they don’t break down again” Pearce said.

Rumours are afloat that Jota could return to Liverpool training this week. If true he could then optimistically be available for Liverpool’s second leg tie against RB Leipzig in the Champions League the only tournament offering us any hope at this point.

When touching on the subject of injuries in his pre-match presser Jurgen Klopp confirmed that fans would have to wait a little while longer for the Portuguese though he did admit the forward was “getting closer”.

“Six to eight weeks was the hope which would have put him back in action by late Jan/early Feb” the journalist wrote in a Q&A for The Athletic. “However it was always going to depend on how Jota responded to different stages of the rehab process.”

“Also since Andreas Schlumberger joined the staff in December there’s been a greater focus on players who have done their rehab after injury doing extra work before being given the green light to return to full training” Pearce added. “It’s all part of trying to ensure that when players come back from injury they don’t break down again.”

His compatriot was brought in with the purpose of enhancing the recovery period of injured players.

While Schlumberger’s preference for Jota to do “extra work” would appear to go against that perceived role it does make a certain amount of sense for the long-term ensuring that our sidelined stars return when they have the best chance of finishing the rest of the season.

Though Liverpool are arguably in desperate need of the extra firepower our No.20 provided prior to his injury we’d much rather the certainty of the forward lasting throughout the remaining games.",,,,,,,,,

AIOps for Cloud and IT Infrastructure can enable intelligent operations for enterprise & mission critical functions Matthew Leybold · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 9 min read · Feb 21 2021 -- Listen Share

AIOps for Cloud and IT Infrastructure can enable intelligent operations for enterprise & mission critical functions (Photo by Markus Winkler on Unsplash)

In the broader cloud market hyperscale data centers cloud service providers (CSPs) and overall workload adoption on public cloud in the commercial and public sector continues to grow. Cloud adoption has steadily increased over the past several years and it is estimated that while 75% of workloads remain on-premises in classic IT and private cloud environments 25% of all enterprise workloads now reside in public cloud by way of legacy modernization & migration as well as cloud-native digital product development and engineering (1). The growth in public cloud adoption continues but we still have significant runway ahead of us for continued adoption development and evolution of cloud operations.

However with legacy application modernization and data migration legacy ways of working and operational constructs can and have already replicated themselves in the cloud as well. Many classic IT operations processes governance constructs & financial management approaches have been replicated from the data center into the private and public cloud. As heterogenous IT environments grow in complexity among both classic IT infrastructure remains and cloud-native the burden on IT operations is also growing. The flood of enterprise operational and mission-centric data that IT must manage the requirement of CIO’s to constantly do more with less and the shift from legacy to next-generation security models all contribute to these operational inefficiencies (2).

This is severely limiting the potential of your cloud & IT infrastructure environment. A foundation of true cloud-native product development and operations can and should be enhanced with intelligent operations also known as AIOps. Incorporating AIOps at every layer of the technology stack and every phase of an IT operational lifecycle can enhance your cloud and IT infrastructure environment to be significantly more predictive and intelligent nature even to the point by which aspects of your environment can be “zero touch” (e.g. automated remediation and self-healing).

What is AIOps?

A fast-growing set of tools and approaches to combat these problems lie within AIOps (also referred to as MLOps depending on vendor and use case) which is a method of utilizing big data advanced analytics and machine learning to enhance and automate IT operations & monitoring enabling intelligent operations of your IT environment. While it is early days IT leaders are starting to employ machine learning (ML) technologies within their own functions to effect operational efficiencies and cost reduction for enterprise technology. In the past few years a number of vendors have begun designing and developing powerful analytics tools to address the particular challenges that IT personnel face in managing updating and running IT hardware and software across the enterprise (3).

Core AIOps generally covers Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) use cases in key areas of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) including: Application Performance Monitoring IT infrastructure monitoring IT Event Correlation & Analysis and Network Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics.

What capabilities are the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Independent Software Vendors (ISV) bringing to bear?

There is a mix of both tool and vendor driven enablers in this space coupled with highly custom methods for aggregating operational data and driving differentiated insights for each AIOps use case. Some highlights include:

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

More generally AWS GCP and Azure are highly supportive of and integrate well with the key ISVs that bring to bear AIOps capabilities into the public cloud ecosystem.

While much native tooling is generally integrated and not native native configuration of public cloud services (e.g. CI/CD pipelines data services) can get you quite far in this domain. Check out GCP MLOps Azure MLOps and AWS MLOps (as well as AWS Sagemaker) to see what is possible with native CSP services as well as their embedded Machine Learning tech before introducing integrated tooling and services.

ISVs and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) vendors.

Splunk the “Data-to-Everything Platform” and which is well known for log management has expanded its platform as it is a logical event and data source for AIOps use cases. The Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit and Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations each provide a launch kit and tooling to operate natively in Splunk.

Moogsoft is more of a native platform engineered specifically for AIOps enablement integrates with a number of well-known tools and data sources and is supportive of a number of the use cases detailed below. Moogsoft delivers an enterprise-class cloud-native platform that empowers customers to drive adoption at their own pace at a much lower cost according to their website.

Open standards & Open Source heritage.

Elastic the creators of the ELK Stack are one of many examples of “Open Source heritage” solutions that have expanded into AIOps functionality. Elastic supports a number of machine learning use cases to include anomaly detection from event sourced data.

IT Service Management (ITSM) platforms.

ITSM platforms and Service Operations in general are absolutely central to the process and data that unlock AIOps use cases and capabilities. The two key leading ITSM vendors are offering out of the box capabilities in ServiceNow AIOps and BMC AIOps.

How can I enable AIOps and increase intelligent operations within my Cloud and IT infrastructure environment?

Get the operational foundation right.

IT Service Management (ITSM) and operations. Perhaps a dedicated article for another day but modern ITSM practices and operations are critical and foundational to AIOps and the lack of integrated automated ITIL functions for end-to-end IT processes are often a root cause for bolting on and integrating AIOps into your ecosystem for improvement of the environment. AIOps should enable continuous service improvement and a constant feedback loop for increasing the operational efficiency of your ITSM platforms and ITIL processes.

Increase your environment visibility and transparency.

Determine your initial AIOps strategy. First determine whether you are targeting discrete use cases and opportunity areas (e.g. anomaly detection noise reduction incident prediction automated issue remediation) or if this will be a broader experimentation and discovery effort to identify areas of opportunity for more focused deep dive and use case development. If the former this effort can get very targeted very quickly on the nature of data you need to source and what you are trying to solve for. If the latter the initiative should be stood up more in a pilot fashion to experiment and identify where the value proofs are in your environment by casting a much wider net.

Conduct a targeted initial data capture. Now that you have a sense for what you are solving for (or want to identify what it might be) you can key in on the tools data and layers of the infrastructure stack that you need to target for data capture. The figure below provides a good framework for your unique inputs and how they will affect the inventory static configuration and dynamic data elements ideal for capture in any given use case:

Figure 1: The data capture should be highly customized to accommodate use case requirements as well as customer data availability fidelity and unique criteria

Iteratively build and train the data model. This data capture establishes a starting point for identifying value proofs. You have created the “haystack”…. now you have to find the “needle”!

Figure 2: The data flow and process model illuminates how to build and operationalize the end-to-end AIOps lifecycle; the approach is agnostic while the techniques are use case specific

Feature engineering is now enabled by taking these ingested raw data assets and transforming them into input variables for applied machine learning techniques including error and incident counts thresholds and trends in IT operations data etc.

These input variables will present opportunities for certain use cases. For instance normalized error and incident data may suggest a value proof around an Anomaly Detection use case for detecting early signs of deviation from normal operational infrastructure and application behavior. You may then choose certain classification and machine learning methods (e.g. Isolation Forest clustering approaches) to further refine the data generate an anomaly score or other measurable unit for insights and generate a deliberate feedback loop to further refine and train the model to identify true failure events & reduce both false positives & actions. Multiple iterative agile improvement cycles will likely be required to sharpen the data model and insights into something truly informative to drive decision making and eventually automated action handling of identified anomalies in your cloud and IT infrastructure environment.

Here’s a much more detailed view and step by step mapping of what a use case fully enabled in your environment could look like for you:

Figure 3: A much more detailed outside-in view of a sample use case for anomaly detection for storage spikes illustrates how AI/ML can become a reality

Reduce the noise.

Convert visibility into findings that create a deep understanding of the issue. This iterative process to sharpening the data and findings will have a “noise reduction” effect in identifying what actually matters by removing false positives and / or negatives and exposing what is truly actionable or informs some action in your environment. These insights generated span a wide range of core use cases including:

· Noise reduction: the act of noise reduction itself is foundational to analyze data and patterns of alerts and subsequently filtering out false positives in order to enable more progressive use cases below

· Triaging and alert correlation: clustering and correlating alters from segments of your cloud & IT infrastructure environment into a single discrete incident in order to accelerate and provide transparency into the triage process

· Service impact analysis: drawing dependency mappings across clusters of identified events to analyze downstream or cascading effects both technical and business side of IT failures outages and other disruption events

· Root cause analysis: identifying and inferring the root causes of realized disruption events in the application and cloud / IT infrastructure tiers

· Forecasting: predicting future application requirements for infrastructure capacity & demand allocation

· Incident prediction: translate detected anomalies across the IT environment to predict and prevent future failures

… “extended” use cases can involve integration of these core examples out to DevOps / DevSecOps pipelines business outcomes IT Service Management (ITIL modules and processes) and core Network and Security Operations (NOC/SOC).

Generate informed decision making and automated actions.

Leverage deep understanding of the issue into recommendations to inform decisions or even take immediate automated remediation actions. Okay I have significantly more visibility into my enterprise environment all of these great insights… what can I actually do with it all to translate the data into something executable to be carried out. Can I take it a step further and decompose the data into tasks that are automated for a hands off autonomous environment. The potential is definitely here! Some key actioning use cases include:

· Remediation recommendation (manual acceleration): using machine learning techniques to develop an “expert” recommendation system to enable IT ops to more easily troubleshoot incident response

· Automated issue remediation (automation & orchestration): automatically trigger the resolution process in case of an incident also known as “self-healing”

What could this look like when I put all the technology and process components in place?

Below is an indicative reference architecture for what your environment could look like to include event and data sources a custom aggregator and data lake for your AIOps use case identification and refinement downstream visibility and action handling methods and a feedback loop to constantly improve your cloud and IT infrastructure environment and service operations functions:

Figure 4: Illustrative environment architecture of AIOps for IT infrastructure

… this can be built in any on-premise environment public CSP environment or even distributed across a hybrid and multi-cloud ecosystem depending on your environment posture and targeted use cases.

This should provide a high-level overview for what the art of the possible holds with AIOps and how you can take a heterogeneous complicated environment and decompose the signals from your environment sensors into a real autonomous continuous feedback loop of improvement for enterprise cloud and IT infrastructure operations. While nascent the tools capabilities data and methods are all present for a package that will bring your cloud from initial operating capability to the “Smart Cloud”.

Though an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims weighed on major stock indexes the proposal for a bigger stimulus offset most of the impact.

Latest data from the Labor Department showed jobless claims rose to 861000 defying economists’ prediction for a decline. The S&P 500 index pulled back after rallying early this week but regained strength in recent sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points early Friday.

After a busy year M&A activity started gaining pace once again. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto has agreed to acquire cloud technology provider Bridgecrew for $156 million while Accenture bought cloud and digital transformation consultancy Infinity Works for an undisclosed amount.

Amazon was in the spotlight mid-week after the e-commerce giant revealed plans to add Australia-based tech start-up Selz to its fold in what could be a move to tackle the growing competition from Shopify.

In another tech deal Crowdstrike clinched a deal to take over data analysis start up Humio for $400 million. Meanwhile paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has reached the final stages of selling its subsidiary Wattyl to coatings company Hempel.

Drug store chain CVS Health was among the first to publish results in the holiday-shortened week reporting a decline in earnings. On Wednesday Baidu nicknamed the Google of China reported mixed results for the final three months of 2020. The other important firms to have reported on that day include Shopify and Analog Devices.

Video streaming platform Roku brought cheer to shareholders Thursday by reporting profit for the second consecutive quarter probably ending a prolonged losing streak. Meanwhile it was a rather disappointing show from Walmart which released weaker-than expected earnings in the pre-market hours.

Wall Street is headed for another week of subdued activity on the earnings front. After beating the market’s estimates consistently in recent quarters supported by the rapidly growing gamin segment Nvidia will be reporting financial results on February 24. The other major announcements are expected from Autodesk Bestbuy and Monster Beverages – scheduled to release earnings on February 25.

Inside: An array of bright colors. Result: The perfect place for a young Dallas family.

Friends don't let friends decorate with gray—at least not if you're Kerri Goldfarb and Mia Brous (the designers behind the hit home boutique Madre in Dallas) and your friend is Katie Aisner.

""I love color. It makes me happy and it's family-friendly"" Aisner says. Good thing: She and her husband David have four young kids and they aren't shy about brights. When they lucked into the neighborhood of their dreams—the 1931 brick home sits on a lush greenbelt—Aisner called on Goldfarb and Brous to modernize the choppy layout and turn the dial up on the decor.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

""Because she's a friend we knew how to capture what works for her family"" Brous says. Mostly that meant adding more ways to enjoy the outdoors including installing the steel-and-glass doors at the back entrance for easier access and to let in more of the view. Seven wide archways between the ground-floor rooms capitalize on natural light.

Color was the key to linking the spaces. The designers set a bold sage-based scheme in the formal living room layering aubergine gold hot pink and cobalt on top. They remixed it in the kitchen where cornflower blue steps up as the star with green accents. And so it went throughout the lower level. It might have overwhelmed if not for the way they alternated rooms with white walls and those with vibrant tones or patterns.

Piling it on takes a deft touch. Thankfully Goldfarb and Brous spilled their secrets for filling a home with cheery hues.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

Make A Power Play

The small front entrance (originally the back door) prompted Goldfarb and Brous to pull out all the stops to give it a memorable identity. Whimsical botanical wallpaper (Woodland Carpet by Trustworth Studios) delivered. ""The entry paper captures most of the colors in the home"" Brous says. They plucked a seafoam green from the design to coat the baseboards and molding for an extra layer of polish.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor “We wanted a fancier sofa in the formal living room” Brous says “but we played it down by having it be a similar color to the wall versus contrasting. It makes it feel more enveloping.”

Dive Into The Details

""We layer a lot and it shows in the living room"" Goldfarb says. ""Wallpaper is one layer; color texture and scale of patterns are others."" In that quest for more they rely on small gestures: the shift in textures between the grass cloth wall and velvet sofa the sage grosgrain-ribbon trim topped with nailheads outlining the aubergine armchairs and the contrasting pillow welts. The goal isn't a rigid palette but unexpected combos with zip. ""Think of the color wheel and what hues complement each other"" Goldfarb says. ""If you're looking at lavender orange might make it come to life.""

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

Botanicals are a classic back-pocket art choice to fill a blank wall. Aisner describes her style as slightly traditional; the antique dresser and the grid formation of the floral display above it are nods to that.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor The pale celadon gourd lamps didn’t match the palette but the more tones the better. “Putting in something that’s unexpected and different is good too” Goldfarb says.

Start With Surfaces

""When I envision a home I decorate from the outside in"" Goldfarb says. ""What are the walls the floors and the ceilings? Then I go from there. This way spaces with individual identities flow together rather than compete."" The white walls and glossy wood-paneled ceiling in the family room (adjoining the wallpapered living room) freed her to drop the bulk of the color on the seating.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor Outdoor-rated armchairs and an indoor-outdoor rug endure all the kids’ playing and spills.

Watch One Fabric Reign

After dividing the large family room by function the designers generously deployed a leafy green fabric on the sunroom side to give it a distinct look. ""Using one fabric makes it cohesive"" Brous says. ""Even though it's open it's defined because it coordinates."" Rattan seating emphasizes the point.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

Let Love Guide You

Solid ivory curtains? Not for Aisner. ""Orange is one of my favorite colors so the drapes were our splurge"" she says. ""I had my heart set on them."" To accent that choice Goldfarb and Brous opted for lighter pieces with modern silhouettes like a custom cerused oak card table.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor Rattan and plastic combine into an easy-to-wipe-down barstool that bumps up the texture in the room.

Take A Breather

The tide of color ebbs a bit in the kitchen where white walls (Sherwin-Williams' Alabaster SW 7008) and cabinetry offer a visual break from the brighter hues used elsewhere. ""A kitchen creates its own clutter so it's nice to keep the look clean"" Brous says.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

Keep The Focus On The View

The kitchen's sitting area is all about what's outside the walls: the greenbelt. So Goldfarb and Brous blanketed the furnishings and windows in tone-on-tone blues with a touch of sage to marry it to the nearby rooms. ""I sit here early in the morning and feel so grateful that I have this family and this house and get to look out on the pretty green space"" says Aisner. ""It's my happy place.""

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

Pick Forever Fabrics

""Do it once and do it well so you can carry it with you"" Goldfarb says. The dusty-pink floral that shines in Aisner's then 7-year-old daughter's bedroom came directly from her nursery in a previous home. Here they filled in with blue accents to boost that aspect of the print.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor Lime green pom-pom trim on the otherwise basic white shade adds a touch of playfulness that’s just right for a young girl.

Invest In This One Designer Trick

Goldfarb and Brous say a room isn't finished until you zhuzh up the lampshade. It's their favorite way to take a look to the next level. Full pleated shades (like the ones in Aisner's youngest daughter's room) are the gold standard but the designers are just as likely to wrap a paper shade in remnant fabric apply a bit of material to the top and bottom as trim or do the same with ribbon. Count Aisner as a fan. These shades—along with the headboard and shams—were done for her previous home's guest room. She liked them so much that she made sure they found a place here.

Alison Gootee; Styling: Jenny O'Connor

Dive Into The Details

A classic all-white palette was the starting point for the boys' shared bath. For a subtle edge the designers covered the window seat with a playful Quadrille geometric fabric and installed a pair of industrial sconces (by Visual Comfort & Co.) directly on top of the wall-to-wall mirrors.

Here's how to check if you have it,"Snapchat does have a dark mode setting but it isn't available to all users yet.

does have a setting but it isn't available to all users yet. As of this writing Snapchat dark mode is only available to iPhone users in Australia and some parts of the US.

If dark mode is available on your Snapchat account you can enable it in your Snapchat profile's settings.

Many social media apps have a ""dark mode"" these days allowing users to change the color of their app's interface to darker tones instead of bright ones which can look better and sometimes even save battery life.

For a long time Snapchat has been one of the few major social media apps without dark mode. But that's soon going to change - or depending on where you live it might have already changed.

Snapchat has a dark mode but it isn't widely available yet

Snapchat does have a dark mode yes but this feature still isn't available to many users. Snapchat's dark mode is currently only available for iPhone users in Australia and some parts of the US. Unfortunately they haven't revealed which parts those are.

To find out if you can use dark mode on Snapchat and to enable it if you can follow these steps.

How to enable dark mode on Snapchat

1. Open the Snapchat app on your mobile device and log in if you're prompted to do so.

2. In the upper-left corner of your screen tap on your profile picture.

3. In the upper-right corner of your screen tap on the icon that looks like a gear. This will open the Settings menu.

4. In the Settings menu scroll until you see an option called ""App Appearance."" If you can't find App Appearance in your Settings menu it means that you currently aren't able to use dark mode on Snapchat.

5. In the ""App Appearance"" menu tap ""Always Dark"" to enable Snapchat's dark mode. You can also set it to match your iPhone's settings so if your iPhone changes between light and dark automatically throughout the day so will Snapchat.

And Christine McGuinness posted a sweet snap on Saturday showing twins Leo and Penelope seven and Felicity five eating McDonald's and watching TV.

The model 32 revealed the quiet meal was the 'first time' since moving house three months ago that the youngsters had sat together - and joked that she was waiting for 'things to kick off'.

Doting mum: Christine McGuinness shared another glimpse into life with her three autistic children as she shared a snap of them eating McDonald's together on Saturday

In the lovely image the three children are seen each sitting in a comfortable black chair as they watch cartoons and enjoy a McDonald's Happy Meal.

The siblings seem to be in the McGuinness dining room which boasts a white table and several more seats by a built in fire as well as floor length curtains.

Christine penned: 'All 3 children sat eating together at the table and all watching the same programme.. any minute now this will kickoff!'

The blonde beauty then replied to one fan who said they'd yet to achieve the same feat writing: 'This is the first time since we moved house 3 months ago.'

Siblings: In the candid image twins Leo and Penelope seven and Felicity five are seen calmly eating McDonald's and enjoying some cartoons on the TV while their mother watches on

Mum always knows: The blonde beauty joked that she was expecting things to 'kickoff any minute' as she watched her children eat

And although enjoying the moment of serenity Christine later told Katie Price's ex Kieran Hayler that the calm had ended after just seven minutes.

She wrote: 'It's already over! Lasted a strong 7 minutes but that is a record for this year!'

Christine often shares candid snaps of her children as they do school work at home during lockdown and enjoy quality time together recently posting an image of them sweetly reading new book Grumbalina.

It comes after Christine revealed her youngest daughter Felicity has developed a stutter in lockdown due to lack of social contact.

The Real Housewives Of Cheshire star appeared on Loose Women on Thursday and detailed the impact of the pandemic on her kids.

Achievement: Christine replied to one fan revealing it was the first time since moving into her new home three months ago that the children had sat together for dinner and TV

Enjoy it while it lasts! She also laughed as she told Kieran Hayler that the quiet time lasted for a 'strong 7 minutes' adding that it was 'a record for this year'

Felicity's speech has been affected as the kids' speech and communication has regressed since they have been in lockdown at home with all three children struggling with the communication they have worked so hard to build.

She said: 'It's really affected their speech I spent years and years going to speech and language therapy with the children they've all gone back with their speech and communication my youngest daughter has developed a stutter'.

Christine has her three kids with husband Paddy 47 and she has always been candid about living with autism and how the family cope with their condition.

On lockdown and the kids she detailed: 'It's really affected their speech. They've regressed quite a lot. Again speech doesn't come naturally to them...

Her loves: Christine pictured reading Grumbalina recently revealed her youngest daughter Felicity five has developed a stutter in lockdown due to lack of social contact

'Spent years going to speech and language therapy with the children and I still do but they've all gone backwards with their speech and communication skills...

'My daughter Felicity developed a stutter over the first lockdown which was never there before. It was every single word so it was quite severe...

'She is still in speech therapy getting help for that it has got a little bit better now she's gone back to nursery. But these are problems that definitely wouldn't have come into our lives if it wasn't for the global pandemic.'

She went on: 'It's been a rollercoaster. It started off extremely difficult for everyone it was a massive shock. Our kids are autistic and they struggle with shock...

'All of these differences were suddenly thrown at them the school was closed not allowed friends or family over which we used to do at weekends we couldn't go to the park.

Opening up: The Real Housewives Of Cheshire star spoke while appearing on Loose Women on Thursday and detailed the impact of the pandemic on her kids

What is a stammer/stutter? Stammering varies in severity from person to person and from situation to situation. Someone might have periods of stammering followed by times when they speak relatively fluently. There are 2 main types of stammering: - Developmental stammering – the most common type of stammering that happens in early childhood when speech and language skills are developing quickly - Acquired or late-onset stammering – is relatively rare and happens in older children and adults as a result of a head injury stroke or progressive neurological condition. It can also be caused by certain drugs medicines or psychological or emotional trauma It is not possible to say for sure why a child starts stammering but it is not caused by anything the parents have done. Developmental and inherited factors may play a part along with small differences in how efficiently the speech areas of the brain are working. Advertisement

'With three children that struggle with change anyway and don't really understand an awful lot that was extremely difficult for them to suddenly change overnight...

'We did kind of get used to it over the summer they did stop asking about going out and that's sort of where we're at now. It's quite sad really that they now accept it's normal to stay in...

'We've spent years and years encouraging our children it doesn't come naturally to them to go and socialise going out to busy places and new places like play centres – they can be quite frightening – it took them years to do that quite happily...

'Now they don't even ask about it it's like it doesn't exist anymore. It's quite sad. I do think if/when things go back to normal we're going to have to start again with all of that. We're going to have to really build up their confidence again as anxiety is through the roof.

'As an example I stopped at the petrol station I took my son in with me and somebody walked past and he literally threw himself back from this person as he was so petrified of someone walking near him. It's sad that's the reality of today.'

Despite the hard times Christine gushed: 'We've had some magical magical moments. And overall they're happy they're healthy and they're doing absolutely amazing and I love them to bits and I'm dead proud.'

Speaking about homeschooling she said: 'I feel for everyone doing homeschooling. It's not tailored for children with additional needs it really isn't. They're very black and white our children school is school and home is home...

'We can manage an art class and P.E the fun things but the actual homeschooling sitting in front of a computer it's just not right. I don't think it's nice for any children… we are trying to get them back into full time...

'They started doing a couple of hours and we're building it up to full time. Again it's just a very very slow long process for our children to build it back up. Hopefully next week they'll go back to full time.'

Her love: Christine has her three kids with husband Paddy 47 and she has always been candid about living with autism and how the family cope with their condition

Her appearance comes after it was reported that Christine and Paddy are set to reveal the challenges of raising children with autism in a new BBC documentary Autism And Our Family.

Christine has always been open about her children's highs and lows in living with autism and the family is now said to be going to document those moments.

The one-off documentary set to air this year will follow the couple as they share their story with viewers and seek answers about their children's autism diagnosis.

It will also follow them as they meet with other parents paediatricians and child-development experts to learn more about the developmental disability.

Christine often shares her experiences with her children on social media and gives advice and support to parents in the same boat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvZGF2aWQtYmVja2hhbS1iaXJ0aGRheS1ib3ktY3J1ei0yMzU0MDM1MdIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay8zYW0vY2VsZWJyaXR5LW5ld3MvZGF2aWQtYmVja2hhbS1iaXJ0aGRheS1ib3ktY3J1ei0yMzU0MDM1MS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Beckham and birthday boy Cruz ditch masks for cosy snap with Marc Anthony,"David Beckham and birthday boy Cruz celebrated without their masks on while they posed for a photo with Marc Anthony

Just look at predominantly Black neighborhoods throughout the country such as Detroit Michigan and Columbia South Carolina. The median energy burden of Black households in Detroit is 54 percent higher than that of non-Hispanic white households. Black families who face high energy burdens have to make tradeoffs between utility payments and other necessities and now that burden has made those same families more susceptible to the life-threatening impacts of COVID-19.

What these predominantly Black communities have in common is a practice known as redlining—a racial residential segregation policy from the 1930s. Through redlining financial institutions can either refuse to offer mortgages or offer worse loan rates to customers looking to buy houses in neighborhoods occupied by people of color—denying hardworking families access to homeownership and the American dream.

The racist redlining practices of the housing industry created neighborhoods throughout the United States with high energy burdens and in those areas Black communities often show a higher prevalence of exposure to pollution and poverty. For example due to systematic racist targeting through redlining much of Michigan’s energy insecurity is concentrated in Detroit—the largest Black-majority city in the United States. The mayor of Detroit recently stated that “African Americans are more likely to suffer from heart disease asthma and chronic kidney disease which could be making their recovery from the virus more difficult.”

In Columbia South Carolina many of the redlined communities are predominantly Black and experience a high energy burden. Energy expenditures remain the same regardless of income level with some predominantly Black communities with median household incomes of $30000 spending the same amount on energy as predominantly white communities with median household incomes of $100000.

The United States’ long shameful history of discriminatory housing policies and racial segregation is part of the reason why Black families are more likely to live in older energy-inefficient homes that saddle them with higher energy burdens (6 percent energy burden or higher) than white families at almost every position in the income distribution. High energy burdens not only threaten a family’s ability to pay for energy but it also forces already struggling families to make tough choices between paying energy bills or buying food medicine or other essentials.

Fifty years after the abolition of slavery local governments still found a way to disenfranchise Black communities by legally enforcing housing segregation through exclusionary zoning laws that prohibited the sale of property to Black people. In 1917 when the Supreme Court ruled these zoning laws unconstitutional homeowners swiftly replaced them with racially restrictive covenants—agreements between property owners that banned the sale of homes in a neighborhood to certain racial groups.

In 1934 the FHA and the Homeowners Loan Coalition (HOLC) a federally funded program created to help homeowners refinance their mortgages introduced redlining policies in over 200 US cities including Atlanta Chicago Detroit and others with large minority populations. The HOLC included in the FHA Underwriting Handbook “residential security maps” which were color-coded according to racist anti-Black guidelines: Green (“Best”) represented in-demand up-and-coming neighborhoods where “professional men” lived lacking “a single foreigner or negro”; Blue (“Still Desirable”) neighborhoods that had “reached their peak” but were thought to be stable due to their low risk of “infiltration” by non-white groups; Yellow (“Definitely Declining”) areas considered risky due to the “threat of infiltration of foreign-born negro or lower grade populations”; and Red (“Hazardous”) neighborhoods where “infiltration” had already occurred.

While the Fair Housing Act of 1968 explicitly ended legally sanctioned redlining policies practices that encouraged lending discrimination like those used by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) were difficult to eliminate and have continued even in recent years.

We will never be successful in our movement for a healthy safe and sustainable planet if we do not intentionally and actively fight to dismantle racism in all of its forms. If we address structural racism and inequity in the way that we combat the climate crisis we can stop investments in aging coal power plants and gas infrastructure and drastically reduce energy insecurity and fossil fuel pollution for Black communities.

Increasing investments in energy efficiency programs and targeting those investments to Black communities can help reduce high energy burdens make energy bills more affordable and vastly improve worsening health disparities caused by COVID-19. There are opportunities to work with utilities local and state governments and utility commissions to set energy affordability goals and track outcomes while identifying and targeting Black communities for programs to serve. Additionally there is an opportunity to increase a home’s value when energy efficiency upgrades are made.

Many of the same utilities that are holding on to coal plants and spending billions of dollars on gas infrastructure also serve Black customers that have the highest energy burdens in the country. Southern Company claims on its website that “racism has no place in our company and communities.” Alabama Power a subsidiary of Southern Company supplies electricity to 1.4 million Alabamians including the city of Birmingham. In Birmingham a town that is over 70 percent Black 153330 households have a high energy burden. The 2020 ACEEE scorecard ranked Alabama Power as 52nd in energy efficiency among the country’s 52 largest utilities. The Southern Company system generates approximately 22 percent of its electric power from coal and 50 percent from natural gas.

We Energies the electricity supplier for Milwaukee states that it stands with its customers in rejecting all forms of racism. But in Milwaukee one in four Black families has an energy burden at or above 15.5 percent. We Energies generates 45 percent of its electric power from coal and 24 percent from gas. The 2020 ACEEE scorecard ranked We Energies as 23rd in energy efficiency among the country’s 52 largest utilities.

An anti-racist climate movement gives us the foundation to build a more durable base of environmentalists who are focused first and foremost on their health their wealth and their community's survival. This is key to building the kind of lasting political power we need to make the changes that are necessary to confront the overlapping crises of these times. This is especially important for Black people who are being hit by the syndemic of COVID-19 energy burden climate crisis white supremacy and state-sanctioned economic deprivation.

It will take a truly inclusive movement to remediate the earth from centuries of systematic racism and ultimately save our planet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2tpbnNleS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQtaW5zaWdodHMvZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWFuZC1pbmNsdXNpb24vcmFjZS1pbi10aGUtd29ya3BsYWNlLXRoZS1ibGFjay1leHBlcmllbmNlLWluLXRoZS11cy1wcml2YXRlLXNlY3RvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black workers in the US private sector | McKinsey,"This report explores Black workers in the private sector in three parts: first their participation in the entire US private-sector economy; second their representation advancement and experience in companies; and third a path forward that includes the key challenges to address actions companies can take and additional actions for a wider set of stakeholders to accelerate progress on diversity equity and inclusion (DE&I).

The participation of Black workers in the US private-sector economy

Race in the workplace The Black experience in the US private sector (71 pages)

In the United States Black workers account for 15 million or 12 percent of the 125 million US private-sector workers. The overall Black labor force including the entire private sector public sector and the unemployed looking for work is 20.6 million. Our analysis of economic data primarily drawn from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Census Bureau from 2019 as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 2018 reinforces the immense complexity of the challenge facing many of the Black private-sector workers today.

The concentration of the Black labor force by geography industry and occupation creates challenges and mismatches

Overall our analysis found that Black workers are underrepresented in the highest-growth geographies and the highest-paying industries. Meanwhile they are overrepresented in low-growth geographies and in frontline jobs which tend to pay less.

1

The Black labor force is concentrated in states in the South

Almost 60 percent of the Black labor force (11.8 million people) is concentrated in the South compared with just one-third of the rest of private-sector workers (Exhibit 1). As a result companies located in states with low Black populations—for example much of the West and parts of the Midwest and Northeast—will need to think differently about how they effectively attract Black talent (Exhibit 2).

2

The Black labor force is not located in the fastest-growing regions

Author insights “A leader should be asking: ‘Given my geography my industry my location what are the best ways to make pathways for my Black frontline workers?’”

—Bryan Hancock partner McKinsey & Company



Overall Black workers are not located in the places where current job opportunities are and where job growth will likely rise the fastest through 2030. For example fewer than one in ten Black workers is located in the fastest-growing cities and counties (such as Provo Utah). Instead they overwhelmingly live in places where job growth will range from low to above average with the bright spots being in megacities (such as Chicago) and urban periphery (such as Clayton County Georgia). For the growth to be inclusive in these areas workers need to be connected to the opportunities being created (for example transportation between Black neighborhoods and job locations) and have the right skills for in-demand jobs.

Almost half of Black workers are in three industries with a large frontline presence with significant underrepresentation especially in high-growth high-wage industries

Our analysis found that 45 percent of Black private-sector workers (approximately 6.7 million people) work in three industries that have a large frontline-service presence: healthcare retail and accommodation and food service. These industries also have some of the highest shares of workers making less than $30000 (Exhibit 3). In retail 73 percent of Black workers fall into this category; in accommodations and food service that share is 84 percent.

Conversely Black workers are underrepresented in industries such as information technology professional services and financial services—all sectors that typically have relatively higher wages and job growth.

More Black workers are in jobs with less opportunity for advancement

More Black private-sector workers 43 percent make less than $30000 per year compared with 29 percent of the rest of private-sector employees (Exhibit 4). In addition Black workers tend to be in the industries with the largest frontline labor forces. Three in five Black workers work in frontline jobs such as service workers laborers operatives and office and clerical workers.

Black workers are at higher risk of disruption from automation

Automation will prove disruptive to the labor force in the years to come but its impact won’t be evenly distributed. For example one-third of Black workers are in occupational groups such as production work food service and office support which are at heightened risk of losing their jobs to automation. One encouraging trend: health aides is the occupational group with the highest expected job growth through 2030 and these occupations are disproportionately filled by Black workers.

Job prospects are markedly different for Black and white workers with similar backgrounds

Black workers face higher hurdles to gainful employment than do the rest of the labor force creating stark disparities. For example the employment rate for Black workers with some college or an associate’s degree are similar to the total population of workers who have a high-school diploma.

The Black experience in the workplace: Findings from participating companies

Our research drew on data from 24 participating companies ranging in size from 10000 to 1.4 million US employees and across all geographies representing a total of about 3.7 million US employees. Several key insights emerged:

Black employees encounter representation gaps at each step

According to our analysis companies have successfully hired Black employees into frontline and entry-level jobs but there is a significant drop-off in representation at management levels. In the report’s participating companies Black employees make up 14 percent of all employees compared with 12 percent for the US private sector overall. At the managerial level the Black share of the workforce declines to 7 percent. Across the senior manager VP and SVP levels Black representation holds steady at 4 to 5 percent (Exhibit 5).

5

Black employees face five common challenges in the private sector

Based on findings from the participating companies Black employees face five common challenges that materially affect Black representation advancement and experience:

Frontline jobs largely do not connect Black employees with sufficient opportunities to advance. Our data set of participating companies shows that Black employees are overrepresented in frontline jobs (18 percent) compared with managerial jobs (9 percent). Frontline jobs could be a launching pad for careers but today there is just one frontline salaried position for every 20 frontline hourly jobs reinforcing the need for pathways within and across industries.

Entry-level jobs are a revolving door and Black employee attrition is high. Black employees make up 12 percent of entry-level employees (such as account associates software engineers and paralegals). While hiring has been effective the higher attrition of Black employees—they are leaving their jobs more often than their white counterparts at almost all levels—reduces the number of Black candidates available for promotion.

Black employees encounter a broken rung from entry-level jobs to managerial jobs. Black employees account for just 7 percent of managers. This broken rung and higher-than-expected attrition rates in the pipeline significantly limit representation at subsequent levels of the company. For Black employees who are able to make it to the manager level we see some promising signs in promotion rates for these employees.

A trust deficit exists between Black employees and their companies. A trust deficit reflects Black employee perceptions of their workplace as less fair accepting and authentic. For example Black employees are 23 percent less likely to receive “a lot” or “quite a bit” of support to advance 41 percent less likely to view promotions as fair and 39 percent less likely to believe their company’s DE&I programs are effective than white employees in the same company.

Black employees lack the sponsorship and allyship to support their advancement. Most Black employees are ambitious and want to advance but perceive a lack of support to help them ascend to management jobs. Only 23 percent of Black employees and 30 percent of white employees believe they get “a lot” or “quite a bit” of support to advance. More than 67 percent of Black employees and 63 percent of white employees report they do not have a sponsor despite 87 percent of our participating companies reporting that they have sponsorship programs in place.

Variability in representation across companies

Variability in representation among the companies in our participating company data set suggests reasons to be optimistic. Although no company has solved the challenge of increasing Black representation at all job levels many have made significant inroads at specific points in the pipeline. Their successes could hold the key to more favorable outcomes across the private sector.

A path forward

On the current trajectory it will take about 95 years for Black employees to reach talent parity (or 12 percent representation) across all levels in the private sector. Addressing the major barriers that hold back the advancement of Black employees could cut that duration to about 25 years.

Achieving equity for Black workers in the private sector is a structural and multivariate challenge that cuts across many facets of geography industry and occupations as well as advancement and inclusion in the workplace.

Companies and other stakeholders will need to address ten key challenges to create opportunities

Truly making progress will require more than addressing corporate policies; it calls for system-level change an examination of our broader society and active collaboration among companies and other stakeholders.

While the challenges are daunting our research found some bright spots that companies can build on. Trends for both Black representation in the private sector and the promotion rates for Black men and women have shown improvement. High representation in faster-growing and higher-paying industries for Black workers such as transportation could present opportunities in the coming years. Nine in ten Black employees believe they are helping their company succeed and that their work gives them a sense of purpose and accomplishment. In addition our research uncovered pockets of progress on DE&I programs and representation in different companies which provides the potential for shared learning of best practices across companies.

Companies can take a number of actions immediately to address their own workforce and culture. Our research as well as findings by others suggest the following no-regrets moves.

Define your company’s aspiration for addressing racial equity—including steps to address structural barriers

Understand your company’s current state of DE&I taking into account industry and geographic contexts

Strategically prioritize interventions

Reinforce what works—and reimagine what doesn’t

Track progress to increase accountability—and share successes

Beyond actions by individual companies a more concerted effort may be required. Companies should consider the following efforts to build broader momentum for effecting system-level change.

Share best practices on effective programs

Pursue collaborative efforts to galvanize collective action

Commit to continued investment and research

Author insights “Black employees are seeing companies saying the right things making public announcements and monetary commitments to diversity equity and inclusion but the execution is lacking.”

—Monne Williams partner McKinsey & Company

The Racial Equity Institute writes “Our systems institutions and outcomes emanate from the racial hierarchy on which the United States was built. In other words we have a ‘groundwater’ problem and we need ‘groundwater’ solutions.”

Companies have an important role to play—along with other stakeholders. It is our hope that this paper helps to inform the conversation on the path forward. We plan to continue to contribute and be part of this journey.

Workplace privacy is back in style and one small Southern Nevada company is taking advantage.

Cubicall which designs and builds private workspaces that resemble phone booths was incorporated in Southern California in 2017 by brothers Anthony and Nick Pucci. They moved the company to North Las Vegas last year.

Cubicall got its start after the brothers with backgrounds in sales and marketing decided to use an old phone booth as a private workspace at their former marketing firm.

“We thought there must be some just sitting in a field someplace” Anthony Pucci said.

They actually found someone selling old phone booths that were sitting in an empty field in Texas but they were too expensive and were not going to be easy to move.

The Puccis solved their problem by building their own booth.

“Once we built that first booth we had clients at our marketing firm comment about it asking where they could get one” Anthony Pucci said. “We put a website up to see what would happen and we sold five in about two weeks.”

Cubicall makes modular privacy booths two-person meeting rooms and study booths that range in price from about $7000 to $12000.

The privacy booths can be for commercial or home use and are easily customized. A Superman-themed booth is on display at Cubicall’s headquarters.

So far much of the business done by Cubicall has been with companies with open workspaces and little opportunity for privacy.

The company has filled orders for some recognizable outfits including Bloomberg and BlackRock a large investment firm based in New York City.

As businesses cope with the coronavirus pandemic and even after it passes “I don’t think we’ll see as many of the densely populated office spaces” Anthony Pucci said. “There will be more space and division. People are going to want solutions like ours.”

The company has also started making exam booths for health care customers which they see as a big growth area following the emergence of the coronavirus.

Earlier this month they announced a partnership with a company that specializes in ultraviolet lighting to equip booths with UV lamps that disinfect the pods after each use.

“The health care angle is a huge opportunity for us” Nick Pucci said. “Hospitals private practices medical research — those are all opportunities for us.”

Cubicall’s move to North Las Vegas — the company has three full-time employees in addition to its owners — was done largely because of Nevada’s more business-friendly environment and tax code the Puccis said.

“California can be a difficult place to do business especially manufacturing” Nick Pucci said. “There’s the cost of doing business and also a higher cost of living.”

The brothers also considered moving to Texas Tennessee and Florida but Southern Nevada seemed to make the most sense.

They are close to Los Angeles the company’s biggest market and view the trade show industry as another growth market though conventions have been almost nonexistent in Las Vegas since the onset of the pandemic.

“When trade shows come back that should be a big shot in the arm for us” Anthony Pucci said. “We did business with one company that wanted to do a podcast from a trade show and wanted the space to be able to do that in a quiet area.”

Cubicall is “a great example of the kinds of innovative businesses that are now calling greater Las Vegas home due to quality of life cost and opportunity” said Jonas Peterson president and CEO of the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance which works to develop the region’s economy.

The Pucci brothers said that the reaction people have to their phone-booth style workspaces tends to depend on how old they are.

“When you bring one of these into an office it’s funny because all the older people will say ‘Oh the phone booth is back’” Nick Pucci said. “But the millennials and the younger people will say ‘Wow this is a genius idea. I can’t believe nobody’s ever thought of this before.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL3NvdXRoZXJuLWNpdGllcy1oaXQtaGFyZC1ieS1zdG9ybXMtZmFjZS1uZXctY3Jpc2lzLW5vLXdhdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern cities hit hard by storms face new crisis: No water,"AUSTIN — Southern cities slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Busted water pipes ruptured by record-low temperatures created shortages of clean drinking water shut down the Memphis airport on Friday and left hospitals struggling to maintain sanitary conditions.

In Texas 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — were under orders to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260000 homes and businesses in the Tennessee county that includes Memphis were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and pumping station problems. Restaurants that can’t do so or don’t have bottled water were ordered to close. And water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights.

In Jackson Mississippi most of the city of about 161000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system” said Lumumba.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking but residents had to pick it up leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to go to the pharmacy.

“People are in dire need here” Thomas said.

Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a half hours after arriving.

“We need water the stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have” Davis said.

The water woes were the latest misery for people across the South who went without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week forcing rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.

Texas electrical grid operators said electricity transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity to warm up home — buckling the state’s power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.

Smaller outages remained but Bill Magness president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas said the grid now can provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power. About 60000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm. Oregon’s governor ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in the hardest-hit areas to ensure residents have enough food and water.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 69 people including many who perished struggling to get warm and a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered onto a frozen pond.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel water blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning.”

In many areas water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing authorities said.

As of Friday afternoon more than 1300 Texas public water systems and 159 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions affecting more than 14.9 million people according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman Tiffany Young.

More than 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) of water was being trucked Friday to the Texas capital. But Austin’s water director Greg Maszaros implored residents to minimize the use of home faucets because “there’s still a lot of unknowns as we pressurize the system.”

In Dallas David Lopez said the plumbing company he works for received more than 600 calls for service over the last week.

“It’s pretty much first come first served” said Lopez as he and a colleague manhandled a new water heater out of their van on Friday. “Everyone’s got emergencies.”

Houston residents probably will have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday said Mayor Sylvester Turner.

Water service was restored Friday to two Houston Methodist community hospitals but officials still were bringing in drinking water and some elective surgeries were canceled spokeswoman Gale Smith said.

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis said it was forced to switch to bottled water and bagged ice for all consumption and that staff and patients were washing with hand sanitizer and no-rinse bathing wipes. All non-urgent surgeries were postponed.

Central Arkansas Water in the Little Rock area asked customers to conserve water to help protect its system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was “critically low” and also asked customers to conserve.

In Little Rock the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building — causing extensive damage to theaters galleries and offices and killing one display animal a blue-tongued skink lizard.

More than 192000 Louisiana residents -- some still struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura -- had no water service Friday according to the state health department. Tens of thousands more remained under boil-water advisories.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas with a focus on hospitals nursing homes and dialysis centers Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said adding that he was hopeful that warmer weather expected during the weekend would speed up repairs.

In the Louisiana community of Hackberry Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and sent her two daughters to stay at another home.

“People are still just struggling over here” she said.

Was it because of his philandering? Or finances?

Louisiana Salesman With A History Of Infidelity Shot And Killed By His Wife And Her BFF

Born in New Orleans and raised in Independence Louisiana Brian Davis was an avid fisherman and outdoorsman who also enjoyed competitive shooting singing karaoke and playing golf. He lived a seemingly normal life — but on July 1 2009 Davis a 39-year-old insurance company sales manager was found dead at the end of a desolate road south of Lake Charles Louisiana where he’d been living.

Brian had been shot four times. His body was discovered in a field near his blue Honda Accord. The car was up on a jack and lug nuts were removed from a tire while a spare was on the ground nearby. It looked like Brian may have been changing a tire before being executed.

That tire became a key piece of evidence in bringing Brian's killers to justice authorities told “Killer Motive” airing Saturdays at 6/5c on Oxygen.

Two days before the discovery of Brian's body by an off-road ATV rider he had been on a local boat-shopping outing with his wife Robyn Davis. The two had wed in 2008 after meeting at work. It was the third marriage for Brian who had a history of infidelity and her second.

After looking at boats with his wife Brian reportedly continued on to Beaumont Texas about a 90-minute drive from Lake Charles to shop there. He didn’t return home that night which some attributed to violent bad weather that had come up unexpectedly.

Robyn Little Davis and Brian Davis

Robyn filed a missing persons report after Brian was gone for 24 hours. His body was found a day after that. His shoes were off and his belt was loosened investigators observed.

It appeared that “either he was having some kind of encounter with somebody or they were looking for something on him” Tony Mancuso Calcasieu Parish Sheriff told “Killer Motive” host Troy Roberts.

The firearm Brian was known to carry was not at the scene nor was his GPS or his laptop. However the fact that he was still wearing a valuable ring suggested that this wasn’t a robbery gone deadly. And because of the inclement weather any forensic evidence that might have been recovered from lug nuts or the jack had been washed away.

Investigators racked their brains to figure out why Brian was so brutally murdered. Could it be linked to Brian's serial cheating?

The subject of the victim’s extramarital affairs came up during investigators’ interview with Robyn who officials recalled appearing “stone faced” and shedding “no tears” as people offered her consolation.

Robyn had an alibi though: She said that on the day her husband went missing she was running errands with her best friend Carol “Sissy” Saltzman who lived with the couple. Robyn then dropped the name of Fannie Dietz one of Brian’s coworkers with whom he was having an affair.

Dietz was brought in for questioning. She was considered a person of interest for a time as was Dietz’s husband who knew about her relationship with Brian and Robyn’s son Justin who didn’t get on well with Brian. Eventually all of them were cleared after investigators dug into their phone records.

Detectives pursued other leads including the Davis' finances — and investigators found plenty of red ink and red flags according to “Killer Motive.”

Brian had a video poker habit that had become such an issue that he had become atypically behind in child-support payments and the mortgage. Robyn meanwhile had her own gambling addiction. In fact instead of attending a post-funeral memorial for her late husband “she was playing video poker” said Rick Bryant Calcasieu Parish District Attorney.

Finances not infidelity could be the motive at the core of the crime investigators theorized. They narrowed the scope of their investigation to focus on the person whose bottom line would most benefit with Brian no longer in the picture.

That individual was Robyn who owned life insurance policies on Brian worth $700000. That set off alarm bells which clanged even louder when detectives dug deeper and found that Robyn collected an insurance payout after her first husband died in a car accident.

As a possible motive for the homicide became clearer investigators learned more about the complex relationship between Robyn and her live-in best friend Saltzman. Both women were terminated from an insurance company after Saltzman was caught stealing money and Robyn failed to speak up about her knowledge of the crime. Getting fired didn’t sever the women’s bond.

“Everywhere Robyn went Sissy was there” said Det. Brent Young of the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office.

That included the interrogation room. Each woman was interviewed on July 13. During separate interrogations the women were caught in lies about their whereabouts on the day of Brian's murder. However neither woman seized an opportunity to throw the other under the bus.

“They were joined at the hip” said an investigator.

After creating a detailed timeline of Robyn and Saltzman’s movements on the day Brian was killed including times of events and vehicles all three were driving investigators had a clear reckoning of the brutal shooting.

They theorized that Saltzman staged the flat tire and Brian was called to go to the scene to help. As he knelt to fix the flat he was shot once and ran for his life but was shot three more times and died. Detectives believe each woman fired the murder weapon linking them in culpability.

Five months after Davis was killed his wife and her best friend were indicted. Prosecutors knew it would be a tough case because the evidence was circumstantial: There was no weapon no DNA no witnesses.

The trial began in April 2012. In plain view during the proceedings the prosecutor displayed the fully inflated tire that Brian drove out to change at the scene that had been staged. On August 26 2012 a jury convicted then 50-year-old Robyn and Saltzman who was 45 at the time of second-degree murder. They were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Both women maintained their innocence at the sentencing. Robyn insisted she would continue to fight for her freedom while Saltzman claimed she would know no peace until the real killer was found reported NBC affiliate KPLC at the time. Most recently in 2019 the two were denied a new trial according to the station.

LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtc3VlZC1mb3ItZmFpbGluZy10by1kZWxpdmVyLWVhcmx5LWJpcmQtY2hlY2staW4tcmVmdXNpbmctcmVmdW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Sued For Denying Early Bird Check-in Then Refusing Refunds,"It’s very difficult to sue an airline thanks to the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act. The law which abolished the federal government’s role in deciding which airlines flew what routes and at what price also pre-empted state regulation of airlines.

It makes sense that you don’t want 50 different sets of regulation for an airline operating within the United States (sometimes airlines even fly to Delaware for completeness). The Supreme Court has ruled that this doesn’t just mean state legislatures can’t impose rules on airline prices and the like but that people cannot pursue ‘state-level contract claims’ in the courts.

In many cases if you want ds to be for violating federal law or its own contract of carriage. In Northwest v. Ginsburg the Supreme Court even said you cannot sue an airline frequent flyer program for breaching a duty of good faith and fair dealing because that too is pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act. I’d love to see someone pursue a case who had earned their miles for non-flight activity and redeemed their miles for non-flight awards.

NV Flyer covers a case where a customer paid for ‘Early Bird Check-in’ in order to board earlier – their flight was cancelled and they were rebooked on another flight they didn’t receive the earlier boarding they paid for (they had to buy it again!) or a refund of their early check-in fee.

Naturally Southwest Airlines argues the case can’t be pursued because it’s pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act. That’s an airline’s first line of defense. They say they didn’t violate their own terms and conditions so pound sand.

However in Klutho v. Southwest Airlines Co. the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri didn’t buy it.

Southwest argued that the ADA preempted the breach of contract claim because it “impermissibly seeks to impose binding standards of conduct on Southwest that operate outside the terms of the Contract of Carriage” which did not refer to the early boarding fee. The plaintiff kept his opposition simple. He argued that (i) his payment of the early boarding fee resulted in a unilateral contract that Southwest breached by failing to provide the early boarding he had paid for (ii) the Contract of Carriage was irrelevant to the unilateral contract and (iii) the ADA did not preempt his contract claim because he “is not trying to expand the terms of the simple contract agreed to” by the parties.

Southwest’s terms were silent on the issue. So the question is simple: did they take money for something and then fail to deliver the service?

Not having the case thrown out isn’t the same thing as winning. But getting a day in court against n airline can be no simple feat. Ultimately this then should come down to what did Southwest Airlines sell to the customer?

Most people think of Early Bird Check-in as ‘getting early boarding’. Southwest Airlines doesn’t assign seats and the reason you want to be higher up in the check-in queue is because that allows you to board earlier and get a more preferred seat.

However it doesn’t literally provide ‘early boarding’ or any specific boarding order. It just means you’re assigned a boarding number after full fare and elite customers but before people who didn’t pay extra and have one assigned when they check in for the flight.

Here it seems the customer bought early check-in their flight was cancelled and that fee wasn’t refunded. They bought early check-in again for their new flights and they want to turn this into a class action suit.

Legally this seems to be just an oversight on Southwest’s part. They could just update their terms and conditions to say that Early Bird check-in is non-refundable even in the case of a cancelled flight and potentially prevail on pre-emption grounds. (Other potential challenges to this policy are beyond the scope of this discussion.)

What’s strange though is that Southwest’s Early Bird Check-in FAQ says that they will refund the fee in the event of a flight cancellation by the airline. Why they apparently did not do so in this case is unclear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zvb2QtYW5kLWRyaW5rcy1oYXdhaWktZmxpZ2h0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flying to Hawaii? Here’s what to expect with inflight food and beverages,"With international travel restrictions still largely preventing Americans from leaving the country many are looking for their next getaway a bit closer to home — and Hawaii naturally fits that bill. Despite some early hiccups the Aloha State has reopened to visitors albeit with some stringent testing and pre-registration requirements to keep COVID-19 under control across the islands.

And while reaching Hawaii from the U.S. mainland is relatively easy the state's location means that you'll still need to spend at least five hours in the air. As a result the food-and-beverage selections on these flights is critical to know if you're planning a trip there.

Here's everything you need to know about what the major U.S. airlines are offering onboard flights to Hawaii right now.

Finally first-class passengers can enjoy the carrier's signature fruit and cheese platter from 5 a.m. through 8 p.m. — though pre-orders are highly recommended which can be done starting two weeks prior to your flight's departure.

Premium Class

If you're flying in Alaska's domestic premium economy product you'll enjoy the same drink selection as first class passengers for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. However your food offerings are limited to the aforementioned fruit and cheese platter — and you're required to pre-order it (up until 20 hours before your flight).

Economy

In regular economy passengers are limited to the same set of non-alcoholic beverages listed above. They can also purchase the fruit and cheese platter and pre-orders are required.

Here's what to expect if you're booked on American to Hawaii.

First and business class

American has resumed serving meals on these flights but they will be served on a single tray rather than courses.

Main Cabin Extra and Main Cabin

Service in both Main Cabin Extra and regular economy will be much more limited consisting of pretzels or Biscoff cookies along with a choice of water canned drinks or juice. No alcohol is served and there's no additional food for purchase.

Delta Airlines

At the time of writing Delta is offering the following flights from the U.S. to Hawaii:

Honolulu is currently served from Atlanta (ATL) Los Angeles (LAX) Minneapolis (MSP) Salt Lake City (SLC) and Seattle (SEA).

Kahului Maui is currently served from Los Angeles (LAX) Salt Lake City (SLC) and Seattle (SEA).

Lihue Kauai and Kailua Kona are both currently served from Los Angeles (LAX) and Seattle (SEA).

Here's what to expect if you're booked on Delta to Hawaii.

Delta One and first class

Passengers traveling in first class on most flights to Hawaii will be limited to 8.5-ounce bottles of water along with complimentary wine and beer. Unfortunately the food offerings are limited to individually-packaged Flight Fuel boxes and other snacks.

Note that Delta's website says that all domestic flights follow this service model. However reports indicate that the carrier's two longest flights flights to Honolulu — out of Atlanta and Minneapolis — are being treated like long-haul international routes in Delta One including a hot meal and a full selection of beverage options.

Comfort+ and Main Cabin

Travelers in Comfort+ and regular economy on most flights will have notably slimmer service — just bottled water and two prepackaged snacks. However on flights from Atlanta and Minneapolis to Honolulu Comfort+ and economy passengers will still enjoy a meal and beverage service.

At the time of writing Hawaiian is offering the following flights from the U.S. to Hawaii:

Honolulu (HNL) is currently served from Boston (BOS) Las Vegas (LAS) Long Beach (LGB) Los Angeles (LAX) New York-JFK Oakland (OAK) Phoenix (PHX) Portland (PDX) Sacramento (SMF) San Francisco (SFO) San Jose (SJC) and Seattle (SEA). In addition it plans to launch nonstop flights to Orlando (MCO) and Austin (AUS) in March and April respectively.

Kahului Maui (OGG) is currently served from Los Angeles Oakland Portland Sacramento San Francisco San Jose and Seattle — and flights are scheduled to relaunch from Long Beach and Las Vegas in March and April respectively.

Lihue Kauai (LIH) doesn't have any current service on Hawaiian — though flights are scheduled to relaunch from Los Angeles and Oakland in April.

Kailua Kona (KOA) doesn't have any current service on Hawaiian — though flights are scheduled to relaunch from Los Angeles in April.

Here's what to expect if you're booked on Hawaiian Airlines to the Aloha State.

First class

For starters Hawaiian has pushed pre-departure beverage service in first class to take place shortly after takeoff — to minimize mask removal while economy passengers are boarding. In addition beverages are limited to canned and bottled selections on all flights other than the long-haul departures to/from Boston and New York-JFK — where poured beverages remain an option.

For meals Hawaiian is taking a similar approach as American: All first-class passengers will still enjoy full meal service but on a single tray rather than in courses.

Economy class

Passengers in the main cabin will receive complimentary bottled water but are limited to canned and bottled beverages on all West Coast departures and arrivals (long-haul flights to/from Boston and New York-JFK can still receive poured beverages). All travelers — regardless of flight length — will still receive a complimentary sandwich though these are pre-packaged and vary depending on the time and direction of travel (more details at this link).

Southwest Airlines

At the time of writing Southwest is offering the following flights from the U.S. to Hawaii:

Lihue Kauai (LIH) doesn't have any current service on Southwest — though flights are scheduled to commence from Oakland and San Jose in June.

Kailua Kona (KOA) is currently served from both Oakland and San Jose.

Southwest usually offers limited snacks and beverages on its planes but this has been slimmed down even more due to the pandemic. All flights across the carrier's network that cover more than 250 miles — including those to Hawaii — only serve water and snacks. There's no alcohol service at all. As a result you'll want to bring your own food and drinks on your Southwest flights to Hawaii.

United Airlines

At the time of writing United is offering the following flights from the U.S. to Hawaii:

Honolulu (HNL) is currently served from Chicago-O'Hare (ORD) Denver (DEN) Houston (IAH) Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) — with flights from Newark (EWR) and Washington-Dulles (IAD) scheduled to relaunch in March and April respectively.

Kailua Kona (KOA) is currently served from Denver Los Angeles and San Francisco — with flights from Chicago-O'Hare scheduled to launch in June.

Hilo (ITO) doesn't currently have any United flights but service is planned from Los Angeles starting March 4.

Here's what to expect if you're booked on United to Hawaii.

First class

Travelers in United's premium cabins will enjoy complimentary beverages — including beer wine and liquor — on all flights to and from Hawaii. For food all first-class passengers will receive a choice of a sandwich and one of the carrier's snack boxes. However for Hawaii flights departing from or arriving into Chicago Denver Houston Newark and Washington-Dulles you'll also receive a main meal (on one tray) along with a selection from a pre-arrival snack basket.

Economy class

If you're booked in United economy you'll enjoy a selection of complimentary non-alcoholic sealed beverages — though no alcohol is available to purchase. You'll also receive a pre-packaged snack bag with a wrapped sanitizer wipe a bottle of water and two snacks.

However a recent report from Live and Let's Fly indicates that as of Mar. 4 United will once again begin offering limited buy-on-board options for economy-class passengers on the following routes:

Chicago-O'Hare to/from Honolulu

Chicago-O'Hare to/from Kahului Maui

Houston to/from Honolulu

Newark to/from Honolulu

It's unclear whether this will be similar to the Denver relaunch of buy-on-board snacks beer and wine from last November but it's certainly an upgrade to the carrier's in-flight offerings — though may lead to more maskless time for passengers.

We've reached out to United for further clarification and will update this story if we receive any additional details.

Bottom line

No one likes taking a five-plus hour flight with limited food-and-beverage options but the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has made that a necessity. If you're booked on a flight to or from Hawaii in the near future be sure to carefully review what your given airline is offering along these lines — and then plan ahead to avoid being hungry (or thirsty) upon arrival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91cy1haXJsaW5lLW1lcmdlcnMtb3Zlci10aGUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Has The US Seen So Many Airline Mergers Over The Years?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS91cy1haXJsaW5lLW1lcmdlcnMtb3Zlci10aGUteWVhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzM5MzYzL3RoZXJlcy1hLWJvZWluZy03MzctZm9yLXNhbGUtb24tZmFjZWJvb2stZm9yLXRoZS1wcmljZS1vZi1hLW5ldy1mZXJyYXJp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a Boeing 737 For Sale on Facebook for the Price of a New Ferrari,"​Let’s pretend for a moment that you’re in the market for a new Ferrari SF90 Stradale which costs upwards of half a million dollars. But then something catches your eye: a vintage 1996 Boeing 737-300 airframe you could purchase for roughly the same cost and maybe even a little less. A seller in the Aircraft Salvage-Sales/Swap Facebook group is actively looking for a buyer for the decommissioned plane.

The 737 is wrapped and ready in San Bernardino County California and appears to be in fine shape. It’s a Southwest Boeing 737-300 with tail number N601WN and is emblazoned with the words “The Jack Vidal” after Southwest Airlines’ first vice president of maintenance. Vidal served the company for 24 years and the company dedicated this plane in his name in 1995.

Georgy Snezhko/Facebook

Before you get too excited you might want to read the fine print: “can fly immediately when buyer finds CFM56 3C1/3B1 engines for it.” Aircraft engines aren’t cheap by any measure and new ones will cost you millions of dollars more. As an example in a press release from 2011 Rolls Royce announced the sale of 12 Trent 1000 engines for eight Boeing Dreamliners for Ethiopian Airlines at about $42 million per engine including service. There are a number of sites all over the internet selling refurbished engines but finding the price is difficult unless you’re a serious buyer. There’s no mention of the condition of the tires and if it needs replacements those will set you back at least $1500 each.

People have turned airframes like this into some interesting buildings like the 747 house in California. If you haven’t caught the Netflix special on how that was built add that to your list because it’s fascinating. There’s a guy who gutted a 727 to live inside and even kept the original lavatory. Another who is transforming a 737 into a mobile home. And in Colorado Springs a former pilot transformed a Boeing KC-97 U.S. Air Force Aircraft into The Airplane Restaurant.

If you’re still set on buying the Jack Vidal maybe see if the seller would consider a swap for your house or supercar. Make sure your seats and table trays are in the upright position for take-off and good luck.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdW5pdGVkLWZsaWdodC0zMjgtZW5naW5lLWZhaWx1cmUtMDQxNDI4ODY5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Flight 328 Engine Failure: US Takes Regulatory Action Against Boeing 777; Japan Suspends Use,"Washington February 22: Days after United Flight 328 had to make an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport owing to engine failure Boeing Co 777 faces regulatory actions in the USA.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.











4 Acquisition & integration-related costs primarily relate to the MTD and Excel acquisitions including costs to integrate the organizations and

shared processes as well as harmonize key IT applications and infrastructure.

Japan has been catching on to the convenience–and importance–of reusable coffee cups in recent years and if anyone needed any more convincing to make the switch over from disposable cups this new product from Starbucks ought to do it.

Simply called the Drink Hole Cap this adorable little bear is designed to sit inside the hole on the lid of your coffee cup protecting you from spills on the table or while out on the go in a car or on the street.

However the Bearista cap is not sold separately. It can only be purchased as a set with a reusable cup for a very reasonable 500 yen (US$4.72).

People who bring the cup to Starbucks for refills are also eligible for a discount making this even more great value for money. Our resident Starbucks expert K.Masami who’s been known to spill drinks on occasion was thrilled to get one of these when they were released on 17 February and immediately put it to good use showing us just how well it works.

▼ All you have to do is fill the cup and pop the lid on then drink as you would normally through the mouth hole.

Once you’ve had enough liquid to satisfy your thirst for a while it’s time to take out the little bear who comes cutely dressed in a Starbucks barista apron.

Here to serve the bear will happily plug right into the mouth hole keeping the beverage nice and warm and protecting you from any spillages as well.

▼ Ta daaa〜!

Honestly how cute is this? It’s not just great for practicality it’s fantastic to look at too and Masami couldn’t help but smile every time she looked at her little bear friend.

She even tipped the cup over on a slight angle to see if anything would leak out but the Bearista firmly held everything in. She then went and took the little bear out for a ride in the car and sure enough there wasn’t a speck of spilled liquid to be seen anywhere.

Needless to say Masami is now madly in love and won’t be going on anymore Starbucks runs without her little bear.

This cute set is only available until stocks run out so be sure to get in quick if you want to enjoy the company of a bear like Masami’s. And while you’re there don’t forget there are plenty of limited-edition sakura goods and drinks in stores for a limited time too!

Ever since the Starbucks Roastery opened in Tokyo we’ve been treated to all sorts of ultra-exclusive goods and menu items that you just can’t buy anywhere else. This year the megastore is continuing the trend for cherry blossom season and they’ve gone all out with the sakura celebrations giving us everything from stylish tumblers through to sakura cocktails baked goods and even delicate jewellery.

There’s a lot of gorgeous goods to choose from this year so without further ado let’s take a look at what’s on offer starting with the exclusive drinkware collection.

Starbucks Reserve mug sakura (355 milliliters) 3000 yen Starbucks Reserve stainless tumbler sakura (473 milliliters) 4400 yen Starbucks Reserve double-wall glass pink sakura (296 milliliters) 3200 yen Starbucks Reserve leather key chain pink cherry 3000 yen Starbucks Reserve cooler bag navy 3200 yen Starbucks Reserve northeast cotton rug cherry 5500 yen

The above items are available at Starbucks Roastery Tokyo where customers can purchase up to 10 items per person and Starbucks Reserve stores where customers will be limited to one of each product on the first day of sales.

The following items however can only be purchased at the Starbucks Roastery Tokyo:

Starbucks Reserve Roastery stainless steel strap bottle sakura (355 milliliters) 4600 yen Starbucks Reserve Roastery handle glass sakura (355 milliliters) 2800 yen Starbucks Reserve Roastery pleated mug sakura 2021 pink (355 milliliters) 3000 yen

The Roastery Tokyo will have even more exclusive sakura items including some cherry blossom jewelry.

Seen in the image above (left to right) are:

Starbucks Reserve bracelet (Colors: Silver/Pink Gold/Gold) 13000 yen each

Starbucks Reserve necklace (Colors: Silver/Pink Gold/Gold) 15000 yen each

Starbucks Reserve Roastery pleated mug cherry 2021 Navy (355 milliliters) 3000 yen

The above items are available until sold out. Up to 10 items can be purchased per person with customers limited to one Starbucks Reserve Bracelet/Necklace per person on the first day of sale then up to 10 items per person after release day.

It’s not just goods on offer either as the menu will be blooming with pink treats as well. As in previous years the Roastery Tokyo will have some exclusive sakura tipples spread out over the different bars on site. At the main bar on the ground floor there’ll be the Sakura Macchiato (900 yen) which includes a strawberry cream topping and a pale pink color to resemble “a cherry blossom in full bloom dancing on the wind”.

At the first-floor Teavana bar customers can get a taste of the following tea-infused beverages which have been appearing on the menu in previous years: Blossoming Sakura (800 yen) Sakura Allure Cascade (950 yen) and Teavana Cream Soda Sakura (900 yen).

And up on the second floor Arriviamo bar customers can enjoy the Starbucks Reserve Sakura Cask Coffee (2000 yen) a cocktail inspired by the cherry blossom copper cask seen at the coffee roasting area on-site and the Ruby Berry Blossom (2000 yen).

▼ Sakura Cask Coffee

▼ Ruby Berry Blossom

Over at the Roastery’s Princi bakery there’ll be a variety of baked goods celebrating the blossoms as well with special sakura-infused Italian treats like (below left to right): sakura cupola (380 yen) sakura cornetti (420 yen) sakura torta (720 yen) and sakura maritozzo (420 yen).

That’s a whole lot of sakura to eat drink and collect and you’ll only have a short time to do it all too as the exclusive goods and menu items will only be available for a limited time until sold out. And over at regular Starbucks stores there’s a whole other collection of limited-edition cherry blossom drinks and goods to entice you as well!

CLOUD STATE,The University of Minnesota Duluth men's basketball team left it all out on the floor in a losing effort today in St. Cloud Minn. The Huskies would go on to defeat the Bulldogs 91-86. UMD finishes the season 6-7 overall and (5-7) in the NSIC.The majority of the first half of play was back and forth between the Bulldogs and the Huskies with both teams going on short runs and grabbing a small lead then relinquishing it to their opponents within the next few positions. It wasn't until about four minutes left in the first half when the Huskies went on a late half run to give themselves a seven point lead at the break. The Bulldogs shot 15-31 (48.6%) from the field in the first half and 4-12 (33.3) from beyond the long line. The Huskies would shoot 16-29 (55.2%) from the field and 9-17 (52.9%) from beyond the arc.In the second half St. Cloud State continued their hot shooting early in the half. The Huskies grew their lead to 15 points multiple times in the second half  but the Bulldogs weren't done just yet. With the Bulldogs pressing the Huskies while inbounding and preventing the Huskies from advancing the ball up the floor UMD was able to cause chaos resulting in multiple turnovers that would eventually lead to baskets. UMD was able to use this momentum to chip the St. Cloud State lead down to just four points late in the second half but could never climb all the way back before succumbing to defeat. Overall UMD shot 33-68 (48.5%) from the field and 11-32 (34.4%) from beyond the arc.Again all of the UMD starting five got in on the scoring fun with all five starters scoring double digits.

Deion Sanders' debut as Jackson State football coach looked like reason for celebration.

After their fall season was delayed because of COVID-19 the Tigers opened the Prime Time era with a 53-0 win over Edward Waters on Sunday. Prior to the game Sanders got a visit from former Dallas Cowboys teammate and fellow football Hall of Famer Troy Aikman that Sanders said moved him to tears.

All seemed well in western Mississippi. That is until Sanders' postgame news conference.

Sanders: I was robbed

The first-year head coach was happy with his team's performance. But he told reporters he was robbed of his cellphone watches and credit cards during the game.

Coach Prime said someone stole all of the belongings in his office during the game. pic.twitter.com/HEMRLv7IgI — Rashad Milligan (@RashadMilligan) February 21 2021

""No. 1 the kids played really well"" Sanders said. ""But while the game was going on somebody came in and stole every darn thing I had in the locker room coaches' office. Credit cards wallet watches. Thank God I had on my necklaces.

""How?!""

Sanders calls out Jackson State security

Sanders then took a moment to collect himself before adding Jackson State security to the areas in need of improvement under his watch.

""So when I have to talk about quality raising the standards — that goes for everyone man"" Sanders continued. ""Not just the people on the field not just the coaches not just the teachers not just the faculty. But everybody — security and everybody.

""So how do you think it feels coming back after just teary-eyed because the guys had presented me with the game ball one of the best moments I've ever had in my professional sports career emotionally. And then you go into your locker room your coach's office to digress and you notice that you don't even have a phone to call your mama call your girl call your kids because it's been stolen. ... We're gonna find out who did it.""

A win in Deion Sanders' Jackson State debut was overshadowed by accusations of theft and lying. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

Property recovered ... was it all a misunderstanding?

Then seemingly good news broke with a Jackson State official telling reporters that Sanders' property wasn't stolen but ""misplaced"" and ""secured"" by a JSU staffer per reports. Sanders got his stuff back.

Except Sanders wasn't having it. He responded to a report on Twitter with an explanation that his assistant caught the alleged thief in the act and that there was ""no miscommunication my man at all.""

Naw it was stolen but they got it back. It was stolen out my personal bag in my office and My assistant caught the gentleman in the process of stealing it but she was alone. No Miscommunication my man at all https://t.co/foXTKwqsQC — COACH PRIME (@DeionSanders) February 22 2021

He then declared that the source who said there was no theft was ""lying"" and reiterated that one of his staffers witnessed the alleged theft.

Whomever putting out the lie that my belongings wasn’t stolen is LYING. My belongings were taken out of a zipped bag in my office and more items were taken as well from my office. We have retrieved them since being reported. My Staff member witnessed the crime. #Truth — COACH PRIME (@DeionSanders) February 22 2021

Lies. It was stolen because a staff member walked in on the theft being committed but she couldn’t fight a dude off. https://t.co/SByAPPPH1H — COACH PRIME (@DeionSanders) February 22 2021

Bad news at Jackson St. either way

Sanders' arrival at Jackson State was expected to shine a spotlight on the program. But this is obviously not the publicity the university had in mind when hiring the flamboyant Hall of Fame cornerback.

For now the best-case scenario has Sanders mistakenly accusing somebody on campus of theft and implying a cover-up that appears to be pointed at Jackson State. At worst somebody did actually attempt to steal Sanders' property before being caught.

Either way it's enough to cast an ominous shadow on what was otherwise a day of celebration in Jackson.

There are many roadside attractions across the state of Minnesota.



One in St. Peter has a heavenly connection: St. Peter’s Pearly Gates.

The idea came from a banker in town 15 years ago. He wanted to put up the pearly gates hoping to bring more people to St. Peter.

It became a reality with the help of a fundraiser. The city donated land in Levee Park along the Minnesota River. For many in town the gates have truly been a godsend.

""Build it and they will come"" Ed Lee with the St. Peter Chamber of Commerce said. ""People from far and near love the pearly gates.""

People from around the nation and world have come to St. Peter to take a picture in front of the pearly gates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oaXN0b3J5LzIwMjEvMDIvMjEvc3QtYXVndXN0aW5lLWhpc3RvcnktZmlzaC1pc2xhbmRzLW5hbWVzYWtlLWhhZC10cm91YmxlZC1wYXN0LzY3OTk1ODEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Augustine History: Fish Island's namesake had a troubled past,"No commitment required.

The company will provide its Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) base kit which includes an open-architecture processor that integrates vehicle sensors and countermeasures in a common framework to detect track and defeat rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles.

""Lockheed Martin partnered with the U.S. Army in 2014 to develop MAPS as a safe and secure vehicle defense system that protects warfighters from a variety of anti-armor threats"" said David Rohall program manager for Advanced Ground Vehicle Systems at Lockheed Martin. ""Since then the MAPS base kit has proven itself in multiple live-fire demonstrations. We’re ready to support integration and testing on a variety of Army combat vehicles the final step before the Army makes a formal decision on fielding this capability.""

Under the 36-month contract Lockheed Martin will deliver five production-ready base kits with an option for up to 20 and support Army integration and testing on Abrams Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle Bradley and Stryker vehicles. The contract also covers developing base kit support for vehicle protection capabilities beyond active protection such as underbelly blast protection the company said.

According to the company's announcement Lockheed Martin’s MAPS base kit which supports the rapid integration of MAPS-compliant sensors and countermeasures is designed to protect current combat vehicles and support future vehicle protection system capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Power study,"T-Mobile has just landed on the top spot of a survey on Mobile Purchase Experience.

As reported by J.D. Power more than three in ten consumers (or 31%) of customers who purchased mobile service from a network operator in the past three months say that it is not so easy to understand plan features and pricing. And this plays a vital role in consumers’ overall mobile purchase experience.

But when it comes to T-Mobile consumers say that they offer the best mobile purchase experience. T-Mobile even scored 813 points out of 1000 points from J.D. Power’s survey. This was followed by AT&T (780 points) Verizon Wireless (744 points) and Sprint (725 points).

In addition to T-Mobile’s success its own prepaid brand Metro by T-Mobile stood as a leader among mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) included in the study. Metro by T-Mobile scored 834 points followed by Spectrum Mobile (826 points) Xfinity Mobile (824 points) Cricket Wireless (816 points) and Boost Mobile (814 points).

The study reported that Consumer Cellular was the leader among MVNOs with 882 points the highest score from three categories. It was then followed by Tracfone (846 points) and Straight Talk (816 points).

The big winners from J.D. Power research is no surprise since they have been leading names in previous surveys. Last year T-Mobile was named as the top ranking full-service carrier with 848 points. Metro by T-Mobile also took the spot as the top ranking non-contract full-service carrier with 821 points. And finally Consumer Cellular was named as the top non-contract value carrier with 888 points.

A link to the video is here .

UPDATE 2:45 PM: The original video was removed from YouTube but staff writer Tim Cantu re-uploaded it here.

The following is a complete transcript of Mather’s remarks:

Kevin Mather: I can only assume there are fans amongst the BBRC since every spring either I or Jerry come over and answer questions and the questions this group asks are of the highest quality.

I thought I’d ramble a little bit...My next meeting is at 10 so as people drop off I’ll answer questions until we’re done.

There’s really three topics:

I’m going to touch briefly on 2020 and what the 2020 experience was like.

[I’ll] Briefly tell you what 2021 will look like because my guess is that’ll change.

And then to end on a high note I’ll tell you about the team and where I think we are.

2020: A terrible year financially we played 60 games no fans. We had forest fire smoke so bad that we played 5 of our home games on the road. But I’m reminded of two things:

No one cares if wealthy sports team owners lose money. Shut up and move on. I’m reminded of a Tiger Woods putt those of you who are golfers will know what I’m talking about...Tiger hits this long putt down the hill and the announcer says “That’s pretty good...Better than most…” and the putt falls in and the crowd goes crazy. Why do I think of that “better than most” commercial? Because as bad as our year was financially in 2020 we were better than most. I attribute that to better lucky than good. It was a low year we were at the very bottom of our rebuild step-back cycle so our payroll was as low as it was going to get. We also have a television deal with ROOT sports and we punch well above our weight on the television deal. We had 60 games and per game we got a lot more than we probably deserved compared to other similar sized markets. Terrible year financially but we did better than most.

Second thing and last thing I’ll say about 2020...When we decided to play 60 games every team was allowed 60 players to bring to spring training summer camp. You’d have 26-28 on your major league roster and 30-32 players on your taxi squad...They weren’t in a bubble but they were in a bubble...We made the decision when we invited the 60 players to invite 15 prospects. Our top prospects were all in Tacoma summer camp was 30 days and then Tacoma was a 60-day practice/exhibition game. We brought 18 19 20 year old kids who never would have seen T-Mobile Park or Cheney Stadium if not for COVID. As devastating as 2020 was on player development and getting better we took a risk and brought our high-end prospects in really got to know them they got high-end instruction in Tacoma. The risk was if our major league team had had a COVID outbreak or injuries and we had to call people up from the taxi squad we were a little short on players. Because there was no chance you were going to see these young players at T-Mobile Park. We weren’t going to put them on the 40-man roster we weren’t going to start the service time clock. There were all kinds of reasons that if we had an injury problem or COVID outbreak you might’ve seen my big tummy out there in left field. You would not have seen our prospects playing in T-Mobile Park.

The risk paid off we had a great year in development for 15 of our prospects. As the season went on other general managers around the league realized they missed an opportunity they went to the commissioner and asked to expand the taxi squads add 10 more people...The commissioner pondered it for a few days and concluded it wasn’t worth the risk. So I’d like to thank Jerry Dipoto and the baseball department but on the bright side of 2020 we did better than most clubs on player development.

Let’s move on to 2021...I’m going to end this the same way we started. I’m embarrassed to tell you that spring training starts on February 17th. Pitchers and catchers report to Arizona the state with the highest COVID infection rate in the union but on February 17th pitchers and catchers will report. There’s a new spring training schedule coming out don’t buy your plane ticket quite yet. One the schedule’s going to change and two it’s not clear we can have fans in Peoria Arizona.

Seventy-five players will be invited to spring training no minor league spring training until the major league team leaves to start the season. So minor league spring training will start in April after the major league team comes to T-Mobile Park [to[ reduce the risk of infection. Our opening day is April 1st we will play a 162 game season as normal as normal can be. Our interleague opponent is the NL West. There will be no expanded playoffs no DH in the National League no seven=inning double headers no runner on second base in extra innings. Yes the union and MLB could not come to an agreement to push the season back. We tried to push the season back a month so players would be vaccinated start the season in early May play a 154 game season we could not come to an agreement...That is also embarrassing.

Finally on a high note I’m going to talk about the team. We think we are in a fantastic spot. We believe the AL West is on its way down we believe the Mariners are on the way up this could be a lot of fun for a lot of years. 2021 is probably a stretch as far as making the playoffs but a few highlights:

At first base we have Evan White a gold glove first baseman. He struggled at the plate last year statistically but the analytics department will tell you he’s a fantastic hitter he hit the ball hard and had a lot of bad luck snakebites last year. He’s going to be a good hitter. Don’t worry about Evan White.

Dylan Moore will be at second base or our utility player perhaps left field in April. We are trying to sign a second baseman as we speak.

J.P. Crawford is a Gold Glove shortstop.

Kyle Seager this is probably his last season as a Mariner. He will and I’ve already told him he’ll be a Mariners Hall of Famer when he’s done playing. Last year he seemed to find the Fountain of Youth had a fantastic year and we expect the same in 2021.

We traded with the Padres last July and picked up a catcher named Luis Torres [sic]. Luis Torres [sic] is a fantastic catcher he’s young and he’s controllable and he had such a good breakout with the Seattle Mariners that our minor league catcher of the future Cal Raleigh he was going to go home at the end of September but decided to stay and go down to Arizona work in the camp because he realized that his playing time might be shortchange by Luis Torres [sic].

We picked up Ty France in the Padres trade third base/DH/second base/first base.

I really want to remind everybody of Mitch Haniger. Mitch Haniger was an All-Star in 2018 was off to a great start in 2019 had a devastating injury has been out for 19 and 20. He’s healthy he’s in the best shape of his life he’ll be in right field and I have no doubt an All-Star in 2021. Mitch Haniger has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder as we talk about our prospects and these young kids. He’s mentioned more than once what about me?

In center field we have Kyle Lewis. He was the Rookie of the Year last year Kyle Lewis is a great human being and Kyle Lewis will push himself to get better.

On the pitching staff we have Marco Gonzales signed to a long-term deal. Marco Gonzales is very quietly very boring but Marco Gonzales might be the second- or third-best left-handed starter in the American League. He has very quietly put up fantastic numbers.

Justus Sheffield is also a starting pitcher for us. He would have been the Rookie of the Year if not for Kyle Lewis taking the award for us. I enjoyed whispering that in his ear as we made a presentation on the field last September.

Kikuchi our Japanese pitcher was much better last year. His numbers didn’t show it but he’ll be one of our starting pitchers. We’ll run a six man rotation like we did last year and we’re in the process of trying to sign yet another starting pitcher in the next week or so. [n.b. Subsequent to this speech the Mariners signed James Paxton to a one-year contract.]

We’ve made several additions to our bullpen.

On the minor league side Jarred Kelenic we’ve been talking about him for a year and a half now. He’ll be in left field in April. He’s a 21-year-old player who um is quite confident. We offered him a long-term deal six-year deal for substantial money with options to go farther. After pondering it for several days and talking to the union he’s turned us down and in his words he’s going to bet on himself. He thinks after six years he’ll be such a star player that the 7th 8th 9th year options will be under value. He might be right he might be right we offered and he turned us down.

On the mound in April you won’t see him on April 1st but by mid April you’ll see a young man named Logan Gilbert. He’s the real deal he’s a top of the rotation pitcher and I can’t wait to see him at T-Mobile Park.

I mentioned Cal Raleigh Cal Raleigh is our catching prospect he’ll be here some time in 2021. He’s a switch-hitting catcher and we think very highly of him he and Luis Torres [sic] will probably share the duty for the next six years.

Finally in the San Diego trade we picked up a young man named Taylor Trammell. The first time I met him I thought he was in the wrong field he looked like a tight end for the Seahawks. He’s 6’4” 220 lbs. chiseled and he’s an outfielder that will be here in 2021 probably the back half of the season.

The point of all this: We have very highly thought of young players that will be here in 2021 and as they learn and grow we think the back half of 2021 will be better than the front half of 2021. Before I close...we started the step back plan in August of 2018. We have gathered prospects. It’s been an expensive and I know painful process for our fan base. But we have in the top 100 [of] Baseball America...Now when you’re lousy in your minor leagues you dismiss Baseball America and say you know we’ll see what happens kids change [and] kids grow up but since we have six of the top 100 we don’t dismiss it. We speak quite highly of it. There’s 30 teams in baseball and the Mariners have six of the top 100 I can do the math on that; we’re doing quite well. We actually have two in the top 10. These players arrive in 21 22 23 which gets to my point: I think this is going to be a lot of fun for a long time.

We will offer long term contracts we did a long term deal with Marco Gonzales. We did a long term deal with Evan White...when I say long term deal he had not played a game in Major League Baseball and we signed him to a $24 million contract overpaying him in year one two and three. Fair in years four five and six. And then if he’s a superstar we have the option to exercise and keep him in years seven eight and nine. Weep not for Evan White but if he’s a superstar we’re only gonna pay him $15 or $16 million a year [while] on the free agent market he might get $20 to $24 million a year. So we took the risk in the early years and he took the risk that he’s a superstar in the later years of his contract and he’s probably underpaid. He took a lot of heat for signing that deal the union really pushed back and said don’t do it. But I like Evan White he’s a nice young man and he made the comment he said “I have $23 million guaranteed. That changes a person’s life. I’m signing the deal. And if I’m good and they pick up my options I’ll have $55 million guaranteed. That changes my family’s my grandkids’ lives.” I like the young man. We will offer more long term deals.

And there’s a certain pitcher that I won’t mention who was in the bullpen at T-Mobile Park during our summer camp. And this was reported by one of the coaches. The players were sitting around talking about Evan White and you know he made a mistake signing this long term deal and delta. And this particular pitcher who is going to be here in 2022 he said “If somebody offers me $23 million guaranteed find me a pen as fast as you can I’m signing.” So we’re going to do that our ownership is committed we’re eager to sign these players up [and] we’re willing to take that risk. Some we’ll win on some we’ll lose on but we’re going to try to get three or four more players signed on these long term deals over the next two years.

Finally in closing I think we’re on the verge of something special. I know our fans have been patient I know our fans are frustrated they have stuck with us. They have been loyal and they deserve a winning team. We’re going to get there and it’s not going to be a one year...we’ve got talent stacked up and spread out and at various ages and levels in our minor leagues that we think we can consistently win. We also have an ownership group that is committed to winning and they will spend money...when we need to go get a starting pitcher or a free agent left fielder we’ll go do that. So we’re very much looking forward to delivering to our fan base.

I close with: The Seahawks won the Super Bowl good for them. Fantastic. And they had a heck of a parade. Bob opened with the story of the Twins and the World Series we had a parade in Minnesota and when you win a World Series it’s a month long process. There’s a best-of-five series best-of-seven series best-of-seven series and it goes for a month. So when we win the World Series as much as I liked the Seahawks parade and then winning the Super Bowl that parade will look like a neighborhood Fourth of July parade because when we win this World Series we’re going to do it right and I’m looking forward to delivering. With that this group always has great questions.

Question: What about getting to go to games and if people can go to games are they going to have to wear a mask for three or four hours outdoors?

KM: It’s a question I don’t know the answer to. We have worked closely with the city the county the health officials. The Seahawks tried to get fans for their playoff game. And I told my staff I said let’s just pull their coat and stay out of this one. And they were not able to do it. We have designs socially distanced T-Mobile Park will hold 9870 fans. The real question is do we have to stay away from the field do we have to be back six rows? And those are pods of four. I’m afraid one of the issues the county is going to have us do at least in April and perhaps May is the pot of four has to be from the same household. And how do we enforce that? We’re working closely with the county health officials. Some ballparks will have fans. Texas Florida they will have fans and not as socially distanced as perhaps we will be at T-Mobile Park. The state of California we don’t think they’re going to have fans all year. So we’re working on it. My best guess is small in April bigger in May bigger in June perhaps big crowds in July August and let’s hope in September we’re pushing for a playoff spot and we have big crowds in September. That’s my guess that it’ll phase in and my guess is mask[s] will probably be mandatory in the first half. But that’s all you know I’m still hoping to have fans in Arizona. And that’s the end of the month.

We talked to the national health officials. I’m not supposed to say his name but the commissioner talked to Dr. Fauci. And if we could have pushed spring training back a month Dr. Fauci thought that the players would be vaccinated before they left at the end of April and we could start early May and have our players vaccinated. We could not come to an agreement on [that].

Q: Kevin what was the players union’s position on why they didn’t want to move back spring training?

KM: Um it’s an interesting question. The players are worried that they won’t get paid. We offered to play 154 games there would have been some doubleheaders and they would have been seven inning doubleheaders on Saturdays play 154 games we [would have] pa[id] them for 162 games. There is a chance the commissioner can cancel the season he can cancel games he can cancel the season he has that authority. Let’s say the South African COVID virus which is getting people’s attention comes to the United States takes over and we have to shut down. Airplanes are grounded. At that point the commissioner is going to have to cancel at least a certain number of baseball games. And as he told me the other day he said “If we played a 10-game season and I tell the owners that they have to pay the players for 162 games I better have my resume updated.” The players wanted to guarantee 162 games and the commissioner basically said that’s a non starter...There is a high level of distrust between the Union and the management currently and I’m very worried about what’s coming in the future. Good question. I could go on and get into more details on that.

Q: What are the odds we see Paxton or Walker?

KM: Um it’s a good question Paxton has surprisingly not signed...We are of the opinion the industry lost $2.9 billion dollars and before any of you make faces: No nobody cares that rich owners lost money. But we lost $2.9 billion last year and we have taken the position that there are 180 free agents still out there on February 5 unsigned and sooner or later these players are going to turn their hat over and come with hat in hand looking for a contract. We think Walker is one of them. James Paxton made $12.5 million dollars last year and his agent has told us that he’s going to make more in 2021. Interestingly we started a conversation with Paxton yesterday and it is for substantially less than he made. There’s a chance. We’re having conversations and Walker thinks he’s going to get a three-year deal. I don’t think he’s going to get a three-year deal and there’s a chance he comes back as well. When I said we’re looking to get another starting pitcher you just named two that we are in the early stages of talking to but February 17 is fast approaching.

Q: I’m a little confused about the Kelenic kid. My recollection is that he’s a top prospect we have out there and I’m a little confused about your statements about them earlier. It sounded like you wasn’t happy with [the] contract opportunity long term. Is he in the system is he going to be in the system or is is he actually gone or going?

KM: He’s in our minor league system...In 2019 we promoted him to AA. He is a very good player. And quite frankly we think he’s going to be a superstar. We control his major league career for six years. And after six years he’ll be a free agent. We would like him to get a few more at-bats in the minor leagues. Probably AAA Tacoma for a month and then he will likely be in left field at T-Mobile {ark for the next six or seven years and then he’ll be a free agent...He won’t commit beyond his free agent years. I wouldn’t say he’s unhappy he appreciates the offer he just refused to sign it. He thinks he’s going to be that good. And he thinks he will be a very well-paid player after six years and I think he might be right. Hopefully with us but we’ll see where we end up...he’s not unhappy I guess I would say he’s unhappy that he hasn’t played at T-Mobile Park but he thought he should have been in left field at T-Mobile Park three years ago. I mean he does not lack confidence.

Moderator: Kevin thank you for your presentation again today. It’s always interesting to get an update from you on how the favorite team is doing here. So in honor of your presentation and through the generosity of Cashman Consulting and Jeff Cashman we are donating 1000 pounds of fresh produce to Harvest Against Hunger.

KM: Thank you for your interest. We really appreciate that there’s an interest out there we think we’re in a really good spot and we’re excited about the future thing and I’m really looking forward to the next spring when I tell you who we signed and how many games we’re gonna win.

Moderator: I know it’s been a tough year for the Mariners and I think this quote is really appropriate to all of us: When you come to a fork in the road. Take it. And this is a very famous quote from Yogi Berra so hopefully the road that we take will be better for all of us [in] 2021 and beyond. So with that we are adjourned. And I’ll turn it back over to you guys for more questions.]

Q: Despite all the obvious trying times in 2020 you shared that one story about the young player saying hey you know give me $23 million and I’ll sign. Can you think of any other positive leadership stories that came out of a weird year in a weird season?

KM: Marco Gonzales has really taken a leadership role. One good story in 2019 we had a veteran pitcher that we have since traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks (if you want to figure out who it is) who had a you know attitude. He’d been around he’d been there done that. And our bullpen coach was talking to the starting pitchers in spring training; he was talking about you know when you go out and throw your bullpens you know it’s only 20 pitches [so] let’s make sure it’s quality and he was giving this speech. And the pitcher who’s no longer with us kind of rolled his eyes and said “Don’t tell me how to throw my bullpens yet.” As the meeting broke up Marco Gonzales with a help of a couple bullpen guys pushed this particular pitcher into the locker and said “Listen if you want to be a dick be a dick but do it quietly.” And you know for a young kid to do that good for him. Good for him. And...it’s hard for a pitcher who only performs every fifth or sixth day to take a leadership role but Marco has really kind of owned that.

Kyle Lewis for being a rookie will be a leader in our clubhouse. And I have to compliment Kyle Seager [he] is a veteran player. He’s probably overpaid but his attitude and this has been a tough couple of years where we traded veterans and came in with young kids who are learning and Kyle Seager has stayed positive and has had a tremendous attitude. There’s been several times that’s why I whispered in his ear that he’s going to be a Mariner Hall of Famer because it’s gotta be some tough years for him but he’s been positive he’s been upbeat and it’s really been fun to watch him grow.

Q: Tell us about Julio Rodríguez.

KM: Julio Rodríguez has got a personality bigger than all of you combined. He is loud his English is not tremendous. But he and Kelenic are very good friends. He’s a year behind Kelenic he probably...won’t be here till 2022 or 2023. Fantastic kid. We’re really big on social media he loves to get out in front he loves the Mariners and between him and Kelenic we think we’ve got an outfield that will be as good as any in baseball for the next six years. He’s the real deal. He’s ranked higher than Kelenic which..as I said Kelenic doesn’t lack for confidence. Kelenic is not happy that he’s the fifth highest prospect on Baseball America and Rodríguez is the fourth highest prospect. It’s little things like that bother Kelenic.

Q: It’s pretty clear that you’re pretty frustrated with the union. What other things what other issues are out there that are keeping you awake at night?

KM: I worry about our fans. I worry about you know...We need to make it easy for fans to come to T-Mobile Park and I’ve really challenged my operations department my concessions my merchandise: If they’re coming to T-Mobile Park they shouldn’t have to stand in line to spend money with us they shouldn’t have to stand in line to get into the building. We need to get better with big crowds. Part of it is [that] the rules have changed since 9/11 you know magnetometers and we’re...gonna bury big bollards out in the sidewalk so that the truck can’t drive into the stadium. The rules have changed and we have to pay attention. We have to make it easy for fans to come to the ballpark.

I worry about the neighborhood. You know we have employees that show up at 4:15 and leave at 10 o’clock at night and there’s not enough parking so I can get away with charging $30 $40 $50 to park in my tiny little parking garage across the street so I don’t let my employees park there. I have them park down on the other side of...CenturyLink I’ll call it CenturyLink. And so I hire police to escort them to their cars as they check out and punch out and they walk in groups in their escort with police. We got to do something about our neighborhood. I worry about once this is behind us getting people to come to T-Mobile Park is. It’s going to be critical. My parking guy is talking about socially distanced fans the 9000 I talked about and he wants to have all these management people back to run the parking garage. I said there’s going to be for 9000 people there’s enough parking around the ballpark you’re going to open the gates and say park for free for crying out loud! Stop it. But little things like that that we have to do to entice fans to come back down and experience the fun and joy of gathering and T-Mobile.

Q: What’s happened to the season ticket holders?

KM: It’s remarkable how many season ticket holders left their money with us. I had to point out to the bank. In the next year here’s our forecast for next year we’re required to give them the budget. I said I’m not expecting the season ticket holders to pay me in advance...There’s going to be a little bit of a [inaudible]. As we start the season we will likely offer them seats socially distanced seats and they will use up their credit. My suspicion is they won’t be able to use their entire credit because of socially distanced requirements but our season ticket fan base it’s remarkable. We gave them a 15% discount in 2021 if they left their money with us and a shockingly high percentage [did]. And we’re very appreciative.

Q: Kevin the changes in the minor league organizations around baseball and the fewer teams. What does that mean for the Mariners and also the new status of the Everett franchise and their relationship with the parent club?

KM: Minor league baseball went through a dramatic change. We went from some teams [having] six or seven minor league teams. We went to four per club. It was you know we tried to negotiate it with minor league baseball. We we owned 51% you didn’t ask this but we owned 51% of the Modesto Nuts. The reason we own 51% of the Modesto Nuts is [that] we were sick and tired of playing in lousy facilities. So we bought 51% so we could then move our minor league affiliate there. It was things like that that drove the change in minor league baseball. We had the choice they called us and asked if we wanted to stay in Everett. Everett was a short season [club] they started in the middle of June and ended in September. The short season teams are now gone. They asked us if we wanted to stay in Everett we quite frankly like the owner in Everett. We thought he was a good person we like the location of Everett we don’t particularly like the facility called Everett. We talked to the owner we could’ve gone to Spokane we could’ve gone to Vancouver B.C. but the problem with Vancouver is that you run into visa problems particularly when you bring kids from Venezuela and the Domincan and try to get them across the border for a three-game season.

And I’m about to watch your facial expressions because not only is the replay here to stay we’ll have an electronic strike zone within two years. The umpire behind home plate will be called by a machine. There’ll be a home plate umpire he’ll have a piece in his ear so just in case the ball bounces through the strike zone and the machine calls that a strike he can overrule that. The electronic strike zone is coming it’s pretty hard to argue that the technology doesn’t exist to do that. They’re within millimeters now of uh every pitch heck they know the spin rate on every pitch that’s thrown. And everybody’s analyzing the data on all of that. So it’s there it exists and they’re going to use it. We just have to get better at the replays when we have a replay it’s gotta be done quickly and move on. There can’t be a two minute stop of the action.

Q: Baseball today has a lot of players from other countries obviously from the Caribbean and Venezuela but now from Korea and Japan etc. What does the club do to help these players learn English?

KM: Some clubs are better than others. 20 years ago if we signed a 16 year old in the Dominican we’d send them to a dumpy old academy with no hot water and a lousy rock-filled field. Then when he was 18 or 19 we’d send him to Peoria Arizona put him up at the Hampton Inn and give him $30 a day. He doesn’t even know how to make change! $30 a day for per diem and surprise surprise they’d get in trouble because they wouldn’t know how to speak the language or make change or even buy dinner.

That’s all changed. We have an academy in the Dominican now our Venezuelan and Dominican kids are there for several years. English is taught English classes are mandatory high school diplomas are mandatory. And life skills here’s a dollar bill here’s a quarter here’s how it works. Really critically important as much as their skills as a pitcher or hitter or shortstop critically important skills so they can survive and thrive in the United States which is what we’re ultimately hoping they do! Some teams [are] better than others I’d like to think we’re on the front edge of that we’ve got a really nice academy.

As far as Korea Japan Taiwan those players are typically older. THey don’t come over as 16 or 18 year olds they come over as 28 30 32 year olds. We typically...it frustrates me...For instance we just re-hired Iwakuma he was a pitcher with us for a number of years. Wonderful human being his English was terrible. He wanted to get back into the game he came to us we quite frankly want him as our Asian scout interpreter what’s going on with the Japanese league. He’s coming to spring training. And I’m going to say I’m tired of paying his interpreter. When he was a player we’d pay Iwakuma X but we’d also have to pay $75000 a year to have an interpreter with him. His English suddenly got better his English got better when we told him that! For the older players from the Far East we have an interpreter that travels with them. For the younger Dominicans Venezuelans Caribbean players we really invest in them at a young age before they get here. Good question! It’s important.

Q: A couple questions one relating to pitchers one relating to the draft. You went to the six-man rotation last year that seemed more logical due to the season. Do you see this as something that’s part of the future? And along those lines what do you see with these relievers starting games like Tampa does? And the second question there last year’s draft was five rounds instead of the 40 rounds...it’s been in the past. What do you see happening with that going forward?

KM: One of the reasons we reduced the number of minor league teams is that we’d have a 40 round draft simply to staff a roster. The days of finding a fireballer from you know Bumbleduck North Dakota in the 39th round and he turns out to be Cy Young those days are over. There’s too much video...scouting now a lot of it is done on video and the players send stuff in and as we get closer to the draft for the high-end players we’ll go see them. As a general rule a lot of the scouting is done electronically via videos. That’s one reason we reduced the number of teams because why are we spending all this money when...and I apologize I don’t know the stats but I did at one point: After the 5th round the chances of making the major leagues over the last 8 years are…[Video cuts off].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC9ibGFjay1hbmQtbW9iaWxlLXRha2VvdXQtZGVsaXZlcnktYmxhY2stb3duZWQtcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtYnJhaW5zdG9ybS1yZWludmVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the first Black-owned food delivery business serving exclusively Black-owned restaurants,"While the radioactive dust of the 2016 election settled David Cabello 25 and his twin brother Aaron faced a crossroads: continue with their degrees at Shippensburg University or drop out to pursue a personal mandate: “We wanted to help Black people and Black businesses” David says. “It was our focus our only thing. We didn’t know how we were going to do it of course. We were 21 years old and broke. We just knew we wanted to help.”

Aaron had an additional decision: de-enlisting from the National Guard. He didn’t think his drill sergeant would take it well when he filed his paperwork an essay expressing his concern about a future where martial law and fighting innocent civilians was not only possible but likely (see: St. John’s photo op). But he didn’t think the white man from his hometown would tell him “This Black Lives Matter shit is fucking stupid. You’re worthless and you’re never going to be anything just like the rest of them.”

Aaron left the military and the brothers dropped out of school and moved back home to Philly. They started working at Black and Nobel a bookstore where the twins sought a path to enlightenment and empowerment from the older Black men who ran the place. “But we were still broke” David says. So when a coworker told David about his lucrative side gig delivering by bike for Postmates he jumped at a job that played to his athleticism and hardscrabble work ethic. On a bike he figured nobody would outdeliver him.

Aaron went along with it because twins and soon the Cabellos were delivering for Postmates andUberEats. But David had his sights on Caviar which serviced the highest-caliber restaurants. Delivering bronze-extruded pastas and bijou bottled cocktails paid more than Styrofoam coffins of tacos and wings and the delivery crowd knew it. “It was taking six seven months even longer for people to get hired by Caviar” David says. “So instead of waiting I just went right to the corporate office and showed them I was eager and ready to work and they just gave me the job.” Aaron didn’t get hired so the twins Parent Trap–ed the delivery service. “We just used the same account. I would do a five-hour shift take a break charge my electric bike and then Aaron would go out there for five hours. We were doing 10 11-hour days. I’m sure they probably thought ‘How is he delivering for that long?’”

During one marathon session they pulled in $1100 in 30 hours. David recalls “I was like if I can make this much money delivering food on a bicycle how much can I make if I owned a company?” He searched “How do I start a delivery service” on YouTube built an app on Shopify and plastered over the Caviar logo on his delivery bag with a new one: Black and Mobile touted by its cofounders to be the only Black-owned delivery service exclusively servicing Black-owned restaurants.

COVID’s acceleration of delivery dependence plus a surge in support for Black-owned businesses in the wake of George Floyd’s death put Black and Mobile on a fast track to expansion in 2020 one in which tech was essential. Courtesy of Black and Mobile

Black and Mobile which David and Aaron officially started in 2019 solves for the service gaps in Black communities on both the consumer and supplier ends. Delivery platforms may deprioritize or outright redline majority-minority neighborhoods as was the case in D.C. and the high fees and tech barriers can make a third-party partnership untenable for Black-owned restaurants if they’re courted at all.

“You would think big national businesses would have good customer service and not have such high sign-up costs and commission fees” says Shon Emanuel third-generation owner of Supreme Oasis a Black and Mobile partner famous for its vegan oxtail and strawberry cake in West Philly. “Black and Mobile has less and takes less”; 20% to be exact or 15% for partner restaurants that deliver exclusively through the service. The industry standard can be as high as 30% in cities without commission caps.

Since partnering with Black and Mobile Emanuel has seen business go up 35% to 40%. “Once we got on their platform people were telling us ‘We didn’t know you were Black-owned; we didn’t even know you were opened.’ Customers from Black and Mobile in other cities are asking us to ship them our oxtails. People want to support Black businesses and with Black and Mobile you can support two for one.”

Both the upwelling of support for Black businesses during a summer of racial reckoning and a pandemic that has grossly enriched national delivery platforms have been good for Black and Mobile’s business. “It’s definitely unfortunate that our business picked up since a Black man got murdered” David says. “We started getting a lot of attention and sales during that time” and Black and Mobile expanded from Philly into Detroit Atlanta and Baltimore. The old Shopify app David designed couldn’t keep up.

“Tech is the only thing that matters honestly” David says. “If the tech is right for drivers to operate the system for the customer to order; if it’s right and looks good and works properly every time that’s what matters.” He hired a young local development company to design a new app but according to David the company wound up blowing the deadline for Black and Mobile’s Atlanta launch in July: “Ten hours before the launch literally at midnight they let me know they needed more time.” More so than the botched launch David says the new app didn’t work. “Drivers only work if there are orders. People couldn’t place them and restaurants weren’t getting them. Our reputation was severely impacted. Our ratings on Google went from a 4.7 to a three.”

David puts the loss at around $300000: “We were close to going out of business. My mom had to loan me a couple thousand dollars.”

Enter Pepsi. (Yes Pepsi.) In June PepsiCo Global Foodservice made a $400 million commitment to fight the combined impact of COVID-19 and racial inequality. One of the programs under that umbrella is Dig In: “What we call a purposeful rallying cry to double down on our support for Black-owned businesses with a particular focus on restaurants” says Scott Finlow global chief marketing officer of PepsiCo Foodservice. “It’s a program that’s holistic sustained—versus transactional—and focused on ensuring owners are equipped with technology and tools to make it through the pandemic and thrive.” It’s a program with a $50 million budget and partnership over five years not the corporate version of posting a black square on Instagram then going back to brunch.

When it comes to tech says Finlow “there’s a capabilities gap [between white- and Black-owned businesses] which comes from access to and cost of capital. The structural disadvantage that goes back generations has led to Black restaurants being undercapitalized and not necessarily having some of the tools that let them invest in the tech that’s increasingly required to work in an off-premises world—which is a make-or-break capability today.”

As one of PepsiCo’s Dig In partners Black and Mobile is funding the rehabilitation of its app with the help of a Black-owned tech team 180Atlas out of Florida. “It was the support we needed to keep going” David says. “Fixing the tech side of it is our main focus. I think that’s all we’re missing at this point.”

Even in the midst of a huge setback last year Black and Mobile’s 2020 revenues were $500000 a 2000% increase from the previous year. David paid his mom back and has Houston and Los Angeles in his sights. “Our goal for this year” he says. “A million.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvZmViLzIwL2NvbnZpY3RlZC1raWxsZXItYXJyZXN0ZWQtb24tZHJ1Zy1jaGFyZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Convicted killer arrested on drug charges | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"BENTONVILLE -- A man convicted in the murder of two children was arrested Wednesday in connection with drug charges after deputies found methamphetamine with a child nearby according to a probable cause affidavit filed Friday.

Ricky Crisp 45 of Garfield was released Friday on $50000 bond from the Benton County Jail. He was arrested in connection with methamphetamine manufacture possession of meth or cocaine with the purpose to deliver and exposing a child to chemical substance or meth.

The investigation began Wednesday after deputies responded to a death investigation at 19415 U.S. 62 in Garfield according to the affidavit.

A woman was dead in a camper trailer on the property according to the affidavit. Benton County Coroner Daniel Oxford identified the woman as Tina Crisp 45. Oxford said the death is under investigation and he's awaiting toxicology results.

Gary Crisp who owns the trailer told deputies his son's wife and her son live in the trailer according to the affidavit.

Ricky Crisp was at the scene and at first denied living in the trailer the affidavit states. He later told deputies he also lived in the trailer and said he lied because he wasn't authorized to live at the location by his probation officer according to the affidavit.

He said a pipe that tested positive for meth was his and he had been using it daily to smoke meth according to the affidavit.

Crisp said his son who has Down syndrome and isn't mobile or verbal was sitting on the couch near a one-pot meth lab while his mother was dying according to the affidavit.

Deputies found two plastic bottles used to make meth and found meth in a wood box in the trailer according to the affidavit.

Crisp was convicted in 1998 of two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of his 16-month-old daughter Vicky Crisp and her 4-month-old cousin Sidney Pippen according to records from Benton County Circuit Court.

The two girls died April 25 1998 from heat exhaustion and dehydration after they were left in an unventilated car for several hours according to reports. The car was parked along a dirt road northeast of Bentonville while Crisp and Justin Griffith searched a nearby cave and the surrounding area for mushrooms.

Crisp was sentenced to 14 years in prison March 25 1999 and was released on parole in December 2002.

Griffith pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection with the girls' deaths and was placed on 10 years of probation. He was later sentenced to six years in prison for violating the terms of his probation. Griffith was released on parole in 2002.

Crisp's arraignment is scheduled for March 29 in Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green's courtroom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3NhbXN1bmctcy1wZW4tYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmVzLTEyMDE0MTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is there no real competition to Samsung's S Pen?,"Eric Zeman / Android Authority

When you think about stylus-equipped phones Samsung’s Galaxy Note series and the S Pen are likely the first things that come to mind. And there’s no doubt that the Note is reasonably popular. The Note 2o Ultra was one of the top five strongest-selling phones in the US and South Korea as of October 2020 according to Counterpoint Research.

But there’s a problem: try thinking of a modern pen-friendly phone that isn’t made by Samsung. While there are certainly a few such as the Moto G Stylus and (if you buy a pen separately) the HUAWEI Mate series Samsung and the S Pen tower above all of these in both sales and name recognition. There’s no meaningful competition. Even our list of Galaxy Note 20 alternatives is focused on big-screen flagships that have no stylus option.

Why is that though? Samsung’s technological advantages with the S Pen certainly help but the very nature of the smartphone market is a factor as well. Simply put Samsung reigns supreme over a small patch of land and that’s unlikely to change any time soon.

There isn’t much of a market for stylus phones

Oliver Cragg / Android Authority

You may love Samsung’s S Pen dearly but it’s a bitter truth that there isn’t much of an audience for stylus-equipped phones. In that Counterpoint study the top-selling handsets were all pen-free models. Even Samsung’s bestsellers were either budget models or conventional flagships such as the Galaxy A51 and S20 Plus. And remember not everyone who buys a Galaxy Note uses the pen — some may simply buy it to have the most powerful phone Samsung makes at the time it’s released.

That’s not surprising. Many people need smartphones but only a fraction of those people want to scribble notes or draw impromptu sketches. Styluses like Samsung’s S Pen are luxuries even among high-end phone buyers and that could easily remain true in an era where handwriting is less common than ever. See also: The best Android phones

That in turn affects rivals’ willingness to enter (or re-enter) the category. They’d be releasing phones that even in the most wildly optimistic scenarios would only sell to a small portion of the market. That’s a tough ask for any company let alone LG and other struggling brands that may bleed cash at the slightest hint of trouble.

Even the market leader seems to be cautious. Samsung’s decision to add S Pen support to the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a tacit acknowledgment that styluses are nice-to-have features rather than necessities. While it might not represent the death knell for the Galaxy Note line (not as we write this at least) it certainly suggests that Samsung isn’t counting on an included S Pen as a sales driver.

Samsung’s S Pen is simply more powerful

Oliver Cragg / Android Authority

We’d be remiss if we didn’t point out the obvious: Samsung’s S Pen is the most robust mobile stylus on the market.

Yes you can use the pens for devices like the Moto G Stylus to quickly jot down notes or annotate a screenshot but those competitors usually stop where Samsung begins. You can use the S Pen to peek at information translate languages and (with the right model) remote control a presentation. Samsung’s gadget can be helpful even if you have no interest in drawing or note-taking. Read more: Samsung S Pen — the ultimate guide

That’s an important consideration if you’re cross-shopping phones of course but it also has major implications for the competition. Samsung has roughly a decade of experience refining the Galaxy Note. Any would-be challenger is likely to have much less know-how and might even start from scratch. Why release a phone that competes directly with the Note when Samsung could be miles ahead?

This isn’t to say that other companies are guaranteed to flounder with their pen-packing phones but it’s telling that the choices are typically lower-end products like the LG Q Stylus Plus. They’re effectively dancing around Samsung and the S Pen scooping up customers who can’t justify the Galaxy Note’s premium prices and are willing to sacrifice a few features.

Much of the competition has already backed off

David Imel / Android Authority

Other phone makers have tried to knock the S Pen off its throne before. Samsung already won the war for high-end stylus supremacy and its competitors don’t appear willing to start a new fight.

LG is the quintessential example. It countered the Galaxy Note with the Optimus Vu. While this was a powerful phone for the time its odd aspect ratio latecomer status and other quirks kept it from garnering the same buzz as the Note. LG tried multiple versions of the Optimus Vu to no avail — you can’t blame it for shying away from direct competition after Samsung delivered such a bruising with the S Pen.

Would you be more likely to buy a phone if it came with a stylus? 1821 votes Yes 83 % No 17 %

Even phones with optional pens haven’t fared so well. Sony’s Xperia Z Ultra could use seemingly anything as a stylus but that didn’t move the needle. HUAWEI hasn’t exactly had runaway success with its M-Pen either. And no Apple’s Pencil doesn’t really count. While the iPad is a better device because of its stylus support it’s strictly an optional add-on and isn’t available for the iPhone.

Any viable contender would have to roughly match or beat the S Pen on capability while learning from past mistakes.

Could some company eventually offer stiff competition to Samsung’s S Pen? Quite possibly. But any viable contender would have to roughly match or beat the S Pen on capability while learning from past mistakes. That’s a tall order for any company and there’s no one on the horizon that seems able (or willing) to take on that daunting task.

The developer platform responded to a DMCA takedown request from Take-Two Interactive which also listed dozens of forks. While reverse engineering can in some cases be classified as fair use it's certainly not always the case.

Last week a group of passionate fans released a project that had many hardcore GTA fans excited. After years of work they published “Re3” and “reVC” two fully reverse-engineered releases of the GTA 3 and Vice City code.

The reverse-engineered code opens the door to many tweaks and modifications that make the old games much more playable on modern computers. That said it still requires an official copy to work properly because the game assets are not included.

The release got a lot of attention in the media when it came out including an excellent report from Eurogamer. While the project leader “aap” was happy with the positive reactions it meant that Take-Two and its parent company Rockstar Games would notice as well.

For months the team avoided getting an angry letter from the game publishers. They hoped that the companies would not go after the projects when they were posted on GitHub either. However that was idle hope.

On Friday GitHub posted a DMCA takedown notice where Take-Two and Rockstar Games request the removal of the “Re3” and “reVC” repositories as well as several forks.

“The content in the links below consists of copyrighted materials owned by Take-Two. The use of our copyrighted content in these links are unauthorized and it should be removed immediately” the notice reads.

Project leader “aap” isn’t entirely convinced that this notice actually comes from the game company. For now however he’s working on the assumption that it’s real.

GitHub also took the matter seriously and immediately removed the repositories. The platform further notes that it “processed the takedown notice against the entire fork network.”

In theory “aap” and his team can file a DMCA counter-notice. This means that GitHub will have to restore the code after two weeks unless Take-Two files a lawsuit.

A legal battle isn’t cheap so “aap” and his team will try to figure out the nature of the takedown claims first. Under US law reverse-engineering can be seen as fair use but this area is a bit of a minefield.

For example people can circumvent DRM restrictions in order to reverse engineer a game for research or educational use. However publishing the code online is something different.

The EFF has a detailed write-up on reverse engineering that lays out the various challenges showing how complicated the matter can be.

In its DMCA notice Take-Two notes that it has taken fair use into consideration. So if the project creators decide to challenge the removal this matter could eventually end up in court.

Fair use or not one might wonder how much damage these two projects were actually causing. They’re not commercial and shouldn’t impact sales significantly since both games are nearly two decades old. If anything they promote the GTA enterprise.

Take-Two and Rockstar Games obviously disagree. Perhaps they are concerned that some will exploit the code in some shape or form. However the DMCA notice isn’t going to solve that as copies of “Re3” and “reVC” are still available to those who know where to look…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tMy12aWNlLWNpdHktZmFuLXByb2plY3RzLWhpdC1jb3B5cmlnaHQtdGFrZWRvd25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City Fan Projects Hit by Copyright Takedowns,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2dyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8tMy12aWNlLWNpdHktZmFuLXByb2plY3RzLWhpdC1jb3B5cmlnaHQtdGFrZWRvd25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd29sb2xvLm5ldC8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL3JlMy1yZXZlcnNlLWVuZ2luZWVyZWQtb3Blbi1zb3VyY2UtY29kZS1vZi1ndGFpaWktdmljZS1jaXR5LXRha2VuLWRvd24td2l0aC1kbWNhLW5vdGljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,re3 (reverse engineered open source code of GTAIII / Vice City) taken down with DMCA notice,"For all of us PS vita enthusiasts the past few months have seen a countless stream of releases related to GTA thanks in particular to developers The Flow Rinnegatamante and aap. The three developers have recently released Vita ports of several popular GTA games such as Vice City a few days ago. Those ports were based on the recently released “re3” source code a fully reverse engineered version of the official binaries.

Unfortunately the legal aspects of re3 where cloudy to say the least. The people originally behind this work stated themselves on the github repository: “We don’t feel like we’re in a position to give this code a license.”.

Take Two Interactive seemed to see it this way as well and sent a DMCA to github in order to take down the repository as well as all its forks. As of a few hours ago the github repositories related to the project all lead to an error message pointing to the dmca request. As for the request itself it is unequivocal:

The content in the links below consists of copyrighted materials owned by Take-Two. The use of our copyrighted content in these links are unauthorized and it should be removed immediately.

I personally doubt anybody will question that move even if it totally sucks. With that being said it is possible a cleaner version of the reverse engineered work could surface as the repository allegedly contained binary fonts and “story” files. Arguably reverse engineered code alone without any art/design would be legally harder to take down. But maybe the folks behind re3 don’t have the legal resources to fight that battle anyway.

As for the impact for the Vita community: the ports are already out and available and I’m convinced it will always be possible to find them somewhere even if a decision is made to take them down from e.g. vitadb (at the time of this writing the games are still available on vitadb. Get them while you can?). But whether they ever get updated modded or improved moving forward is a big question mark.

Once again Take Two Interactive are completely in their right to ask for that take down legally but from an ethical perspective it sucks that a console that was never given any love by the publisher could now be impacted by such a decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ3RhLTMtc291cmNlLWNvZGUtcmV2ZXJzZS1lbmdpbmVlci1zaHV0LWRvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reverse-Engineered GTA 3 Source Code Shut Down By Rockstar,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZ3RhLTMtc291cmNlLWNvZGUtcmV2ZXJzZS1lbmdpbmVlci1zaHV0LWRvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Carbon markets enable the trading of carbon credits also referred to as carbon offsets.

One carbon credit is equivalent to one metric ton of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Going further carbon markets help companies compensate for their emissions and work towards their climate goals. But how exactly do carbon markets work?

In this infographic sponsored by Carbon Streaming Corporation we look at the fundamentals of carbon markets and why they show significant growth potential.

What Are Carbon Markets?

Carbon markets play an important role for many companies that want or are required to compensate for their carbon footprint along with meeting climate targets.

Companies buy carbon credits which fund a GHG reduction or removal project such as reforestation. This allows the company to compensate for their GHG emissions. There are two main types of carbon markets based on whether emission reductions are mandatory or voluntary:

Compliance Markets:

Mandatory systems regulated by government organizations to cap emissions for specific industries.

Voluntary Carbon Markets:

Where carbon credits can be purchased by those that voluntarily want to compensate for their emissions.

As demand to cut emissions intensifies voluntary carbon market volume has grown five-fold in three years.

Drivers of Carbon Market Demand

What factors are behind this surge in volume?

Paris Agreement: Companies seeking alignment with these goals.

Companies seeking alignment with these goals. Technological Gaps: Companies are limited by technologies that are available at scale and not cost-prohibitive.

Companies are limited by technologies that are available at scale and not cost-prohibitive. Time Gaps: Companies do not have the means to eliminate all emissions today.

Companies do not have the means to eliminate all emissions today. Stakeholder Pressure: Companies are facing pressure from stakeholders to address their emissions.

For these reasons carbon markets are a useful tool to compensate for emissions today and help decarbonize the global economy.

Voluntary Markets 101

To start there are four key participants in voluntary carbon markets:

Project Developers: Teams who design and implement carbon offset projects that generate carbon credits.

Teams who design and implement carbon offset projects that generate carbon credits. Standards Bodies: Organizations that certify and set the criteria for carbon credits e.g. Verra and the Gold Standard.

Organizations that certify and set the criteria for carbon credits e.g. Verra and the Gold Standard. Brokers: Intermediaries facilitating carbon credit transactions between buyers and project developers.

Intermediaries facilitating carbon credit transactions between buyers and project developers. End Buyers: Entities such as individuals or corporations looking to offset their carbon emissions through purchasing carbon credits.

Secondly carbon offset projects fall within one of two main categories.

Avoidance / reduction projects prevent or reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. These may include avoided deforestation or projects that provide fuel-efficient cookstoves.

Removal / sequestration projects on the other hand remove carbon from the atmosphere where projects may focus on reforestation or biochar production.

In addition carbon offset projects may offer co-benefits which provide advantages that go beyond carbon reduction or removal.

What Are Co-Benefits?

When a carbon project offers co-benefits it means that they provide features on top of carbon credits such as social environmental or economic characteristics that may align with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Here are some examples of co-benefits a project may offer:

Biodiversity: Protecting local wildlife that would otherwise be endangered through deforestation.

Protecting local wildlife that would otherwise be endangered through deforestation. Social: Promoting gender equality through the education of girls and women and supporting women in local business development.

Promoting gender equality through the education of girls and women and supporting women in local business development. Economic: Creating job opportunities in local communities.

Creating job opportunities in local communities. Educational: Providing educational awareness of carbon mitigation within local areas such as primary and secondary schools.

Often companies are looking to buy carbon credits that make the greatest sustainable impact. Co-benefits can offer additional value that simultaneously address broader climate challenges.

Why Market Values Are Increasing

In 2021 market values in voluntary carbon markets were nearly $2 billion.

Year Traded Volume of Carbon Offsets

(MtCO₂e) Voluntary Market

Transaction Value 2017 46 $146M 2018 98 $296M 2019 104 $320M 2020 203 $520M 2021 493 $1985M



Source: Ecosystem Marketplace (Aug 2022) Ecosystem Marketplace (Aug 2021)

Today oil majors banks and airlines are active players in the market. As corporate climate targets multiply future demand for carbon credits is projected to jump as much as four-fold by 2030 according to McKinsey.

What Qualifies as a High-Quality Carbon Offset?

Here are five key criteria for examining the quality of a carbon offset:

Additionality: Projects are unable to exist without revenue derived from carbon credits.

Projects are unable to exist without revenue derived from carbon credits. Verification: Monitored reported and verified by a credible third-party.

Monitored reported and verified by a credible third-party. Permanence: Carbon reduction or removal will not be reversed.

Carbon reduction or removal will not be reversed. Measurability: Calculated according to scientific data through a recognized methodology.

Calculated according to scientific data through a recognized methodology. Avoid Leakage: An increase in emissions should not occur elsewhere or account for any that do occur.

In fact the road to net-zero requires a 23 gigatonne (GT) annual reduction in CO₂ emissions relative to current levels. High quality carbon credits can help fund projects to meet this goal.

Fighting Climate Change

As the urgency to tackle global emissions accelerates demand for carbon credits is poised to increase substantially—bringing much needed capital to innovative projects.

Not only do carbon credits fund nature-based projects they also finance technological advancements and new innovations in carbon removal and reduction. For companies looking to reach their climate ambitions carbon markets will continue to play a more concrete role.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZGVtZXJhcmF3YXZlcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMC91czIwMC1taWxsaW9uLWZpYnJlLW9wdGljLWNhYmxlLXRvLXRhcmdldC1vaWwtaW5kdXN0cnktdW5zZXJ2ZWQtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US$200 million fibre optic cable to target oil industry unserved communities,"Last Updated on Saturday 20 February 2021 9:56 by Denis Chabrol

A new telecommunications company Canje Tel plans to invest US$200 million in a subsea fibre-optic cable to mainly serve the offshore oil and gas operations and remote communities with little or no access to the Internet a top official said Saturday.

Senior Engineer at Canje Tel Raymond Michael Kirton said an application and all supporting documents have been filed with government’s Telecommunications Agency with the hope of securing the licence. He said the Trinidad-based HARCON Group has already secured a US$200 million loan which is on standby to implement the project.

He said the roll-out time-line including maritime mapping would take three years around 2024 “when Guyana would be booming.”

The official explained that the cable would be 16 terabytes with a lifespan of 25 years. “We are looking to capitalise with a brand new cable” he said. Redundancy plans include creating a hub and an earth station he said.

Mr. Kirton said Canje Tel first applied in November 2020 and a few days ago submitted the final documents including proof of application to the Maritime Administration to conduct maritime surveys Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Sea Defence Board.

The company plans to serve the Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSOs) offshore directly in the Atlantic rather than come to shore first and then be rerouted back to the vessels. Mr. Kirton said the cable would land onshore at Now-or-Never Mahaicony with east and west linkages to cater for more oil and oil-related investments. A landing station data and contact centre would also be located there to create employment for the people and “bring some value to the community with the infrastructure.”

“We hope to land a sub-sea fibre optic cable to deliver enterprise level bandwidth to the huge companies like Exxon and all the other companies coming in to Guyana because there will be an increased need for bandwidth” he said.

If approval had been granted four years ago the Canje Tel official said his company would have been able to supply ExxonMobil with the required bandwidth. That American oil major has since decided to run its own fibre-optic cable to its FPSO.

Mr. Kirton said he was buoyed by recent pronouncements by Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo that another fibre-optic cable would be landing in Guyana.

The Canje Tel official said his companies planned to partner with small Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in those communities to supply bandwidth at a “reasonable rate” instead of sourcing from other providers like the Guyana Telephone and Telegraph (GTT).

If Guyana eventually offers 5G service Mr. Kirton said Canje Tel would possibly enter the local phone and mobile data market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3N0YXJ0LXVwcy9haG1lZGFiYWRiYXNlZC1zdGFydHVwLW1hdHRlci1iZXRzLW9uLWV2LW1hcmtldC1leWVzLTEtYm4tdHVybm92ZXItYnktMjAyNS0xMTYxMzg4NjIwNDg4My5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvc3RhcnQtdXBzL2FobWVkYWJhZGJhc2VkLXN0YXJ0dXAtbWF0dGVyLWJldHMtb24tZXYtbWFya2V0LWV5ZXMtMS1ibi10dXJub3Zlci1ieS0yMDI1L2FtcC0xMTYxMzg4NjIwNDg4My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ahmedabad-based startup Matter bets on EV market eyes $1 bn turnover by 2025 | Mint,"Bullish on the growth of electric vehicles (EV) market in India EV and energy storage technology startup Matter expects to clock a turnover of $1 billion (over ₹7250 crore) by 2025 according to a top company official.

The Ahmedabad-based company which has so far invested $3 million (over ₹20 crore) will be launching its lithium ion batteries for solar and renewable management by April which will be followed by its first electric motorcycle closer to Diwali this year.

""2021 is the year of the electric according to Matter... The industry as a whole would be much larger in five years time than even the best of estimates.

""We are expecting the same thing that happened with 4G the rate of adoption of 4G exploded above everyone's expectations and that is what we are expecting with EVs as well"" Matter Founder and CEO Mohal Lalbhai told PTI.

Explaining the rationale he said with India wanting to become a $5 trillion economy and its commitment to the Paris Climate Change Agreement the country has no option but to switch to EVs eco-friendly newer energies and energy solutions.

On why the sector has not been able to grow in the past Lalbhai said ""Electric (vehicles) fundamentally in India have either been overpriced products or under delivering products. There has never been a true value for money fit.""

Stating that customers understand internal combustion engine vehicle and its value proposition he further said ""But in electrics there are some companies who are 100% more expensive than the comparable internal combustion some who are 20% cheaper but they don't really deliver"".

He said inferior quality Chinese product kits are brought in and assembled in India and then and sold at much cheaper prices.

However he noted that's changing with new players coming in and focusing on developing their own products in India investing on R&D and attempting to offer the right value proposition in EVs.

Matter has been focussing on developing an electric motor that would have the performance similar to the internal combustion vehicles he added.

When asked about the company's own ambitions Lalbhai said ""By 2022-2023 we would like to do close to 50000 vehicles and including battery and vehicle we would like to do about $100 million (about ₹700 crore) in terms of topline and by 2025-26 (target) is a billion dollars combined revenue from vehicles and batteries.""

In order to achieve this target Matter has lined up its product launch and market expansion plans in place he said.

""We are branching out into two separate business lines. One is batteries which we would be rolling out in April 2021 and then vehicles closer to Diwali 2021"" Lalbhai said adding EVs will be under the Matter brand and batteries under Matter Energy.

In the battery segment the company is focusing more on grid level solutions such as 400 kilowatt to a megawatt level lithium ion batteries for solar and renewable management in large scale projects on a pure B2B business basis.

""And EVs as a product the motorcycle coming out in November that's going to be our B2C side of the business"" he said adding as far as EV products are concerned the company's primary focus is going to be high performance motorcycles.

Elaborating on the company's product plans for the short to medium term he said ""We would have two motorcycles in the market and from the battery side we are working on a few specialty applications and then there would be a lot of UPS inverter driven business also in that segment there.""

In the EV segment he said the first product will not have a detachable battery but the second product onwards the battery packs will be relatively smaller more or less the size of a tiffin which can be taken out for charging.

I didn’t know what the issue was and I was super busy and didn’t have time to deal with it so I took it to Tesla and they said the upper control arm in the front on pass side was bad and needed replaced. So they replaced it and $1000 later there was no more squeak.

A few months goes by and then all of a sudden I get the same noise again but this time coming from drivers side. Now I’m getting pissed off because a vehicle that costs north of 100K shouldn’t have issues like this just out of warranty. I’m a pretty handy guy so I decided to jump in and take a look at it. I jacked up the vehicle and took off the front tire. I put a second jack just under the lower control arm to take the pressure off the suspension and I removed the bolt that connects the upper control arm (see attached). It’s a 15mm nut with a torx on the opposite side. With the bolt out I used the jack to lower the suspension about 1” and then used a small pry bar to pop out the upper control arm from the socket. I noticed the ball joint was stiff. I clamped on a pair of vice grips onto the stud of the ball joint and proceeded to rotate the ball joint around and around and side to side and front to back to move all the grease around inside the socket of the ball joint. I moved it around for about 2 minutes until it didn’t feel as tight because of the lubrication. I then jacked up the suspension the 1” I had lowered it and then pulled down the upper control arm to drop the ball joint stud back down into the hole. I had to use a large pair of pliers to sort of clamp it together to get it to go in. I prob could have done it by hand but pliers made it easier. I reinstalled the bolt that I removed and put the tire back on. Voila no more squeak. The suspension is completely quiet.

The issue is the grease inside the ball joint doesn’t get moved around inside the socket enough and causes a squeaking over time. This took me all of 15 minutes start to finish to complete. That’s the easiest $1000 I ever saved.

If you are a mechanical person it’s a quick and easy fix.

Wish I had of done this when my first one was noisy and would have saved a thousand bucks. Lesson learned.

See attached picture of the only bolt that needs to be removed. Except the wheel nuts of course.

I hope this info is able to help someone else.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjIvdGVzbGEtaGFzLW1hZGUtMS1iaWxsaW9uLXByb2ZpdC1vbi1pdHMtYml0Y29pbi1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWFuYWx5c3QuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAyLzIyL3Rlc2xhLWhhcy1tYWRlLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1wcm9maXQtb24taXRzLWJpdGNvaW4taW52ZXN0bWVudC1hbmFseXN0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla has made about $1 billion in profit on its bitcoin investment analyst estimates,"In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Tesla has made roughly $1 billion in paper profits from its investment into bitcoin  according to Daniel Ives analyst at Wedbush Securities. The company is ""on a trajectory to make more from its Bitcoin investments than profits from selling its EV (electric vehicle) cars in all of 2020"" Ives estimated in a note published Saturday.

Last year's big zero-one saw the first 51 of our faded automotive stars loaded in to an Excel spreadsheet to produce the perfect synthesis - which turned out to be a Maserati Quattroporte. This year I've been allowed to take a less strenuous celebratory approach one that looks forwards rather than back.

Yes it's a Tesla a decision that has seen a substantial amount of server power put on standby for the flame wars likely to break out in the comments. This Model S is both our first electric Pill and a statistical ding to the eight-plus average cylinder count that has been maintained since the column's debut CLK 55 AMG. On those grounds alone many will see it as a betrayal of the mechanical risk and head-in-hands MPG numbers that Pill was established to celebrate. Yet it's also a gentle acknowledgement of the way the world is heading. Consider it Brave Pill of the future.

There are plenty of more courageous EVs out there than this 101000 mile Model S. I tried to find a G-Wiz - the deathtrap that was briefly popular with the most virtuous of virtue signalers in the early 'noughties and which still sits atop the list of the worst cars I have ever experienced. At least it would if it was actually a car; the G-Wiz was too slow and insubstantial to be legally regarded as such. It was a barely motorized quadricycle that combined the performance of a milk float with the design and impact protection of a hamster cage. Piloting one around the North Circular in a rainstorm was one of the most terrifying drives of my life. Probably fortunately there are none in the classifieds.

But even when bigger and more serious manufacturers started to make EVs evolution was gradual. The Mitsubishi iMIEV was a huge leap over rubbish like the G-Wiz. But it was tiny slow struggled to go more than 60 miles on a charge and rode like it was being ridden. The first Nissan Leaf was bigger rangier and more refined - but no more exciting. Electric cars were dull worthy and designed to engender smugness rather than desire.

Which is where Tesla spotted its opportunity. When the Roadster came out in 2008 it was obviously Lotus based and cost nearly £100000. It was short on luxury but big on thrills unarguably fast and properly exhilarating. This was an EV that was both willing and able to go sideways. Rivals were trying to create the electric version of the Volkswagen Beetle Tesla had gone straight to building an ion-fueled 911. The Fisker Karma was going to be a range extender rather than a pure EV which most pundits reckoned was a far safer technology choice back then.

Fisker got to market first and immediately proved Tesla's decision to stay fully electric right. Journos and potential buyers who were invited to drive the Karma soon discovered a dramatically split personality with silent progress under electric power but a food blender impression when the distinctly unposh GM four-cylinder fired into noisy life. When the production Model S emerged in 2012 it proved to be both simpler and better combining a potent and near silent powertrain with range that looked incredible compared to the modest numbers of earlier EVs - all bar the base version could go at least 200 miles.

Early sales were restricted to the U.S. where press reaction was some way short of fulsome certainly when delivered by automotive rather than tech journalists. The Model S's performance and refinement received plenty of praise but there was less love for the minimalist cabin and the need to use the huge central touchscreen for almost every function. Some shonky build quality didn't help warm up the reviews. The wider motor industry seemed to treat Tesla as a curious anomaly rather than a genuine competitor one that would soon get overwhelmed when the big boys turned their attentions to this insignificant niche.

Hindsight has knocked that one over the pavilion roof of course. The Model S was soon winning hearts minds and a growing number of customers. It was a huge hit with affluent tech savvy buyers Silicon Valley's parking lots were full of them but also among those looking for something completely different. UK sales began in 2014 with two 382hp rear-drivers - with either 60kWh or 85kWh batteries - and a brawnier P85 that combined the bigger pack with a brawnier 469hp motor. Prices started at £54900 with the government's then EV subsidy dropping that to £49900.

While the car was impressive Tesla's greatest early achievement was recognising the importance of the 'everything else' bit. The company started to roll out a network of dedicated high-speed Superchargers as soon as sales began one that was well beyond the apparent requirements for the modest number of cars out there. For a couple of years some of these looked like white elephants - long lines of empty chargers were a common sight - but use grew as sales increased. As the buyers of rival EVs discovered the inadequacies of third-party charging networks - a great way to start a conversation with an I-Pace or e-tron owner - so the perceived advantage has grown.

Bringing us back to our Pill the cheapest Tesla currently to be found in the classifieds although its £27990 price tag is proof of the impressive sturdy residuals that early examples enjoyed as slightly later adopters piled in. Ours has the combination of the 85kWh battery pack black paint and a cream interior that seems to have stood up well to what has evidently been a busy life. It is an early car with the original black nose cone - facelifted Ses got a small aperture - but Tesla's decision to eschew the fashion for regular cosmetic updates means it otherwise looks very similar to a brand-new example.

Of course Tesla's iterative updates to tech functions means that much of the driving experience will feel out of date when compared to a spiffy new example - a reality reflected in the substantial difference in price. The dealer selling our Pill hasn't given a breakdown of all the goodies present but the pictures confirm the presence of the radar sensor in the lower grille that proves it is carrying the hardware for the original Autopilot 1.0 system - active lane keeping combined with smart cruise - although this will need to have been software enabled to work.

The internet offers no shortage of stories about egregious Tesla quality issues with these inevitably followed by a spittle-flecked rebuttal from St. Elon's legions of online defenders. But our Pill's mileage has already proved its longevity and is backed by an MOT history consisting solely of unblemished passes. Yet while a powertrain with a single moving part will always lack peril when compared to an elderly V8 or V12 the long-term health of the battery pack is a more pressing question. Tesla warranties Model S packs for eight years or 150000 miles in the UK so our November 2014 registered Pill should still be covered against catastrophic borkage.

While the battery packs of leggier Teslas do degrade over time they usually to do this at a much slower rate than many pessimists predicted; even owners of cars with cars that have covered 200000 miles report packs retaining more than 80 per cent of their original capacity. Other issues include suspension componentry failures and the common failure of the central display screen solved through fitting a new memory chip. Perhaps the biggest financial risk issue for Teslas from this era will be the slipping balance of supply and demand as newer EVs start to enter the secondhand market in greater numbers. Values could well slide quickly.

So not the most courageous of Brave Pills for this milestone but a very futuristic one. Before you know it we'll all be reminiscing about the far-off days of 85kWh battery packs and chargers with plugs like nostalgic Fast Ford fanboys discussing Escort RS Turbos and cruises to Southend.

The change comes amid broader pricing and configurator changes that are becoming hard to follow.

Last month Tesla launched a new Model Y Standard Range RWD with 244 miles of range.

The launch was surprising considering CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla won’t produce the version of the Model Y because he said that the range would be “unacceptably low” at less than 250 miles.

Tesla released the version of the vehicle with an EPA estimated range of 244 miles and a starting price of $42000.

Last week the automaker surprised again by reducing the price of the new base version of the Model Y by $2000 just a month after launching it.

The price change was part of a broader pricing update throughout the Model 3 and Model Y lineup.

Now just a few days later Tesla confuses us all by no longer taking orders for the new Model Y Standard Range RWD and removing it altogether from its online configurator:

As usual Tesla didn’t communicate any reason behind this sudden change in the Model Y lineup.

The Model Y Standard Range has also disappeared from Tesla’s Canadian online configurator.

Along with the removal of the base version of the Model Y Tesla also reduced the price of the Model Y Long Range AWD by $1000 to $48990.

That version of the electric SUV which is now becoming the base version was the only one not to receive a price change in the update last week.

Electrek’s Take

These moves from Tesla are hard to follow.

It’s unclear if the Model Y Standard Range is now canceled altogether or if Tesla is pausing taking orders for the version of the electric SUV.

As we previously reported we thought it was a great move by Tesla to launch the vehicle and that despite Elon’s previous comment about the version of the Model Y we thought it would sell like hotcakes.

Now it’s gone. At least for now.

We have to keep in mind that all those price changes in the US are coming amid the increasing possibility that the federal government is going to bring back the tax credit for Tesla buyers which could greatly affect Tesla’s sales in the market until we have more clarity on the situation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzgxMTMvdGVzbGEtbWFraW5nLWl0LWhhcmQtb3RoZXItY2FyLWNvbXBhbmllcy1jb21wZXRl0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9ycXVlbmV3cy5jb20vODExMy90ZXNsYS1tYWtpbmctaXQtaGFyZC1vdGhlci1jYXItY29tcGFuaWVzLWNvbXBldGUvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Is Making It Hard For Other Car Companies To Compete,"Follow us today...

When Henry Ford made the assembly line happen automobile prices dropped like a rock into a pond. The ripple effect that it had after that set a precedence that as technology and advancements occur things should cost less.

Well that victory was short-lived. As competition grew more intense automotive makers had to pack their cars with better features to outsell each other. The issue with that is that it made cars more expensive even though the value to the consumer increased.

With many types of technology flat-screen TV's for example initially had incredibly high prices. I recently went through a Costco and found a 60"" HDTV for $395 (or something close to that). I bring this up because as technology advances we should be able to find ways to make things more affordable not more expensive.

A friend of mine recently bought a brand new 2020 Ford F-250 6.7L Diesel with the Roush package. The pickup has just about every option you can think of minus the massage seats (yes that is a thing). All this technology set him back a cool $120000 all said and done. I about choked when I heard that.

The pickup is excellent do not get me wrong on that but after driving it off the lot it now is valued at $80000 but he owes more than that on it. The whole idea is rather disgusting to me even if he can afford the $1400 a month payments.

My point here is that with new technology we should be finding ways to keep a stable price or decrease the cost of our transportation.

Tesla Motors: Working Hard To Make Awesome Cars Affordable For All

Tesla started off by charging exorbitant amounts of money for the first-generation roadster. The trend of high-cost cars did not stop there though. Early first-generation Model S owners spent a pretty penny too.

It was not until the Model 3 came out that Tesla cars started to look like anyone could afford them. With a base price starting at $35000 it seemed reasonable to own a luxury electric car. Elon and the company did not stop there.

The dream of having a complete EV revolution means that at some point the base model cars have to be competitive enough to where other people will stop buying the gasoline counterparts.

Tesla motors have now made that possible with a new vehicle called the Model 2. With rumors of this compact electric vehicle costing between $19000 to $25000 it makes owning a Tesla very affordable.

How Tesla Beats The Competition

I can hear it already from the Nissan Leaf owners who claim they have the best electric car. I can hear the Chevrolet Bolt owners squawking about the same thing.

Here is the deal as cool as those cars are the Tesla Model 2 will wipe the floor with them. Tesla has better tech better batteries and far more data on EVs than both of those cars combined. I could go on but I will stop right there.

Conclusion

Tesla is lightyears ahead of everyone in the EV game. Maybe Nissan could have pulled something together if the Leaf wasn't such a garbage pile (no offense Leaf owners but the car just is not that great).

Tesla road mapped everything out and has been fulfilling its promises since 2006. Thanks Elon; keep at it.

In the 1970s the United States produced what might be considered one of the worst anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) of all time. The M47 Dragon was slow quirky and took forever to reach its target.

But less than twenty-five years later the United States produced one of the best anti-tank missiles in the world the Javelin. How did the United States manage to turn around its infantry anti-tank program so quickly?

Infantry anti-tank weapons were a relatively weak area of the U.S. military throughout most of the Cold War. While the BGM-71 TOW was an excellent vehicle-mounted ATGM for its time it was not readily infantry-mobile. The tripod launch unit and sight for the TOW weigh in at more than 200 pounds.

Lighter anti-tank duties fell to the M72 Light Anti-Tank Weapon rocket launcher M47 Dragon light ATGM and the M67 90mm recoilless rifle. The M47 Dragon began to replace the M67 after its adoption in 1975 but the M67 stuck around in specialized roles.

But what made the M47 Dragon bad?

The primary reason is the Dragon’s propulsion system. Instead of a simple arrangement of a continuous burn rocket motor and fins the M67 Dragon featured many rings of tiny rocket engines which “popped” off in short bursts to adjust the missile’s flight path.

This lead to a myriad of downsides. The missile’s guidance was erratic with the missile jumping around in flight as the bursts fired off.

The bursts were loud and distinctive—they would warn a target that a Dragon had been fired and was closing on them.

Finally in certain environmental conditions the bursts could leave a trail of smoke puffs which could give away the position of the gunner.

The burst-engine method didn’t even make the missile fast. In fact it was slower than most of its counterparts taking over eleven seconds to reach its effective range of 1 kilometer out.

Guidance itself was accomplished by tracking an infrared flare on the rear of the missile similar to the TOW. This meant that the Dragon could be defeated by the Soviet and Russian Shtora active protection system.

The Dragon was usable at night but doing so required an additional night-sight that needed even more equipment. Canisters of freon were used to cool the night sight’s sensors but this only was effective for two hours.

The United States would upgrade the M47 Dragon into the Dragon II and Super Dragon which boosted the range and penetrating power of the missile. But these upgrades didn’t solve the primary flaw of the Dragon the propulsion system.

By the 1980s the United States was looking into replacing the Dragon. The program was initially called the Advanced Anti-Tank Weapon System–Medium. (AAWS-M)

After a competitive process that ruled out a laser-beam riding missile and a fiber-optic link missile (similar to the Israeli Spike) the Texas Instruments entry won the contract and began developing the Javelin.

Practically every aspect of the Javelin builds upon a flaw of the M47 Dragon.

Gone is the old night sight that required bottles of coolant. A self-cooling day/night thermal sight with multiple modes of zoom is a key part of the Javelin the Command Launch Unit.

The missile itself has a thermal seeker as well as opposed to being simply controlled by the firing post. This makes it significantly more resistant to Shtora-style active protection systems.

The long delay between missile launch and impact for the Dragon was likely a large factor that led to the selection of the Javelin for AAWS-M. The Javelin is a fire-and-forget missile which means that the gunner can immediately move after firing cutting out the missile flight time factor almost completely with regards to the crew repositioning.

The top-attack trajectory and conventional rocket engine greatly reduce the chances that an enemy tank will see or hear a Javelin launch compared to a Dragon launch.

Overall the Javelin was better than the Dragon in practically every way. In contrast to the Dragon which was only exported to a handful of countries the Javelin has been a major success worldwide (despite its cost) with major sales to the UK France and Australia.

Intel and Texas Instruments are the two most religiously inclusive workplaces among the United States’ 200 largest companies according to the 2021 Corporate Religious Equity Diversity and Inclusion Index (REDI Index) published on 9th February. American Airlines American Express Google and PayPal also earned top scores.

The REDI Index measures the religious inclusion of Fortune 100 and Fortune 200 companies in three categories: promotion of religion on their website’s diversity page number of company-sponsored religious employee resource groups (also referred to as ERGs) and whether they host public trainings on religious diversity.

The Religious Freedom & Business Foundation launched the REDI Index last year. According to Brian Grim the organisation’s founding president the Index aims to “highlight the best practices of companies who are making their workplaces faith-and-belief-friendly in the hopes that they become models for other companies”.

Intel which ranked second on the REDI Index last year overtook Google last year’s top company by 10 points in 2021. Intel’s public conference on religious inclusion earned it the extra boost.

Intel’s ranking is also thanks in part to its ERGs. Six of Intel’s 33 company-sponsored ERGs are explicitly faith or belief-based including a group for “Agnostics Atheists and Allies”.

Intel is also the only Fortune 200 company to have a group dedicated to Baha’i a religion based largely in the Middle East with about 8.5 million followers worldwide.

“You have one of the largest most successful big companies in the world recognising one of the smallest – in terms of numbers – world religions in the world and including them” said Grim. “That’s just a picture of what goes on inside of Intel. There’s a place at the table for everyone.”

Texas Instruments was one of the first companies in corporate America to incorporate religion into its diversity efforts – its Muslim Christian and Jewish ERGs have been around since 2001.

“These groups often collaborate and host events with each other and across other TI employee resources groups” said Yesenia Moore Texas Instruments’ vice president of diversity and inclusion in an email to Religion News Service. She said the goal of these gatherings is to “provide our employees with opportunities to learn more about their colleagues’ beliefs and traditions.”

While not all the top-scoring companies are in tech many are. Grim suggested that prioritizing spirituality in such competitive fields could give companies an edge. “When workplaces are inclusive around topics that matter to you it becomes not just a place where you’re collecting your paycheck but a place where you want to stay” he said.

This year the REDI index added Fortune 200 companies to its assessment. The results showed that a company’s size doesn’t necessarily predict its religious inclusivity – both Intel (a Fortune 100 company) and Texas Instruments (a Fortune 200 company) earned the same top score of 29.

American Airlines and American Express both Fortune 100 companies tied for third with Fortune 200 company PayPal. All three companies followed seven points behind the top scorers.

Grim said that while only about 20% of Fortune 100 companies currently have company-sponsored ERGs dedicated to belief or religion other companies are starting to catch on.

“Now companies like Intel Texas Instruments and Google are holding public seminars to share their best practices with other companies” said Grim. “I see that as a sign that this isn’t just niche but is now mainstream.”

Between 2020 and 2021 seven Fortune 100 companies added religious inclusion to their diversity efforts and achieved a score on the REDI Index for the first time. The Religious Freedom & Business Foundations’ Faith@Work Conference in early February also highlighted the growing momentum around religious inclusion – the conference hosted 75 companies and 400 participants including 11 Fortune 500 executives.

“These corporations are modeling how to come together around the freedom to have faith change it or have no faith at all” said Grim. “And they’re embracing that freedom in a way that isn’t political or divisive but is inclusive of everyone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JheS1wb2xsb2NrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY5MDkzNDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ray Pollock Obituary (1920 - 2021) - Spring TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/ray-pollock-obituary?id=6909341 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JheS1wb2xsb2NrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTY5MDkzNDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Stone a retired English professor from Arkansas State University started gathering doghouses and taking them to people’s homes for outside dogs.

“I bought my truck aware that there is a problem and even if the [doghouses] are nasty I will pick them up and take them to car washes and clean them” Stone said. “Some of the businesses donate food and hay and that helps.

“Because of COVID-19 more people are in a desperate situation. Right now I am the one taking care of the dogs and I need a little help and I’m asking people to donate whatever they are no longer using.”

She said many people in the area will drop off doghouses at her home Tractor Supply Co. donates food and the farm store often supplies hay. She said she also takes wormer to area dogs whose families cannot provide the medicine and re-homes dogs who must be surrendered. She said that right before the snowstorm she delivered four doghouses hay and 50-pound bags of food in a 60-mile radius.

“I’m not asking for money but I’m asking for help because it has gotten bigger than just me” Stone said. “I can haul three doghouses in my truck and two bales of hay.”

Stone said that when the local animal shelter hears of dogs that are being neglected the shelter sends her the addresses.

“Between the texts and private messages and the animal shelter that’s how I get the contact information” Stone said. “Ninety-nine percent of the time people are home and they are thrilled to see me. There is a tiny percentage who are offended and refuse help.”

Dianne Jones president of the board for the Heber Springs Humane Society said Stone receives phone calls and messages from people all over the county for dogs and animals that need shelter.

“We have given her doghouses and bales of hay to help with her project” Jones said. “Anyway she can help she will do it. She takes doghouses to owners [whose dogs] need the shelter. … She is an advocate of homeless animals and animals in need which is also our mission.”

Jones said Heber Springs has a population of under 8000 and is a close-knit community.

“We do have a lot of people who need help feeding their animals” she said.

“We have a sense that there are a lot of people who are in need and out of work” Jones said. “We are a rural community. We have animals that are surrendered to us [by people who] can’t afford to take care of them feed them or vaccinate them or [the animals are] injured.

“We help people in Heber Springs and Cleveland County as well as Quitman Pangburn and Greers Ferry. We reach out to those areas and help where we can.”

Jones said the shelter stays full with about 70 dogs and 35 cats. The Heber Springs Humane Society is at 49 Shelter Lane. For more information call (501) 362-7322.

Stone has worked with the shelter since 1977 and she said she “just has a huge soft spot for dogs.”

“It is woven into the fabric of who I am” Stone said. “I can’t help it.”

“Priscilla is someone that the community knows and they call her and try to help” Jones said. “She is just a wonderful person who uses her own truck gas and her money and gets the most out of it.

“She takes food where it is needed and she is great about it.”

Stone lives in downtown Heber Springs and has three dogs on her property three on her son’s property and one on her daughter’s. She said all seven dogs are rescues.

Stone said anyone who wants to help can donate new or used doghouses and she will come pick them up in a 40-mile radius. Donated dog food hay and straw are also accepted. Financial donations can be made to the Heber Springs Humane Society and earmarked “Stone.” She said donations are tax-deductible.

Stone who has also recently rescued and re-homed horses in the past couple of months said those interested in helping with that project can text her at (501) 691-1558.

The test reports will be issued on the spot before letting the travelers go an official spokesman said.

In a meeting convened here as part of the preventive plan in-charge Divisional Commissioner Kashmir Shahid Iqbal Choudhary issued directions for putting in place required measures to avert the spread of coronavirus in the Valley the spokesman said.

Choudhary directed for strengthening the preventive mechanism at the Srinagar airport instructing the Srinagar and Budgam district administrations to set up additional coronavirus testing facilities to enable quick receipt of the test reports.

He instructed that no inbound traveller be allowed to leave the airport until their COVID-19 test report is received the spokesman said.

He said the instructions come in the wake of a recent trend within Kashmir which shows a greater number of infections in travellers compared to local cases of COVID-19 infections.

The spokesman said it has been decided that those travellers whose reports come positive would be isolated in order to prevent transmission and spread of the infection among the local population.

Relevant protocol as given in the COVID-19 SOP manual will be followed in the case he said.

The meeting was informed that those with 48-hour-old RT-PCR negative reports from their departing cities will not have to undergo testing at the Srinagar airport.

Earlier while speaking during the meeting Director Health Services Kashmir Dr Samir Mattoo said the COVID-19 situation is under control.

The transmission rate is also quite low but stricter measures at the airport have to be taken to avert rise in infections he said.

It was informed that a rise in the positive cases as reported in some states outside J-K along with the recent trend of finding more infections in inbound travellers has necessitated taking these preventive measures as directed the spokesman said. PTI SSB AQS AQS

On Friday the Texas-based theme park operator announced plans to reopen all 26 of its locations for the 2021 season including five locations that stayed closed in 2020 due to continued coronavirus restrictions.

The company further confirmed its intention of hiring “thousands of team members” for the upcoming season exclusively via online hiring events.

“Our guests and team members are ready for the return of fun and signature Six Flags thrills in 2021” said Senior Vice President of Park Operations Bonnie Weber in a press release. “Last year we set the standard for operating our parks safely and entertained millions of guests in adherence to government and CDC health guidelines at 21 of our 26 parks.”

Weber added that the company is currently working to “set firm reopening dates” for its parks in California Illinois Massachusetts Mexico City and Canada.

Six Flags warned that its reopening dates while planned for 2021 were also subject to change depending on local state or federal guidelines.

Six Flags had initially shut down its theme park operations in mid-March of 2020 only reopening its first location — Frontier City in Oklahoma — on June 5. Twenty of its other parks followed by the end of the year all with new cleaning hygiene and social-distancing protocol in place.

Other policy changes included face coverings and temperature checks for guests and employees; a new online reservation system to be used by guests prior to booking a visit; limited capacity at all parks; and the switchover to credit card or mobile payments only to minimize contact between guests and vendors.

On its website Six Flags still warns guests to “evaluate their own risk” before deciding whether to attend its parks.

“People who show no symptoms can spread Coronavirus if they are infected any interaction with the general public poses an elevated risk of being exposed to Coronavirus” reads the site. “By coming to the park you acknowledge and agree that you assume these inherent risks associated with attendance.”

Six Flags CEO Mike Spanos however had said the parks were ready to embrace a “new normal” after the reopening of its Frontier City location in June 2020.

“This ’new normal’ will be very different but we believe these additional measures are appropriate in the current environment” Spanos said.

Here's what he learned.,"When Covid-19 shut down the U.S. economy in March Elon Musk had a rocket to launch.

The billionaire's space exploration venture SpaceX was planning to blast a crewed spacecraft into the sky in May and wanted to stay on schedule. That meant finding a way to keep facilities safely open and limit the spread of Covid-19 a challenge when tests were in short supply.

To monitor the prevalence of the virus among SpaceX workers nationwide Mr. Musk and the rocket company's top medical executive worked with doctors and academic researchers to build an antibody-testing program. More than 4000 SpaceX workers volunteered for monthly blood tests.

This week the group published its findings which suggest that a certain threshold of antibodies might provide people lasting protection against the virus. Mr. Musk is listed as a co-author of the peer-reviewed study which appears in the journal Nature Communications.

""People can have antibodies but it doesn't mean they are going to be immune"" to Covid-19 said Galit Alter a co-author of the study who is a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH MIT and Harvard. Individuals who experienced fewer milder Covid-19 symptoms generated fewer antibodies and were therefore less likely to meet the threshold for longer-term immunity the study found.

The idea is one that other researchers are exploring as they and public-health officials try to understand Covid-19 immunity.

""To really nail this down at a public-health level would require doing reinfection studies and following people for reinfection"" over time said Joshua T. Schiffer associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's vaccine and infectious-disease division.

As vaccines roll out slowly across the globe the scientists who studied SpaceX workers say their findings could be used to inform who is most vulnerable to the virus and should be vaccinated first. For example those with no antibodies in areas with high case counts could get priority Dr. Alter said.

Companies from Alphabet Inc.'s Google to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Amazon.com Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc. offer Covid-19 diagnostic tests to get a moment-in-time snapshot of who is infected. Few businesses have regularly tested worker blood samples for antibodies.

COVID-19 VACCINATION DELAYS COULD BRING MORE VIRUS VARIANTS IMPEDE EFFORTS TO END PANDEMIC

Representatives for Space Exploration Technologies Corp. the official name of the closely held Southern California company declined to comment on the testing.

Mr. Musk who is chief executive officer of SpaceX and of Tesla Inc. and has decried shutdown orders took a personal interest in the research and had the scientists brief him and top SpaceX executives during the pandemic on how antibodies and vaccines work Dr. Alter said.

Mr. Musk in November said he tested positive for the virus. ""Mild sniffles & cough & slight fever past few days"" he tweeted at the time.

Dr. Alter who studies immunology and the molecular mechanisms of how antibodies fight diseases created at the start of the year high-throughput Covid-19 antibody testing. Her work attracted investments from the hedge-fund manager Nancy Zimmerman former Soros Fund Management CEO Mark Schwartz and his wife Lisa Schwartz as well as a host of philanthropies (among them the Musk Foundation) and government agencies.

In April 2020 when Covid tests were scarce SpaceX contacted Eric Nilles an infectious-disease expert at Harvard and he enlisted Dr. Alter's help.

Together with SpaceX's medical director Anil Menon they built a testing program. SpaceX recruited workers from California to Florida who were willing to have their blood tested monthly starting in April.

ELON MUSK CONGRATULATES NASA AFTER SUCCESSFUL PERSEVERANCE LANDING ON MARS

Before the pandemic Dr. Menon had set up medical facilities at SpaceX worksites across the country. SpaceX has sent astronauts and aims to eventually send civilians into orbit. He used some of those facilities to quickly scale up blood-drawing stations and recruited medical interns from local hospitals to collect samples.

In May SpaceX launched a successful test flight of its Dragon capsule in Florida carrying two astronauts.

In June samples Dr. Alter processed from local workers foretold worsening cases in Texas. Instead of a typical 3% positivity rate for the virus 12% of the samples suggested infection. She reran them multiple times and confirmed that they were correct which led the company to send infected workers home and advise them to isolate.

Of the roughly 4000 SpaceX workers tested multiple times 300 became infected with Covid-19. Researchers had enough data on 120 people to dig deeper into their infections and subsequent levels of antibodies to draw conclusions in the study.

The median age of that small sample was 31 and 92% of them were male which the authors acknowledge might skew their findings because people of different ages and backgrounds present different immune-system responses. The study included test results between April and June.

""The good news is most of the vaccines induce [antibody] levels way higher than these levels"" for people who get both doses Dr. Alter said. ""So far it is pretty clear that we are hitting levels that are orders of magnitude higher with vaccination.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that having antibodies may provide some protection but it is unknown how long it may last. Researchers and diagnostic companies are working to understand what level of antibodies confers immunity.

""It would be great to have a clear numerical cutoff to say...above this level [of antibodies] you're protected below you're not but we don't have such a cutoff right now"" said Philip Dormitzer Pfizer Inc.'s viral-vaccine research-and-development chief.

SpaceX and its research partners continue testing each month and are now monitoring for reinfection particularly as mutations spread researchers involved in those efforts said. So far they have observed some reinfection among workers who were found to have low levels of Covid-19 antibodies in past testing.

In November the company launched four astronauts into orbit as part of its first operational mission with humans on board.

Things like slavery. Or putting out ads that we don't like. Uh there's a pretty wide spectrum when we're talking about bad stuff companies do. Here's a look at just a little of all that awful stuff ...

1. Philip Morris

Smoking kills which is bad. In particular it can be bad for the economy which is why the Czech Republic seemed ready to crack down on smoking in 1999. So Phillip Morris commissioned a study that basically said ""Actually people smoking saves the government money."" Because so many people die before they become a burden.

2. Walmart

Realizing that employees drive home at the end of each day Walmart tried to get them to deliver goods in addition to their other jobs. With their own cars own gas and own insurance. For $2 per delivery. Workers were not keen to sign on.

3. Universal Pictures

Why is Hollywood the moviemaking capital? Because at the start of the 20th century Thomas Edison owned patents on moviemaking and Universal didn't want to pay him. So they went as far west as they could to escape the long arm of the law.

4. Amazon

Warehouses are famously backbreaking. But you may be especially disgusted to learn how Amazon has tried convincing workers that they're not working: by making labor into a video game. Electronic panels in the warehouse aisles run programs called MissionRacer and CastleCrafter registering employee tasks and pitting them against each other multiplayer-style.

5. Chiquita

In addition to their more well-known history of creating an actual coup and civil war in Guatemala Chiquita has funded several terrorist groups. It took the US fining them $25 million to convince them to stop.

7. Atlas Logistics

When someone pooped on the warehouse floor -- not a great situation to have to deal with to be fair -- Atlas Logistics made employees submit DNA samples so they could track down the culprit. This is illegal and two workers who sued won $2.2 million.

8. Breitbart

One representative story to sum up Breitbart's commitment to the truth: In 2014 they reported that attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch had represented the Clintons over the Whitewater scandal. They were mixing her up with a different woman with the same name. So they issued a correction ... but left the original false statement as the article's headline.

9. UPMC

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center heard that many employees were complaining about low wages which meant they couldn't afford food for Thanksgiving. So they offered a solution: an employee food bank. Food would be donated by other employees.

10. Minnetonka

In the 1970s the company Minnetonka wanted to patent liquid soap. This was impossible because they hadn't invented it. So Minnetonka did the next best thing and bought up all 100 million plastic pumps available for soap dispensers. No other companies could make them and Minnetonka had a monopoly.

11. Ashley Furniture

Something seemed strange about this furniture chain. With 1000 injuries among just 4500 people in three years this was enough that the government fined them a couple million. Apparently the factory had a problem with ensuring chopping machines were off before letting fingers come nearby.

12. Range 702

In 2014 a Nevada gun range let a nine-year-old girl handle an Uzi submachine gun. Unable to brace against the gun's recoil she fatally shot the instructor. This gun range was not Range 702 which we're calling out today. Range 702 was the neighboring gun range who responded to the shooting by saying they still welcome children: ""It's an adrenaline rush for sure.""

14. High Plains Wireless

In 1994 the FCC auctioned off segments of the wireless spectrum. High Plains Wireless and other companies colluded to claim segments and keep prices down for the auction ... by inserting secret codes into the dollar amounts of the actual bids.

15. A-1 Pictures

In case you needed another reason to avoid anime animators are paid by the frame which can force them into working ludicrous hours. One worker made headlines after putting in 600 hours in a month. That data comes from the hospital that treated him shortly before he killed himself.

16. HubSpot

When email marketing company HubSpot fired people it sent everyone else an email saying the laid-off employee would be ""using his superpowers in his next big adventure"" and threw a ""graduation"" party. They finally dispensed with this admitting the practice was ""disrespectful and misleading.""

17. Verizon

Along with buying the domain Verizon.com Verizon bought VerizonSucks.com just in case someone wanted to create a site about how much they suck. So someone who hated Verizon instead went and registered VerizonReallySucks.com. Verizon sued saying (falsely) that this was a trademark violation.

18. Goodwill

Goodwill pays some workers 41 cents per hour. It is legal to pay disabled workers this amount under a standard called the ""subminimum wage."" Proponents of the subminimum wage say that without it companies would not hire disabled workers at all.

19. American Express

In the '60s Anthony De Angelis claimed to control Italy's entire vegetable oil industry. As proof he said American Express vouched for him -- and they did because he paid them to. He used their backing to swindle investors out of $200 million claiming his warehouses were filled with valuable salad oil. They actually held seawater.

21. Amy's Baking Company

This place is mostly famous because Gordon Ramsay walked out of it calling the owners too rude even for him. It forbade employees from talking to each other saying doing so ""may result in possible harm."" It also confiscated all tips.

22. Listerine

Listerine was designed as a surgical antiseptic which has limited market reach. So the company invented the disease halitosis -- which is not in fact a disease though the word existed to describe bad breath -- and told people Listerine cures it. The ruse worked.

23. Washington Football Team

Back when the team was trying to dodge criticism for its ""Redskins"" name owner Dan Snyder decided to invite Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly to sit beside him for a game. This might have fooled some people. But not the Navajo who had in fact already voted Shelly out ... for previously associating with Snyder.

24. Beech-Nut Packing

This bacon seller back in the 1930s wanted people buying more bacon so they asked an ad company to sell it as a breakfast food. Using some misleading questions they got thousands of doctors to agree that eggs and bacon made for a healthy breakfast.

25. SunTrust

Layoffs are always bad sure. But SunTrust bank went a step further and after laying off employees asked them to be available to work for two more years for no pay. This was illegal and they had to drop the plan when the story went public.

26. DuPont

DuPont knew perfluorooctanoic acid was poisonous. They were warned then they confirmed it first with animal tests then with human ones. They still pumped hundreds of tons of the stuff into rivers and rubbed the stuff in their workers' faces resulting in thousands of lawsuits.

28. Chivas Regal

Sales were low for Chivas Regal until they decided to rebrand themselves as a premium whiskey. How? By suddenly jacking up the price without actually changing the beverage at all.

29. Yahoo

Yahoo and many other tech companies pay to freeze employees' eggs long-term so you can delay having children till your infertile years. Sounds generous right? They actually do that because they calculated it costs the company less than providing daycare.

30. Takata

In 2016 the US ordered Takata to recall their airbags from 64 million cars. Airbags that could sometimes explode debris into people's faces. Takata went on using the same basic type of bag though leading to new explosions and new recalls in the years that followed.

31. The Pan-American Coffee Bureau

This coffee consortium tricked Americans into thinking coffee is the default beverage by inventing the coffee break. Coffee breaks never made any sense -- at work you're usually welcome to drink coffee even if you're not on break -- but they made them a thing.

32. The Defeat Diabetes Foundation

We could do a whole list just of charities who spend surprisingly little from donations on their cause. Let's highlight the Defeat Diabetes Foundation which the FTC noted spends approximately zero percent of its proceeds on actually fighting diabetes.

33. Eli Lilly

To boost Prozac sales in 2002 Eli Lilly obtained a confidential list of patients suffering from depression and sent them all a free month's supply. Without doctors vetting the process the drugs found their way to people like a 16-year-old who actually didn't suffer from depression and someone who responded to the Prozac with a violent psychotic reaction.

36. Purdue

Drugmakers are now facing the consequences of starting an opioid epidemic in the US. So they've wised up and changed strategy to ... starting opioid epidemics abroad concentrating on the huge population of hungry buyers in China.

37. Guitar Center

Guitar Center was paying salespeople as little as $800 a month reasoning that you could make a bunch on top of that thanks to commissions. But no commissions emerged because after talking to sales staff shoppers bought everything at a website called Musician's Friend. A website owned by Guitar Center.

38. TurboTax

The government could easily prepare your tax return themselves since they know how much you owe. But they make you do it thanks to lobbying from tax preparers like Turbo Tax. As part of the lobbying deal Turbo Tax has to file taxes for some people for free but they bury that feature where you probably won't find it.

39. State Farm

In the '80s State Farm kept a list of 240 lawyers with orders that anytime a claim came in from one of them the agency had to deny it and investigate further no matter how straightforward it seemed. They ended up paying a $30 million settlement when someone pointed out the only apparent connection between the lawyers: They were all Jewish.

40. 7-Eleven

A bunch of 7-Eleven franchises found a new source of labor: smuggling immigrants into the country illegally. And then paying them only $3 an hour making them work 100-hour weeks. And also deducting from that salary rent since they had to live in housing the owners provided.

This Chicago company used keycards to track how long each employee spent in the bathroom and if an employee spent a whole day without going they rewarded them with a $1 gift card. We don't know if this story is better or worse when you learn WaterSaver deals in plumbing.

43. American Future Systems

To keep employees out of the bathroom you can also use the stick instead of the carrot. American Future Systems had to pay $1.75 million in a lawsuit after forcing employees to clock out before each time they took a piss.

44. Tyson Foods

The most extreme bathroom choice though involves just keeping workers out of the bathroom permanently. How? Make them all wear diapers. This would be disgusting at any company but especially bad at a place like Tyson Foods where those workers shitting themselves are packaging chicken products.

45. Nestle

Nestle has a famously evil history of selling places' water back to them but at least bottled water doesn't kill people. Their campaigns to sell baby formula in underdeveloped countries have killed people -- women who'd otherwise breastfeed mixed powdered formula with unsanitary water and poisoned babies.

46. De Beers

In the 19th century we discovered so many new diamond deposits that the mineral was no longer rare or valuable. Se De Beers formed to buy up every single diamond deposit in the world so they could control the supply and fix prices. Executives had to avoid U.S. soil for decades to escape being arrested.

47. Betty Crocker

When Betty Crocker introduced a cake mix mothers rejected it reasoning that instant food isn't real cooking. So Betty Crocker introduced a new mix that asked you to add one egg. This was needless (the old mix used powdered egg just fine) but it tricked mothers into thinking they were doing real baking after all.

GE pioneered a way of evaluating employees called ""stack rankings."" It assigns workers a score from 1 to 5 -- and for every person who gets 5 one person must get a 1. Turns out forcing managers to pick favorites and un-favorites is a lot better than plain rewarding performance at encouraging racism and sexism.

50. Coca-Cola

Coke introduced a program in restaurants called ""Cap the Tap"" which they claimed was a campaign against wasting water. It was actually a campaign to convince restaurants to stop serving tap water and serve Coca-Cola instead.

51. McDonald's

A McDonald's started giving employees debit cards attached to a bank account instead of just giving them paychecks. Convenient for employees who don't have their own accounts right? Withdrawing cash from the account costs $5 per transaction.

52. Shell

Shell has been pumping oil out of Nigeria for decades. On top of accepted stuff like bulldozing villages and spilling oil all over vegetation we have to highlight 1995 which was when they ordered the military to torture and kill nine environmental activists.

53. Alka-Seltzer

Alka-Seltzer realized they could sell twice as much if they convinced everyone to double the amount that they used. They introduced a new campaign with the tagline ""plop plop fizz fizz."" Drop two tablets in the glass urged the ads. So people did for no good reason.

54. Cabin Creek Mine

In 1912 the United Mine Workers went on strike. So the Cabin Creek Mine company in West Virginia brought in armored trains to the tent town the workers had set up and gunned 50 workers down. Things got even crazier in the 1920s when the mines now backed up by Army aircraft fought thousands of union members in a battle that used a million bullets.

Bank of America broke its record for new patents in 2020 with 444 granted patents and 722 applications filed. Those numbers are among the highest for the financial services industry for the year according to the latest list from the Intellectual Property Owners Association. AI and machine learning patents making up nearly one in five of the total.

AI Invention

In total Bank of America now has around 4400 patents held and filed placing it in the 15 holders of banking-related patents. This year continued the company’s growing use of AI for services for customers and staff members. Bank of America’s new Life Plan product uses predictive AI to give personalized financial advice based on client preferences while a new internal AI-powered service checks for errors and shares recommendations to a client service representative as they work with a customer.

“Bank of America clients benefit every day from our focus on innovation” chief operations and technology officer Cathy Bessant said in a statement. “Continuing to build our patent portfolio is one way that we measure our success. Invention happens across our company at an ever-increasing pace and our 2020 patent performance set records for our firm. Hats off to our teams for their creativity and brilliance.”

Bank Chat

Bank of America also gained new patents related to the voice-activated virtual financial assistant Erica. The AI responds more like a human now thanks to improved command dialogue software. Erica’s userbase has grown to 17 million and it has answered more than 230 million requests since it debuted in 2018. The pace accelerated in 2020 with a 67% year-over-year growth and more than 135 million requests and 58% of interactions taking place last year. A good chunk of those interactions revolved around the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank taught Erica more than 60000 phrases and questions related to the virus to help field questions on the subject.

Bank of America’s push for new and improved voice and AI technology is part of a larger trend in the industry. Some are producing their own virtual assistants like the voice assistant U.S. Bank launched last summer and Russia’s Tinkoff Bank has been promoting its Oleg voice assistant for a while. There are also companies using existing voice assistants such as the Alexa and Google Assistant voice apps created by ICICI one of India’s largest private banks. On the other hand Russian banking giant Sberbank took the concept to the extreme by transforming its focus from finance to tech with a smart display and voice assistant now on sale.

Edwards becomes the fourth chief executive in five years at Tri-State one of 18 Black-owned banks open in the United States. He had led First Horizon Bank’s flagship Memphis office and recently retired as president of Paragon Bank in East Memphis.

Tri-State is replacing Darius Davis who resigned as CEO in December and returned to Maryland for personal reasons. A statement released Tuesday by the bank says: “Davis returned to his Baltimore area home as COVID-19 continues to hinder travel and relocation efforts.”

The leadership change at the bank which employs 22 people marks another chapter in a critical period. Tri-State lost $866000 last year according to an FDIC report marking its first profit loss since the difficult period following the nation’s 2008 economic crash when losses totaled $4.8 million between 2011 and 2014. The bank cut employment and loan volume particularly to churches and sold its Downtown headquarters site.

Edwards will step into a bank on sounder footing than back then. He said the 2020 loss reflects in part the struggle of churches repaying construction loans after the pandemic cut tithing.

He has headed the bank for five weeks and will launch a search to recruit a new CEO later in the year. Until then the bank will sell a vacant acre on Winchester purchased for a possible branch office and look into attracting more customers online.

""We need to grow our loans and improve our return on our loans” Edwards said.

Tri-State founded in the city in 1946 by African American insurance executives Joseph E. Walker and Maceo Walker ranks among Memphis’ smaller banks though it is widely known as one of the largest Black-owned businesses in the Mid-South as well as one of the nation’s few surviving Black-owned banks. More than three dozen banks owned by African Americans operated two decades ago throughout the United States. The closures are generally attributed to consumers moving their business to larger banks and economic problems among African Americans.

The bank originated near Beale Street when the Downtown district was home to one of the country’s largest concentrations of businesses owned by and serving African Americans. By 2001 Tri-State employed 72 workers and had booked $73.6 million in loans and $117.4 million in customer deposits. As the 2008 recession came on the bank cut back to 44 employees and deposits dropped to $71.4 million.

Five years ago Memphis-based First Tennessee now named First Horizon and Memphis real estate investor Belz Investco injected money into the bank. First Tennessee bought $1.5 million worth of Tri-State preferred stock and Belz purchased the bank’s headquarters property at Beale and Main streets for $3 million.

The actions helped increase Tri-State’s lifeblood known as equity capital which had been depleted as Memphians missed loan payments after the 2008 economic crash saddled the city with high unemployment for the next seven years.

Thomas Felder the CEO hired to stabilize the bank led its relocation from 180 Main to a new headquarters in a high-rise office building at 1407 Union Ave. and also enhanced its presence at a prominent location in Whitehaven making the office at 4606 Elvis Presley Blvd. the key location for serving customers. The 90000-population Whitehaven area is home to a large share of the city’s African American middle- and working-class families.

Felder succeeded Christine Munson a retired First Tennessee corporate banking executive hired in 2016 by Tri-State. She promoted a millennial plan aimed at bringing in more customers in their 20s and 30s. Felder was succeeded in 2018 by Davis.

In a statement released by Tri-State the bank’s chairman of the board Memphis real estate investor Archie Willis III says:

“We are grateful for Darius’ leadership. We understand his desire and decision to be with his family amid the ongoing pandemic. We are thrilled Mike has joined us. And we are confident in his ability to lead our team and help us grow. He comes to us at a time when the Bank is also navigating the challenges around the Corona virus and its impact on African American customers and businesses.”

Tri-State at the end of September held $90.2 million in customer deposits and had booked $51.2 million worth of loans and leases. Equity capital totaled $10.5 million. The numbers are shown in reports to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjEvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGFuLWdlcnRsZXItc2FuY3Rpb25zLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tough Sanctions Then a Mysterious Last-Minute Turnabout (Published 2021),"WASHINGTON — In early December an Israeli billionaire named Dan Gertler made an unusual request to the Treasury Department.

A skateboarding world champion is among five people prosecutors in Southern California have charged with organizing parties that were possible superspreader events amid the pandemic.

Nyjah Huston a four-time world skateboarding champion and Edward Essa the owner of a home in the Fairfax District in Los Angeles held a party last month with at least 40 people that was shut down by police after receiving a complaint. At least two other parties were held at the home last fall authorities said.

Huston and Essa were both charged with creating a nuisance a misdemeanor. Neither could be reached for comment the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.

The Jan. 9 party took place when coronavirus cases were surging at an unprecedented rate following the holidays. Hospitals had exhausted their ICU beds capacity and officials were constantly urging residents not to gather in large groups.

Officers had previously shut down events at the home on Sept. 12-13 and Oct. 17 and issued warnings to the residents that large gatherings violated the mayor’s public order officials said.

KALAMAZOO Mich. — Five years have not eased the pain for Laurie Smith who lost her husband and son in the Kalamazoo shootings. But she and her daughter Emily say they have found comfort and a focus through their grief.

Laurie says ""I miss him more than I could ever tell you and Tyler I don't even know how to explain how much I miss him.""

Laurie Smith's husband Rich and teenage son Tyler were the first two people shot and killed by Jason Dalton. Time hasn't made the loss any easier for Laurie or her daughter Emily.

Emily Smith-Lemmer says ""To me the longer it goes the longer that it's been since February 20 2016 it's like more painful.""

Rich Smith and his son Tyler were best buddies they loved anything with a throttle. That night Rich and Tyler Smith stopped at a car dealership lot to look at trucks in the parking lot.

Emily says she planned to go with them but she fell asleep and when she woke up her life was changed. ""That guilt is always going to be there but now it's like okay Emily even if you were there there is absolutely nothing that they could do or what I could do.""

Some things haven't changed in five years.

Laurie still wears her wedding ring. She still lives in their house surrounded by photos and memories but now Emily and her three-year old daughter live with her. Laurie says ""She's very aware. Very aware of who Grandpa and Uncle T.T. are.""

Emily says her daughter is literally a spitting image of both of her brother and her father. Emily says ""I have a picture of her doing the same exact face as my brother and they look identical. And she's got a lot of my dad in her too so it's kinda cool to see she's really my saving grace.”

At Mattawan High School five years later a pine tree is growing. It’s a living memorial to Tyler who was a student and a member of the soccer team.

The Cracker Barrel Restaurant where four others were killed in the parking lot five years ago has since closed.

Emily says the tragedy created a family among the family members and survivors. She says they are a family because they went through the trial together and share the same date. That same date February 20. 2016 means the same thing to all of them.

Five years later Jason Dalton is serving his life sentence at the Oaks Correctional Facility in Manistee.

Emily says her parents instilled in her that it’s not right to hate and you should love everyone. She says she tried very hard to hate Jason Dalton but she can’t.

Laurie’s faith inspired her to start the ""Forever Strong Foundation"" a non-profit organization to give back to the community.

She says she has faith that she’s going to get through it and she’s not going to give up. She’ll continue giving through “Forever Strong.”

The families stay connected through a private Facebook page. That includes the two survivors Tiana Carruthers and Abbie Kopf.

On Saturday Feb. 20 they will commemorate the five-year anniversary with an online prayer event. The community is encouraged to participate. Visit the Forever Strong Foundation's Facebook for more details.

A new podcast was just released about the Kalamazoo Shootings. ""The Daily Crime"" is one of the top ten true crime podcasts. The producers interviewed Juliet Dragos for the show. You'll find ""The Daily Crime Kalamazoo Shooting Spree"" on Apple or wherever you listen to podcasts.

Laurie Smith released this statement concerning the anniversary:

As we approach the upcoming five year anniversary of the Kalamazoo mass shooting we not only want to remember the lives lost and forever changed on that tragic night... but also want to celebrate those beautiful souls and share love grace strength and hope with the community. Forever Strong Memorial Foundation would like to invite anyone who has experienced loss or tragedy of any kind in the past or maybe you're going through it right now to send us as email at foreverstrongfoundation@gmail.com so that on the evening of the 20th and beyond we can pray for you. Your email can be as vague or detailed as you like. We will not share it or your info with anyone other than God in prayer. God created all of us for community to love one another. And although we cannot physically get together with you all right now. We want to get together virtually and ask our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to bless you with comfort health strength love and hope for a better tomorrow.

We love you all and are so humbled by the outpouring of kindness and love and support that you all have shown us over the past five years.

Forever Strong Memorial Foundation will provide opportunities to gather together in person as soon as it is safe to do so. But in the meantime we wanted to reach out and offer this opportunity for prayer and hope through our faith. Because forever we are strong together.

In 2003 the film director Barbara Kopple set out to make a documentary about the work of five female reporters in Iraq. In Bearing Witness Kopple—best known for her Oscar-winning portrayal of a grueling coal miners’ strike in Appalachia—turned her camera on the work of women reporting war. She showed the sexism and grittiness but also women struggling with personal travails and demons—alcoholism loneliness and in my case as one of the women combining motherhood with war.

Kopple wanted to portray women deeply committed to their job—truth-telling under the most hostile circumstances—while trying to be taken seriously in an uber-macho world.

Reading Elizabeth Becker’s new book You Don’t Belong Here: How Three Women Rewrote the Story of War I realize how little changed in terms of infiltrating an old boys’ club between Vietnam where Becker’s book is set and Iraq three decades later. Even today—despite massive changes in technology and the way the press covers war—all of the hallmarks of clubby sexism and bias remain.

In Becker’s compelling book three extraordinary women—Catherine Leroy Frances “Frankie” FitzGerald and Kate Webb—arrive in Vietnam at the height of the war to try to depict the conflict in unique ways. Each is determined to make her mark and to make the war her own. Each becomes captivated by the country drawn in deeply and committed to the people and culture. They are equally appalled by the horror of the atrocities and intent on bringing to light the murky U.S. foreign policy in the region.

Leroy—angry intense driven—takes enormous personal risk to shoot intense close photographs that highlight the raw emotion of war: the fear the mud the boredom and the chaos. What she suffers—the isolation the sneers at her physical appearance after she’d spent grueling days working in the field and the hard battle she fought just to be accredited as a press photographer by the U.S. military—is infuriating. Her sheer courage and plucky determination to keep going despite getting little support and comradery makes her to me the most compelling if self-destructive character in the book.

Webb at a refugee camp during the Vietnam War circa 1968.

Webb also exemplifies courage. She insisted on going down roads and into the field even when it was far too dangerous and ended up getting captured by the North Vietnamese. Her death was widely reported. Her family mourned her and began preparation for memorial services. Yet several weeks later Webb marched out of a field stricken with malaria half-dead but alive enough to recount the story of her capture.

FitzGerald a beautiful debutante from a wealthy family cast a unique light by portraying the war from all three sides—U.S. South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese—and winning respect from her colleagues. Her groundbreaking history of Vietnam Fire in the Lake is still regarded as one of the most profound and comprehensive studies of the war. (In 1980 she also became one of the first women to join the editorial board of Foreign Policy.)

But all of them were derided at the time. Becker told me she took the title of her book from a remark made to Leroy by a male French photographer who later apologized to her for the statement. Sir Don McCullin the much-lauded English photographer echoed what these women had to endure in an essentially hostile male-dominated environment while working under conditions of great duress: “[Leroy] did not want to be a woman amongst men but a man amongst men. Why would a woman want to be amongst the blood and carnage?” For McCullin to say this shows how tough the three women’s job was and how determined they were to stick it out for so long.

The three women Becker chose to tell the story of the war couldn’t have been more different. Leroy was tiny and French feisty and gutsy a master parachutist and a loner. She loved fashion. “[S]he had become Saigon’s Twiggy” Becker writes. Leroy was as free with her sexuality as most of the men were—but she was a woman and got labeled with the sobriquet “slut” Becker told me. But Leroy was also headstrong devoted to getting the photograph and willing to push past any man to get the shot she needed—hence annoying the hell out of them. Decades later my comrades in the field—female photographers and camerawomen—suffered the same fate.







Leroy also unabashedly spoke her mind an attribute that did not hold her dear to the mostly male press corps. In one particularly cringeworthy scene Becker describes a furious Leroy beautifully dressed strutting on stage to accept a coveted award in New York City. But when she reaches the stage she begins lambasting her bosses and her colleagues to the horror of the audience. In another time one would applaud her: You go girl! But in the era that she lived and worked in she was shunned and avoided. After Vietnam she paused for a while before going on to do some of her best work in the civil war in Lebanon.

Webb came from Australia with a dark traumatic past and a determination to succeed. Quiet shy but steadfast she suffered untold humiliation as a reporter in a man’s world—and had to closet her femininity in order to be taken seriously. She became a hard-drinking chain-smoking skilled reporter and trusted colleague. She rose to run the UPI bureau in Phnom Penh—unheard of for a woman.

“Webb hated being called a girl reporter” Becker writes. “[S]he felt it was a way to dismiss her accomplishments.” Yet she was a woman with a woman’s needs and wants often pushed to the side to accommodate a toughness she was forced to uphold.

FitzGerald was perhaps the luckiest of the lot. Her patrician ancestry included a father who was a CIA supremo and a mother who was a socialite lover of Adlai Stevenson and who later became the U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (mainly because of her connections to the Kennedy clan). FitzGerald’s father gave her a check for $100000 close to $1 million in today’s money when she graduated from Radcliffe College which allowed her to live well in Saigon on a freelance income. She never had to sleep in cheap hotels as Webb or Leroy did or fight to get paid properly.

Frances FitzGerald reports from the National LiberationFront in South Vietnam in 1973.

FitzGerald had a golden address book and on landing in Saigon she immediately became the girlfriend of Ward Just one of the most respected male reporters in the press corps. The relationship protected her from gossip and gave her an instant social life. She later had a romance with Kevin Buckley a Yale University graduate and Newsweek correspondent who helped her establish her credibility as a reporter.

FitzGerald’s Saigon was not a tough ascent like Webb’s or Leroy’s. When she fell ill her overbearing mother flew in and whisked her off to private hospitals and linen sheets in Singapore. When she wanted a break from war she flew to a distant cousin’s lush castle in Ireland. When she wanted to publish her essays the New Yorker and the Atlantic opened their doors to her.

Becker writes beautifully of the heartache the women suffer their struggles to be taken seriously the guffaws the catcalls the daily small humiliations.

Still despite her lofty credentials education and hard work and research FitzGerald was still not taken seriously until she published Fire in the Lake. She still had to struggle to be recognized as one of the few journalists to report the war from all three sides. Her commitment to the country was established. As Becker told me: “She was the only debutante reporting from Vietnam! She didn’t have to be there.”

What Becker really wanted to achieve with You Don’t Belong Here is a book about Vietnam told through the eyes of three women who loved the tragic country. “I wanted to write a book about Vietnam that was readable” she told me. “Narrative journalism—literary journalism that you could read [in order to] understand the Vietnam war through the eyes of these women.”

Becker finishes the book with her own story of how she came to work in Cambodia as a journalist and fell under the spell of Indochina writing extraordinary dispatches from the Khmer Rouge era. When Becker meets Webb for the first time in the Hong Kong airport—Becker is arriving in Asia and Webb is departing—Webb asks her why she left her safe home in Seattle to cover a war. Becker pauses and replies that Cambodia is integral to her studies—but in reality she is more intrigued by the escalation of the U.S. bombing campaign and the legacy of the women such as FitzGerald and Webb who worked in Vietnam before her.

Becker’s book does an excellent job of bringing back what my colleague in Bosnia the New York Times reporter John F. Burns once nostalgically called “that time that place of war.” She writes beautifully of the heartache the women suffer their struggles to be taken seriously the guffaws the catcalls the daily small humiliations that amounted to the French photographer’s fierce indictment: You don’t belong here.

But they did belong. And the proof is their legacy. Fire in the Lake stands next to the greatest historical records of the Vietnam War. Leroy’s startling images of wounded Marines being carried by their comrades are some of the best photographs of the war; her “Corpsman in Anguish” is iconic. And Webb much to the annoyance of her male colleagues will always be remembered as the first wire reporter to reach the U.S. Embassy in Saigon during the 1968 Tet Offensive hiding behind a wall taking notes and beating them to the scoop. Interestingly enough none of the three women had children and only FitzGerald married—and not until the age of 50. Leroy and Webb died too soon and tragically. But all of them are legends.

When I first went to cover the war in Bosnia in 1992 the last of the Vietnam press corps were still alive and still working. The stories they told over late-night whiskey and cigarettes with shelling and sniper fire in the background were often of these remarkable women whose work superseded the heavy obstacles they faced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTI4MjM4MS9Ib3ctdWJlci1MaWJlcmFsLU5pY2stQ2xlZ2ctbGl2aW5nLUNhbGlmb3JuaWFuLWRyZWFtLVNpbGljb25lLVZhbGxleS5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS05MjgyMzgxL2FtcC9Ib3ctdWJlci1MaWJlcmFsLU5pY2stQ2xlZ2ctbGl2aW5nLUNhbGlmb3JuaWFuLWRyZWFtLVNpbGljb25lLVZhbGxleS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How uber-Liberal Nick Clegg is living the Californian dream in Silicone Valley,"Nestled in the heart of California's Silicon Valley the sleepy hamlet of Atherton has been crowned 'America's most expensive zip code' for each of the past four years.

The average house costs £5 million and the 7000 uber-wealthy residents include tech titans Eric Schmidt former head of Google and Sheryl Sandberg Chief Operating Officer of Facebook.

Atherton screams 'new' money – and lots of it. But that doesn't stop the villagers priding themselves on impeccably liberal credentials.

In November's US Presidential election nearly 80 per cent of them cast their vote in favour of Democrat Joe Biden – and against Republican President Donald Trump.

What better place then to find Sir Nick Clegg the former Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader who is now Facebook's Vice-President for Global Affairs and Communications?

Life seems good for the 54-year-old who once led the Coalition Government with David Cameron. He shares a £7 million mansion with wife Miriam and gets by on a salary reported to be £2.7 million a year.

The average house in Atherton Silicone Valley costs £5 million and the 7000 uber-wealthy residents include tech titans Eric Schmidt former head of Google and Sheryl Sandberg Chief Operating Officer of Facebook. Pictured Nick Clegg's £7 million mansion

Clegg has taken to life here with ease. Before lockdown he was often seen cycling the three miles from his home to Facebook's Menlo Park HQ wearing workout clothes and flip-flops.

This is the man who once declared: 'If you scratch below the surface and ask what really makes me tick it's the liberalism of trying to promote freedom and opportunity.' So it seems an irony that Clegg's new life in the sunshine is funded by an organisation increasingly described as a threat to democracy.

Swing a cat here and you'll hit a billionaire

Last week Facebook caused consternation around the Western world. Faced with demands from an elected government that it pay for the news content it copies from others and promotes the tech giant reacted by censoring Australian Facebook pages and simply removing the news feeds.

Clegg is now at the heart of negotiations with the Australian government. Canada is threatening to introduce similar legislation.

The clouds have been gathering for some time. Google and Facebook already face demands that they be broken up with anti-trust suits against them in US courts.

And in their treatment of Trump – effectively silenced by Facebook and Twitter while he was still President – the tech giants have been described as both illiberal and unaccountable. Facebook with its 2.8 billion unique users a month wields more power than most countries – and knows it.

Mr Clegg is pictured with his wife Miriam González Durántez. Miriam 52 says life in Silicon Valley is 'a bit like living in the Vatican' adding: 'It's slightly insular massively wealthy. It's not so diversified and is mostly run by men'

Roger McNamee an early investor in the company said: 'Facebook has more monthly users than there are notional adherents to Christianity; roughly twice as many as there are people in China.

'When your numbers are that big your ego can give you the illusion that you are a nation state.'

Not that the Cleggs will meet much criticism in Atherton. Miriam 52 says life in Silicon Valley is 'a bit like living in the Vatican' adding: 'It's slightly insular massively wealthy. It's not so diversified and is mostly run by men.'

One local said: 'This is a place you find people driving Teslas rather than Lamborghinis. You can't swing a cat without hitting a billionaire but that's part of the charm. Gardeners maids and other service people come in at sunrise and leave at sunset. It's a safe haven for the super-rich and those aspiring to be.'

Lady Clegg works as a lawyer while running a charity called Inspiring Girls and cultivating a vegetable patch in the grounds of the couple's two-storey faux Queen Anne house built in 2009. With an acre of land huge outdoor swimming pool with hot-tub a sun deck and an outdoor fireplace the family have been well prepared for the privations of lockdown. The house has five bedrooms six bathrooms and a dining room that seats 16.

NO EXPENSE SPARED: The faux Queen Anne house was built in 2009

But they should enjoy it while they can. One Hollywood power-broker who met Clegg shortly before the pandemic struck said he faced an 'impossible' task of trying to promote the idea Facebook can be a self-regulating force for good rather than a behemoth which puts profits before people.

'He's the ultimate liberal living in the beating heart of liberal Silicon Valley yet he works for the most un-liberal company in the world' he said while adding that he found Clegg 'a very likeable guy'.

'He was basically brought into Facebook to help the company's image and that of Mark Zuckerberg personally. He went around the room promising to make the company more transparent saying it would be more accountable that it wouldn't just ignore criticism but would embrace it. Let's be honest – his job is akin to putting lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. But comparing Facebook to a pig is being unfair to pigs. Facebook has continued to put profits and growth before users' safety and privacy.'

Clegg's supporters point to improvements he has made since joining the company including helping to create an Oversight Board – an 'independent' committee which will have the ultimate say on content.

The Hollywood source added: 'He's not hated but he's not managed to score a huge victory. The jury's still out. He's facing a thankless task. The reality is probably he will move on head held high. But this has been a job that has given his family a life-altering income.'

For the first time since Facebook was founded in 2004 the world is waking up to the threat it poses – along with Google Amazon and the rest. But that's unlikely to ruffle the Cleggs in their Californian mansion as day by day the money keeps rolling in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY25hbGlmZXN0eWxlLmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9raW0ta2FyZGFzaGlhbi1kaXZvcmNlcy1rYW55ZS13ZXN0LTE4MjU4MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian and Kanye West: Tales of an uber celeb marriage gone wrong,"Social media doesn't always go well for Kanye.

After donning a red MAGA hat Kanye also made an appearance at the White House soon after Kim that year meeting with Trump and dropping an F-bomb during a hyper monologue that for a change left Trump fairly speechless.

Also in 2018: Kanye stopped by TMZ headquarters to declare 400 years of slavery was a choice. It wasn't until last year that Kim addressed her husband's erratic behaviour and struggles with mental illness.

""I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions"" she said on Instagram. ""He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man who experienced the painful loss of his mother and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words sometimes do not align with his intentions.""

YE AND GOD

Kanye's been talking about faith since his debut album The College Dropout in 2004. On the album's breakout single Jesus Walks he raps: ""They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus/That means guns sex lies videotape/But if I talk about God my record won't get played huh.""

Fast forward to 2019 and the birth of his born-again status and Sunday Service gospel gatherings he has held at home in Los Angeles and around the world. They've been well attended by celebrities from DMX to Kenny G Kim and her family have been right there in the mix.

Kanye's spiritual reset culminated in his ninth studio album Jesus is King. His faith has led him in other directions too like his tearful disclosure that he considered aborting North rather than going through with her birth. It was Kim he said who fought for their child.

THE GIFTING

He has showered his wife with jewels a hand-painted Birkin bag stock in blue chip companies and a stake in his own Yeezy brand. But one gift stands out: A hologram of her late father Robert Kardashian during her 40th birthday bash on an undisclosed island in the middle of the pandemic last October.

As Kim family members and close friends partied beachside hologram dad in a tan suit against a sparkly background of black and midnight blue spoke of being proud of the woman and mother she has become particularly her studies to become a lawyer like himself along with her support of his native Armenia.

There was also a plug for Kanye from the great beyond:

""You married the most most most most most genius man in the whole world Kanye West.""

THE STAKES

Yes they were a power couple but Kanye was successful in music before Kim came along and the two have made truckloads of money separately. Together Forbes estimates their combined net worth is in the US$2.1 billion range. Some crunch the numbers in his favour.

Forbes said their biggest assets are independently owned and operated businesses. Kanye has made it big in shoes and Kim rolls out beauty and attire on a regular basis. She also earned millions through the reality show that launched the family Keeping Up with the Kardashians. It's a show he reportedly wanted little to do with.

Kim's sale of a 20 per cent stake in KKW Beauty to giant Coty for US$200 million was completed this year.

There's also real estate and the mansion the two lavishly labored to trick out in Calabasas California along with their two Wyoming ranches."

I've used the same eyebrow pencil — Anastasia Beverly Hills in Ebony — since college when I first discovered what an eyebrow pencil was. I buy the same rose toner from Mamonde every month and I always use a lip balm from start to finish unless I lose it. When it comes to fragrances then I'm even more meticulous because only a handful of perfumes do not give me a headache.

To backtrack a bit my introduction into the perfume world started in middle school with mists. In 8th grade my clothes were enveloped in the cucumber melon scent from Bath & Body Works followed by Victoria Secret's signature Bombshell Body Mist — a potent syrupy scent housed in a bright pink bottle — when I entered high school. In using it I felt a closeness to Gisele Bündchen and all the other Angels who graced the ads during that time period. Mists which are less concentrated with fragrance oils compared to perfumes sat well with my teenage self until one day right before college I decided to invest in an ""adult"" scent.

That's how I came upon DKNY's Be Delicious perfume at Costco (don't ask me why it was sold there) during a food haul with my mother. I had kept a scent strip of Be Delicious from a magazine tear out in my drawer and it never gave me adverse reactions so I decided to invest in the full bottle. I've always been drawn to crisp refreshing scents that have a fruity note with some warmth to them (as you'll see below) and noticed perfumes that fell into this category never made me dizzy no matter how much I over spritzed. Such was the case with the mists Be Delicious and then Marc Jacobs Honey which I used religiously from junior year of college to the first few years of my early 20s. I could spray on 10 pumps of it which I did during my party days and not feel overwhelmed by the saccharine scent or worry that it would negatively affect other people's olfactory senses.

I was serially monogamous with perfumes — when I found one I liked and it didn't make me nauseous I stuck with it until either the product was discontinued (RIP Marc Jacobs Honey) or someone else gifted me a different scent. (I wasn't too fond of fragrance aisles at big department stores because of my sensitive nose.) When I officially ran out of Honey a few years ago I tepidly ventured down those same aisles I avoided to test out new scents always one or two at a time. Then I would beeline it out of there when I felt myself getting lightheaded by the medley of smells.

I also sourced my friends for perfume recommendations and one brand Jo Malone kept popping up in the discussion. I took home sample strips of a few different scents and one of my friends who knew I was veering towards the Poppy & Barley cologne gifted it to me last year for my birthday (right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit) and it hasn't left my shelf since.

(+) (+) Marina Liao INFO 1/2

In a way I'm grateful to have been forced to say goodbye to Honey as this opened me up to the wonderful world of perfumes from other luxury houses and emerging brands. Through trial and error plus multiple trips to Sephora for research (the perfume aisle still makes me dizzy if I spend too much time in there) I've come across many scents that have surprisingly pleased my senses.

Carina Chaz of Dedcool a unisex vegan fragrance brand shared some insights into why certain scents don't register well with individuals. ""When non-safe synthetics come into play it can be that 'overwhelming fragrance experience' due to the harmful ingredients such as phthalates and animal byproducts"" she tells TZR. ""Typically these 'headache-causing scents' are watered down and contain toxic ingredients like BHT a chemical preservative. When there are chemicals in the mix it can disrupt your hormones damage your skin or harm your body and the environment."" To summarize check the ingredients in all beauty products particularly in perfume purchases if like me you have sensitive skin or an extra sensitive nose. Everyone reacts to scents differently.

Currently my go-to fragrance is the Poppy & Barley cologne — I will use it until the last drop is gone — but there are a few other perfumes that have made it into my headache-free rotation. For those seeking to find your own signature scent that does give you a pounding migraine scroll through some of my picks ahead.

Ted Cruz's Feb. 18 flight from Cancun Mexico to Houston was leaked to the media.

What Happened: Cruz has been the subject of criticism after it was discovered he left Texas on Feb. 17 for a trip to Cancun with his daughters while many of his constituents were without power or water due to an unexpectedly harsh winter storm. When news of his Mexican excursion broke Cruz issued a statement saying that he was only accompanying his daughters to their vacation destination and would be back in Texas the next day.

However Edward Russell a reporter with the online travel news site Skift tweeted that an unnamed source within United informed him that Cruz had ""rebooked his flight back to Houston from Cancun for this afternoon at around 6 a.m. today (Thursday). He was originally scheduled to return on Saturday."" Russell acknowledged the leak after another travel industry journalist Thrifty Traveler editor Kyle Potter tweeted a photo showing Cruz's name on the upgrade list for the Feb. 18 afternoon flight from Cancun to Houston.

What Happens Next: United Airlines issued a statement to the online news site Politico saying the leak to Russell was under investigation.

""It's against United's policies to share personal information about our customers and we are investigating this incident"" the statement said adding that no options were ""off the table"" and the leaker could be terminated.

But tracking the leaker could be a daunting task as tens of thousands of United employees have access to customer flight data. And sympathy for the leaker was expressed on Twitter by Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.

""Perspective: whoever the ‘leak' is she/he/they have over 10k @united colleagues & families in TX who are freezing while their US Senator skips town & then tries to lie about it"" Nelson tweeted. ""@tedcruz is not a ‘customer' he's a public servant who has lied too many times. WE'RE ALL THE LEAK.""

The regulatory moves involving Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines came after a United Airlines 777 landed safely at Denver International Airport on Saturday after its right engine failed.

United Airlines said on Sunday it would voluntarily and temporarily remove its 24 active planes of this type from its schedule.

Images posted by police in Broomfield Colorado showed significant plane debris on the ground including an engine cowling scattered outside a home and what appeared to be other parts in a field.

Japan's transport ministry ordered Japan Airlines (JAL) and ANA Holdings to suspend the use of 777s with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines while it considered whether to take additional measures.

The transport ministry said on December 4 2020 that a JAL flight from Naha Airport to Tokyo International Airport returned to the airport because of a malfunction in the left engine about 100 kilometers north of Naha Airport.

That plane is the same age as the 26-year-old United Airlines plane involved in Saturday's incident.

United Airlines is the only U.S. operator using the planes according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The other airlines using them are in Japan and South Korea the U.S. agency said.

""We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday's incident"" the FAA said in a statement. ""Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Japan said ANA operated 19 of the type and JAL operated 13 of them.

Pratt & Whitney owned by Raytheon Technologies Corp was not available immediately for comment.

Boeing said its technical advisers are supporting the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board with its investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMS91cy9ib2VpbmctNzc3LWFpcnBsYW5lcy1mZWRlcmFsLWF2aWF0aW9uLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVpodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzAyLzIxL3VzL2JvZWluZy03NzctYWlycGxhbmVzLWZlZGVyYWwtYXZpYXRpb24tYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines ground dozens of Boeing 777 planes after engine failure over Denver,"CNN Business —

Airlines in the United States South Korea and Japan have grounded dozens of Boeing 777 aircraft after one of the jets suffered engine failure Saturday sending debris crashing down over Denver.

Boeing (BA) on Sunday recommended that airlines stop flying versions of the aircraft that are equipped with Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines while US authorities investigate the Denver incident.

The plane manufacturer said that 69 of the 777 jets that are in service are powered by the engine while 59 such aircraft are in storage.

United Airlines (UAL) Korean Air Asiana Airlines All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines (JAPSY) all use Boeing 777s that feature Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines.

The groundings come after an engine attached to a United-operated 777 plane failed Saturday just minutes after the Honolulu-bound flight took off from Denver International Airport. As United Flight 328 returned to the airport it dropped more engine debris through the roofs of homes and into yards.

An initial examination of the Pratt & Whitney PW4077 engine from that flight showed that two fan blades were fractured according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agency said that the remaining blades exhibited damage “to the tips and leading edges.”

The findings are preliminary but they were still enough to spur some airlines to pull planes that use those types of engines from service. The NTSB said that it will examine the engine airline and photos and videos taken by passengers on board the flight along with the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.

Investigators believe a fan blade in the engine came off and took out another blade a source familiar with the situation told CNN.

Grounded flights

United said Sunday that it would immediately pull 24 planes from flying “out of an abundance of caution.” The company said its move was voluntary and temporary and should disrupt only “a small number of customers.”

Japan’s transportation ministry meanwhile said that it had ordered All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines to ground planes using that series of engines. The ministry said that order applied to 19 Boeing 777s at All Nippon Airways and 13 at Japan Airlines that have Prat & Whitney 4000 engines.

South Korea’s Asiana Airlines which owns nine of the planes said it would stop using them too.

The jets are also used by Korean Air which on Tuesday said it would ground the planes. The airline has six of the jets in service while 10 are in storage.

According to the most recent registry data the only airlines that operate with the affected engines are in the United States Japan and South Korea. United is the only US operator with this type of engine in its fleet.

Ongoing investigation

Both Boeing and Pratt & Whitney have said they are cooperating with the US investigation into the Denver incident.

“We are pleased to hear that United Airlines flight 328 returned safely to Denver” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing technical advisers are supporting the US National Transportation Safety Board with its investigation.”

Pratt & Whitney — a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies (RTN) — said it has sent a team to work with investigators looking into the engine failure.

“Pratt & Whitney is actively coordinating with operators and regulators to support the revised inspection interval” of the 4000 engines that power certain 777s” the company said adding that “any further investigative updates regarding this event will be at the discretion of the NTSB.”

The US Federal Aviation Administration on Sunday also issued an emergency order saying it would be stepping up inspections of 777s that use certain Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines.

“We reviewed all available safety data following [the] incident” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. “Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.”

“We’ve experienced engine failure need to turn. Mayday mayday. United uh 28” the pilot radioed soon after takeoff Saturday from Denver International Airport according to the air traffic control call obtained by the Denver Post.

“United 328 heavy mayday mayday aircraft uh…” the pilot repeated before air traffic control came on and asked him to repeat his urgent call for help.

“United 328 heavy mayday aircraft just experienced engine failure need a turn immediately” the pilot warned soon getting permission to make a left turn ready for the emergency landing.

The call came as his engine was fully engulfed in flames above Colorado as caught on shocking video that quickly went viral online.

Other footage showed debris falling from the sky that was filled with black smoke — with huge chunks of the engine falling on the Denver suburb Broomfield.

“Given the number of people who are at Commons Park on a weekend day we are beyond grateful that no one was injured” the town’s police said a sentiment shared by others online.

“It’s mind-boggling to hear nobody was injured or killed when an airplane broke apart in the sky over a packed neighborhood” one follower replied.

Debris about 15 feet in diameter crushed the bed of Kirby Klements’ truck outside his house with other chunks landing in his garden.

“If it had been 10 feet different it would have landed right on top of the house” he told The Associated Press. “And if anyone had been in the truck they would have been dead.”

Despite the drama the Hawaii-bound plane landed safely at Denver International Airport and no one on board or on the ground was hurt authorities said — much to the amazement of many onboard.

“When it initially happened I thought we were done. I thought we were going down” said Delucia who stuffed his wallet in his pocket so he could be easily identified if the plane did go down.

“The pilot did an amazing job” Delucia said.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the airplane experienced a right-engine failure shortly after takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Authorities have not released any details about what may have caused the failure.

""This will likely mean that some airplanes will be removed from service"" Dickson said in a statement posted to Twitter.

According to the FAA aviation safety experts are meeting into the evening with Pratt & Whitney and Boeing to finalize the details of the order and any accompanying service bulletins in order to ensure that the appropriate airplanes are included. Exact details of the inspection will be specified in the emergency order.

Dickson added that the agency is ""working closely with other civil aviation authorities to make this information available to affected operators in their jurisdictions.”

UNITED FLIGHT'S ENGINE CATCHES FIRE AFTER DENVER TAKEOFF RETURNS TO AIRPORT SAFELY

The move comes in response to United Airlines flight 328 which experienced an engine failure after taking off from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The airplane landed safely after dropping debris over northern Colorado officials said.

The Boeing 777 was heading from Denver to Honolulu with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard when its right engine failed and erupted in flames. The plane quickly lost altitude and dropped huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass onto the neighborhoods below. Authorities said no injuries were reported aboard the plane or on the ground where debris fell.

""We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident"" Dickson said. ""Based on the initial information we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Boeing said in a statement that it is ""actively monitoring recent events related to United Airlines Flight 328"" and that while an investigation into the incident by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway it recommends ""suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines until the FAA identifies the appropriate inspection protocol.""

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a Sunday evening investigation update that an intitial examination indicated that the airplane sustained minor damage most of which was ""confined to the number 2 engine.""

Investigators noted that the inlet a duct which is required to ensure smooth airflow into the engine and a cowling the removable metal covering that houses the engine were separated from the engine. In addition two fan blades were fractured while the remainder of the blades exhibited damage to their tips and leading edges.

The NTSB added that investigators continue to examine the engine airplane and the photographs and video taken by passengers aboard United flight 328 and that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were transported to the agency's laboratory in Washington where each will be downloaded and analyzed.

According to the most recent registry data airlines in only three countries operate airplanes with the affected engines: the United States Japan and South Korea. United Airlines the only U.S. operator with this type of engine in its fleet said it would ground the affected planes immediately.

""Starting immediately and out of an abundance of caution we are voluntarily and temporarily removing 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from our schedule.

“The acquisition in 2016 was made to integrate [Marken’s] know-how on clinical trials and drug development and how we can position the different services around supply chain” said Ariette van Strien president of Marken.

More than a logistics provider Marken is the industry leader in direct to patient (DTP) and direct from patient (DFP) solutions. For example Marken can deliver drugs to the home of a patient participating in a clinical trial. Then through its nursing network collect biological samples from that patient in their home pack the sample and ship it back to the pharmaceutical company conducting the clinical trial.

Unity in a time of crisis

Bolstered by Marken’s extensive capabilities in the field of clinical trials and biological sample shipments UPS Healthcare is a logistics partner of choice for COVID-19 vaccine trials around the world. But Marken had to make rapid adjustments to keep clinical trials going amid country-wide shutdowns.

“At that time direct to patient services was probably 5% of what we were doing” Ariette said. “So we needed to switch the whole company to direct to patient in six seven weeks globally. And it was a huge challenge. We onboarded 120 pharma clients in less than six weeks.”

Today UPS Healthcare is supporting 10 vaccine trials and pursuing another 40. They also support most of the drugs and therapies used to treat and cure COVID-19.

“We added 600 people in 2020” Ariette said. “So every third person is new right now and we continue to grow.”

When vaccines were ready for mass distribution Marken’s expertise and experience with clinical trials helped UPS Healthcare adapt quickly to meet the challenge of handling temperature-sensitive shipments on a scale not seen before.

“That’s what we do every day for everything” said Dan Bell Marken’s vice president Americas Region. “Whether it's frozen blood on dry ice that's coming back from a patient or if it's a biological salient gene or a resource material for therapy that's on liquid nitrogen. We already do that.”

Building more than a reputation

Leveraging Marken’s hybrid services along with UPS’s small package and freight forwarding networks UPS Healthcare has solidified its position as a logistics powerhouse handling all aspects of the supply chain from early clinical trial to commercial distribution of an approved drug.

Nightly below-freezing temperatures gripped cities in northern Mexico particularly those on the border of Texas while the provinces of Quebec and Ontario in Canada have been hit by two powerful snowstorms last week alone. The impact of these events internationally has proven disastrous as power blackouts road and school closures and deaths continue.

A review of the trajectory of Winter Storm Uri as it has unofficially been named by the Weather Channel shows its broad impact. Starting on February 13 a frontal storm off the coast of the Pacific Northwest started to spread southeast at a rapid speed culminating above the Rocky Mountains on the same day. As it moved further south and southeast the storm began to develop more as it reached Oklahoma and Texas all the way to northern Mexico. On February 16 the storm strained northern Mexico’s power grids to such an extent that 4.7 million homes and businesses in Mexico lost power.

While the storm moved rapidly through the southeast United States and into Mexico on February 16 the storm developed another low-pressure center in the north and moved rapidly toward the northeast. The storm quickly broke in half with one half moving northwards through Quebec while the original storm system continued toward the northeast United States.

In Canada the storm passed through Quebec Ontario and finally into Newfoundland. While bus lines closed in Toronto and schools closed temporarily in Halton and Durham the densest snowfall in Ontario was around 30 cm in St. Catherine’s and Hamilton along Lake Ontario. Another snowstorm fueled by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and pushing northwards with the current storm in the United States brought more snow to Ontario this weekend.

Intersecting with the ongoing crisis of the global COVID-19 pandemic the storm’s impact on US transportation infrastructure contributed to delayed shipments of the Pfizer vaccine to Canada by at least one day this week according to CBC News. Pfizer’s vaccine is shipped from its facility in Puurs Belgium to Canada through Louisville Kentucky by air. A significant buildup of snow and ice shut down distribution from United Parcel Service Worldport the corporation’s gigantic shipping hub located at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.

Residents of Mexican towns along the Texas border have been experiencing the similarly dire consequences of their US neighbors. While temperatures have begun to return to normal last week was one of catastrophic conditions in northern Mexico. Over the course of the week temperatures dipped to as low as -18 degrees Celsius (0 degrees Fahrenheit) in the cities of Nuevo León Coahuila Tamaulipas and Chihuahua on the Texas border. Over a dozen people have died. Photos taken in the border town of Ciudad Juarez show people walking through heavy falling snow while others show workers huddled near makeshift fires on the streets to stay warm.

The rolling blackouts in seven northern Mexican states were the outcome of the close economic relationship between Mexico and the US. Due to adverse weather conditions earlier this week Mexico was unable to import a quarter of the four billion cubic feet of natural gas it receives daily from the US. As a result hundreds of thousands of mainly working class residents in northern Mexico had their power shut off. Roughly 60 percent of all electricity in the country is generated through natural gas and as of 2019 96 percent of Mexico’s natural gas imports come from the United States.

As well as impacting homes and small businesses the sharp reduction of natural gas imports into the country has also had an immediate effect on Mexican steel and aluminum plants. According to S&P Global Platts “Mexican steel and aluminum producers were under pressure to reduce natural gas consumption but many of them ended up suspending production as operating with lower gas levels was unsustainable and lossmaking for them.”

The effects of this halt in production could have a number of consequences including the delay of sizeable back orders and new orders of steel and aluminum to be exported abroad. Aluminum product prices in general are expected to rise amid the robust demand from auto makers. Like their brothers and sisters in the US hundreds of workers at these plants could also face speedup to make up for lost production time as well as job and wage cuts as a result of the disruption to the production of profits.

On February 17 Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) announced that to offset this loss of natural gas the country would immediately increase the output of oil and coal to generate electricity. However rolling blackouts across northern Mexico were in effect at least until the end of the weekend. In his statement AMLO made sure to blame the frigid weather in Texas for the shortage of natural gas but declared there would be “no retaliation” on the part of Mexico for the current energy crisis.

Echoing the callousness of his US counterparts in the ruling political establishment AMLO placed the burden of the social disaster squarely on the backs of the working class telling workers and residents Thursday to “help us by consuming less” and “switch off extra light bulbs during the peak evening hours ... to be totally sure that our electricity system is maintained and that we don’t suffer from blackouts.” Touted as a “left-wing” and “progressive” president by the media and pseudo-left groups worldwide AMLO’s true class character is on display once again in his dismissal of the suffering of workers and complete subservience to the interests of the global energy corporations.

Unable to receive the needed energy from US sources the Mexican government has sought to secure gas supplies from Asia. As of Thursday it was reported that two Malaysian-flagged tankers carrying liquefied natural gas were set to arrive in the Mexican ports of Altamira and Manzanillo. According to the Mexican government additional cargoes are expected to reach Mexican ports from Asia in the following days.

On one hand the crisis triggered by Winter Storm Uri showcases the international character of the ruling class’ criminally inadequate response. As all of North America experiences the ravaging effects of the storm on homes and businesses alike the ruling class utilizes the flow of natural gas and other energy sources to fuel the private profits of massive energy corporations.

As the decay of capitalism continues to produce catastrophes of a global character including the exacerbation of naturally occurring storms through man-made climate change the ruling class continues to respond by prioritizing the wealth of a few billionaires over the health and lives of billions of workers.

On the other hand the social crisis brought on by the storm highlights its solution which lies in the mobilization of the world’s resources and the international working class to coordinate the production and distribution of energy to the billions who need it.

In contrast to the profit interests of a handful of wealthy oligarchs the stock markets and the banks the working class united across national boundaries must fight to put an end to the control of energy for private profit and instead put forward a program to fight for public control over the production and distribution of the world’s energy supplies to fulfill social need. The demand must be raised for the major energy companies in every country to be placed under the democratic control of the international working class.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZW5uaW5ndG9uL25hbWUvZG9uYWxkLXZpbmNlbnQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTIzNzkxMznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Vincent Obituary (1948 - 2021) - Ocala VT - Bennington Banner,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bennington/name/donald-vincent-obituary?id=12379139 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZW5uaW5ndG9uL25hbWUvZG9uYWxkLXZpbmNlbnQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTIzNzkxMznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yMS9lbGVjdHJpYy1idXNtYWtlci1hcnJpdmFsLXNjaGVkdWxlcy1maXJzdC11ay1yb2FkLXRyaWFs0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvZmViLzIxL2VsZWN0cmljLWJ1c21ha2VyLWFycml2YWwtc2NoZWR1bGVzLWZpcnN0LXVrLXJvYWQtdHJpYWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric busmaker Arrival schedules first UK road trial,"Electric buses built by Arrival the UK-based manufacturer will be tested on British roads for the first time later this year in a trial with the transport company First Group.

The tests will begin in the autumn of this year starting with four of the first production vehicles produced at Arrival’s research and development facility in Banbury Oxfordshire. Discussions are under way about further trials with other companies.

The trials are the latest step in the rapid expansion of Arrival which has attracted investment worth hundreds of millions of pounds to build battery-powered vans and buses with zero exhaust emissions. The company still yet to start full production hopes that by 2024 it will make revenues of about $3.1bn (£2.2bn) from bus sales along with about $10.9bn from vans.

Arrival is also looking at an undisclosed number of new sites for factories within the UK a signal of its intent to ramp up output as it prepares a reverse listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York at a valuation of $5.4bn (£3.9bn). The company’s main operations will remain in the UK.

Bus companies are hurrying to cut carbon emissions to meet clean air regulations in cities. First Group will not buy diesel buses after 2022 and it plans to eliminate exhaust emissions by 2035.

First Group is also running separate trials of electric buses made by the rival manufacturers BYD ADL Optare and Yutong as well as a trial of hydrogen fuel cell buses in Aberdeen its home city.

Arrival hopes to roll out bus production quickly to target big cities around the world. It aims to produce 1000 buses in 2022 and 11000 in 2024. As well as a facility at Bicester also in Oxfordshire Arrival has started work on a factory in Rock Hill South Carolina.

Arrival which now employs more than 1400 people was founded in secret in 2014 by Denis Sverdlov a Russian telecoms entrepreneur. The company is using “microfactory” facilities that break with the traditional logic of making cars on big production lines instead using robots to assemble vehicles in “cells”.

Arrival’s first publicly announced product an electric van for “last-mile” delivery in cities will begin trials with United Parcel Service a US courier at the end of February. UPS last year ordered 10000 vans in a deal worth €400m (£350m).

Avinash Rugoobur Arrival’s president said built-in tracking information screens and internet connections could allow the buses to connect better with other modes of transport and provide better user experiences. The flat floor also makes accessibility easier.

“We’re really at the start of what’s possible just within the bus platform” Rugoobur said. Buses in use today “definitely do the job but similar to the van market we’re talking about technology that hasn’t moved to where the world is today.”

The electric buses will be priced much like diesel buses although Arrival estimates that the total cost of ownership will be significantly less because of lower fuel and maintenance costs. It has not disclosed the buses’ range but Rugoobur said they should be able to handle most urban routes.

Arrival buys its batteries from Korea’s LG Chem but Rugoobur said the company would be glad to source batteries in the future from a UK-based factory if one could be successfully launched.

The company is also working on driverless operations for controlled situations such as within company depots although Rugoobur cautioned that driverless buses on roads were some way off.

“For driverless buses to be a reality you need true fault-tolerant road-going autonomy” he said. We’re not there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9vdHRhd2EvdS1zLXBvc3Qtb2ZmaWNlLWNhbmFkYS1tYWlsLXBhbmRlbWljLTEuNTkyMDUwMtIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS41OTIwNTAy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You've got mail overflowing U.S. post office near Canadian border tells Ontario customers,"The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) office in Ogdensburg N.Y. says it's no longer able to hold on to an overflowing amount of Canadian mail — and customers north of the border are now scrambling to make alternate arrangements.

The office recently sent an email to its Canadian customers telling them that their PO box locations ""have limited capacity to hold mail including packages for extended periods of time.""

Canadians now have until March 15 to have someone get their mail or it will be classified as ""unclaimed"" and returned to the sender.

Many people in eastern Ontario use postal boxes at the Ogdensburg post office to have items delivered that are usually only available in the United States.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic they would then drive across the border to pick them up.

But since March 2020 the land border between Canada and the United States has been closed for non-essential travel and many people haven't been able to claim their mail.

Border closure 'isn't without a cost'

Ottawa's Karen Parkinson is one of those people.

Parkinson owns a printing business that has customers in the U.S. and she relies on the Ogdensburg post office to send orders which lowers the cost of shipping.

Karen Parkinson who owns a printing business in Ottawa says she's been unable to claim important documents and mail from the Ogdensburg N.Y. post office since the land border closed last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. (Submitted by Karen Parkinson)

She said she has customer payments invoices bank statements legal documents and other time-sensitive mail sitting in her box and there's no one in the U.S. able to pick it up for her.

""The solution is to maybe wait until the beginning of March and see if we can pay the USPS to forward all that mail and whatever else is waiting for us up to here in Ottawa"" Parkinson said.

""We're willing to do whatever it takes to get this pandemic behind us but it isn't without a cost.""

Thousands of packages unclaimed

Laurel Lee Roethel owner of Roethel Parcel Service in Ogdensburg said she's been contacted by dozens of Canadians asking if she can collect their mail from the post office and arrange for delivery.

""I've never seen anything like this. I've been helping Canadians with their packaging since 1984 so I've been around the block a few times. And I've never seen anything like this"" she said.

Roethel said her business is also holding on to a large number of packages for Canadian customers — more than 2000 many since March of last year.

While ""things have been piling up"" Roethel said she doesn't have space issues. She's also been able to arrange for parcels to be forwarded from her office into Canada.

In an email to CBC News a spokesperson for the USPS said customers can be assured ""that there is not a tremendous spill of packages behind the scenes.""

It brings to life a dark and mysterious beast but when mixed with a sci-fi element it adds to the horror and suspense of the story.

This is a story that focuses on escape and survival of the characters within it yet it is the stunning bleak Scottish landscapes and the unpredictability of the story which play the biggest parts.

Drawing influence from the likes of Alien and The Thing as well as Scottish hit Under the Skin the Zoghogg Studios production has been a work in progress for some time.

With test footage being shot originally back in 2017 it has been a long process and when coupled with coronavirus restrictions filming is still some time away.

However David told the Press that he had high hopes for the film which will see a large sci-fi soundstage created in Dunfermline for the picture.

“We are aiming to raise a minimum of £20000” he commented.

“With these additional funds we will be able to complete our amazing set-build at our soundstage in Dunfermline and funds will also help towards travel accommodation transport location fees equipment rentals expenses catering and more.

“We shot the test footage four years ago and it was only last summer that I decided with my cinematographer that we would go with Skinjacker.

“There’s a group of characters living in this remote area and they lose all of the power in the area; they lose power in their cars batteries lights etc.

“With it being a sei-film some of the characters start to go missing and it has that creepy horror vibe to it.

“You realise that something is a little bit different here and the characters start to clash and deal with their differences at the same time as something else is in the area with them.”

The crowdfunder launched on Friday and is available to visit here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But some other market observers are sounding notes of caution over the stock’s ever-increasing influence on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average as technical changes caused by its recent highs raise its already-outsized impact on the blue-chip gauge.

A fivefold increase in Fast Retailing’s tick size — the minimum amount by which the stock can move up or down — and a surge in its weighting in the index mean the Nikkei’s rise is increasingly intertwined with that of the casual clothing firm even as Japanese stocks look to test record bubble-era highs. The Nikkei broke the 30000 barrier this week returning to that level for first time since 1990.

Fast Retailing has risen about 80 percent in the past 12 months and the price per share broke the 100000 yen ($946) level on Tuesday making it the only listed company in Japan to trade at such a value. That triggered a technical change as under Japan Exchange Group Inc. rules the tick size on stocks trading above 100000 yen jumps to 50 yen.

“Each step gets bigger. Up to 99999 yen it only moved 10 yen a tick” said investor Taketsugu Agari. “The Nikkei 225 may become ever-more dominated by moves in Fast Retailing.”

In the last six months alone the apparel maker has contributed more than 1600 points to the Nikkei 225 single-handedly responsible for nearly a quarter of the index’s 31 percent gain in that time. The shares briefly touched a record high Friday morning before ending the day 2.4 percent lower contributing nearly half of the Nikkei’s 0.7 percent drop.

Junichi Hashimoto senior quants analyst at Daiwa Securities Co. says that while the tick size is unlikely to be an issue in the short term it could be a concern over longer periods. “If the price is consistently high when it falls the impact will be greater and the volatility could increase” he said.

That’s further compounded by Fast Retailing’s outsized weighting on the index. The Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted gauge meaning that the arbitrary price of an individual share determines how much of the index a company makes up. At 100000 yen a share Fast Retailing is a giant.

That weighting stood Thursday at a record 12.8 percent higher than the largest weighting on any other developed market benchmark. While Fast Retailing has been the dominant force on the Nikkei 225 for a decade its proportion on the index has surged along with its share price forcing passive investors to buy more of the stock as the Nikkei gains.

The biggest stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average UnitedHealth Group Inc. makes up 6.8% of that price-weighted measure. On Japan’s broader Topix index Fast Retailing is the 41st largest weighting making up just 0.5%.

That has sparked concern among some such as Takashi Ito a senior strategist at Nomura Securities Co. who notes that what goes up could also come down -- fast.

“If long-term investors change their outlook and decide to cut back on their holdings of Fast Retailing then the Nikkei 225 could unravel pretty rapidly” he said.

ADVERTISEMENT

One option to fix this would be a stock split -- the method that drove Apple Inc.’s share of the Dow Jones from around 12 percent to less than 3 perent last year in turn triggering a boost in its share price by making it easier for retail investors to buy in.

But Fast Retailing has long demurred on the idea of splitting its shares. In response to questions from Bloomberg News the company said that it wasn’t considering a stock split directing investors to a periodic statement on the appropriateness of the size of its investment units.

Still others are less concerned about what’s long been known as an issue with price-weighted measures such as the Nikkei. Makoto Sengoku a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute argues that criticism of Fast Retailing for skewing the Nikkei 225 “isn’t anything new.”

“You also have to give credit to Fast Retailing for having reached this share level” he said.

In February 2020 International Community Health Services (ICHS) was the first of the nation’s nearly 1400 federally qualified health centers — serving 30 million people most of them low-income immigrants and refugees — with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.

Our staff have seen the tragic costs of a pandemic that has infected more than 100 million people worldwide and claimed more than 2 million deaths. So when the first doses of the Moderna vaccine rolled through our doors on Dec. 23 we felt ready.

On Jan. 14 the Biden administration unveiled the details of a $1.9 trillion rescue package that includes funding for expanded testing; a national vaccination program in partnership with states localities tribes and territories; and 100000 public health workers to carry out vaccine outreach and contact tracing.

This boost from the federal government and commitment to community partnerships is a step in the right direction to beat this current pandemic but it’s still just a band aid.

If we are to ensure that our children and grandchildren are prepared to withstand the pandemics of the future we need public health funding to be the norm not just in the middle of a global crisis. There are glaring long-standing problems that were highlighted with the COVID-19 pandemic that we can finally learn from and address.

Three major national vulnerabilities in particular aided and abetted the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. in 2020. Unless addressed these vulnerabilities will obstruct our ability to effectively deliver the vaccine as well as our response to future pandemics.

1. Limited authority of public health policymakers

Trust in public health experts is critical to controlling pandemics because human behavior either helps spread or stop them. Public health policies tell the people in our communities what they need to know and what they need to do. People need to trust these policies are guided solely by the available knowledge and evidence not politics. The politicization of the pandemic response in the U.S. eroded effective preventive messaging and stoked public skepticism of public health guidance. In New Zealand and Iceland where public health officials were empowered to direct the pandemic response cases and deaths were virtually nil.

2. Underfunded and uncoordinated public health infrastructure

Effective public health measures lead to healthy people who are less susceptible to severe cases of infection during a pandemic. And yet we’ve seen funding cuts to public health at all levels. The Affordable Care Act’s Prevention and Public Health Fund was whittled from $15 billion to less than $3 billion over 10 years. Here in Washington State our public health budget declined from $65 to $53 per capita between 1998 and 2014. The proposed Washington State budget for 2021 reduces public health spending by $4.6 million. The COVID-19-related economic downturn has created additional public health budgetary constraints. When the next pandemic hits a lack of public health funding leaves us all at risk and positioned to fall short of the staff and tools needed for the mass deployment of the vaccine.

3. Inadequate and maldistributed primary health care networks

In addition to a well-funded and empowered public health infrastructure strengthening primary care is key to responding early and effectively to a pandemic. Less than 8% of U.S. health care spending goes toward primary care services. Only 75% of the U.S. population has a primary care provider. Community health centers alone provide care to 29 million people in both rural and urban centers across the United States. Primary care centers are key partners in identifying outbreaks screening and testing and vaccinating the population in addition to managing chronic illnesses that could mitigate risk of severe infection. Yet primary care remains underfunded. Reimbursement for primary care services lags behind hospital and procedure-based services.

When a pandemic occurs our greatest asset is a rapidly deployable public health and primary care workforce. We have the means to quickly develop diagnostic tests treatments and vaccines. But they are as helpful as an unarmed weapons system without a functional network of primary care infrastructure to collaborate with public health to screen quarantine and vaccinate those most at risk.

It’s time for a meaningful shift to investments in universal health care and for our lawmakers to fully fund and strengthen our public health infrastructure. Without it we are left with the continued threat of losing a million or more lives from an entirely preventable infection.

The Department of Defense's inspector general announced Friday it will review the Trump administration's decision to relocate U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs Colorado to Huntsville Alabama. Why it matters: The inspector general will investigate whether the decision — announced a week before Trump left office — complied with Air Force and Pentagon policy.

Between the lines: At a campaign rally in Colorado Springs in 2020 Trump signaled the command would remain at Peterson Air Force Base AP reports.

Trump held the rally with then Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) who lost his 2020 reelection bid and Colorado unlike Alabama voted against Trump in November.

Multiple states including Florida and Texas waged lobbying campaigns with the Trump administration to host the site of the new headquarters.

Abstract

Development assistance for health programmes is often characterised as donor-led models with minimal country ownership and limited sustainability. This article presents new ways for low-income and middle-income countries to gain more control of their development assistance programming as they move towards universal health coverage (UHC). We base our findings on the experience of the African Collaborative for Health Financing Solutions (ACS) an innovative US Agency for International Development-funded project. The ACS project stems from the premise that the global health community can more effectively support UHC processes in countries if development partners change three long-standing paradigms: (1) time-limited projects to enhancing long-lasting processes (2) fly-in/fly-out development support to leveraging and strengthening local and regional expertise and (3) static knowledge creation to supporting practical and co-developed resources that enhance learning and capture implementation experience. We assume that development partners can facilitate progress towards UHC if interventions follow five action steps including (1) align to country demand (2) provide evidence-based and tailored health financing technical support (3) respond to knowledge and learnings throughout activity design and implementation (4) foster multi-stakeholder collaboration and ownership and (5) strengthen accountability mechanisms.

Así lo destacó Carlos Fernando Mayorga gerente general de la Federación Nacional de Productores de Panela (Fedepanela). Según el directivo las ventas externas han venido aumentando poco a poco y el año pasado llegaron a más de 12.000 toneladas.

“Estamos haciendo todo el trabajo para fortalecer el tema de las exportaciones para que este año podamos llegar a 15.000 toneladas exportadas y seguir con la estrategia para que se incluya la panela en los mercados municipales” dijo Mayorga.

Al igual el gerente de Fedepanela también destacó que en 2015 se exportaba 3.000 toneladas y ahora ya se llega a 12.000 toneladas. “Eso es el resultado de un trabajo articulado que ha requerido de bastante esfuerzo” dijo. Es decir que en los últimos cinco años las toneladas exportadas de panela han tenido un crecimiento de 300%.

Entre los principales destinos de las ventas externas de este producto se encuentra Estados Unidos España Italia Chile y Panamá. “El crecimiento de las exportaciones de panela durante 2020 confirma que el mundo busca productos de calidad y con propiedades nutricionales especialmente en Estados Unidos y Europa” dijo Flavia Santoro presidenta de ProColombia.

En cuanto a los precios de la panela Mayorga señaló que estos se han recuperado en las últimas semanas gracias a que se ha venido recuperando su consumo en medio de la pandemia. El dirigente gremial destacó la creación de los mercados solidarios que incluyeron la panela lo cual ayudó en esa recuperación de precios.

“A comienzos del año pasado teníamos un inventario de caña menor en el país y esto unido a la situación de la cuarentena por el covid-19 disparó la demanda lo que hizo que el precio reaccionara positivamente” aclaró Mayorga.

El directivo además resaltó que esperan que este año los precios de la panela se mantengan de manera positiva por lo menos por encima de los costos de producción. “El año pasado el precio promedio nacional de panelas corrientes en los mercados municipales (es decir el que se le paga al productor) era de $2.635 frente a unos costo de producción de alrededor de $2.350 sin tener en cuenta los comerciales. Antes veníamos de unos precios de casi $1.800 o $1.700 promedio cuando los costos de producción estaban en alrededor de los $2.200 y $2.350” resaltó.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbm9ydGVkZWNhc3RpbGxhLmVzL2Nhc3RpbGxheWxlb24vcGFuZGVtaWEtbGFzdHJhLXZlbnRhcy0yMDIxMDIyMDE3NDUyNy1udC5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxub3J0ZWRlY2FzdGlsbGEuZXMvY2FzdGlsbGF5bGVvbi9wYW5kZW1pYS1sYXN0cmEtdmVudGFzLTIwMjEwMjIwMTc0NTI3LW50X2FtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coronavirus: La pandemia lastra las ventas de las Loterías del Estado con una caída del 169% en Castilla y León,"La pandemia de la covid-19 lastró las ventas de los juegos de Loterías y Apuestas del Estado en Castilla y León durante 2020 con una caída del 169 por ciento con respecto al año anterior. El cierre de las administraciones y la suspensión de todos los sorteos durante nueve semanas entre la 12 (16 de marzo) y la 20 (17 de mayo) provocaron que la recaudación de los juegos de la empresa pública estatal se quedara en 5661 millones de euros frente a los 6814 millones de 2019. Es decir 1153 millones menos en un solo ejercicio.

Al igual que en todos los sectores el año 2020 marcó un punto de inflexión y truncó la buena evolución de la recaudación de la empresa estatal de Loterías en Castilla y León. En concreto se rompe un incremento constante y continuado desde 2015.

El descenso del 169 por ciento en las ventas de los juegos de Loterías y Apuestas en la comunidad es idéntico al experimentado en el conjunto de España donde los 9.256 millones de 2019 contrastan con los 7.687 millones del ejercicio pasado. Todas las comunidades sufrieron caídas en las ventas de sus juegos aunque oscilaron entre las bajadas del 151 por ciento de Extremadura y Castilla-La Mancha y el 216 por ciento de Baleares o el 198 por ciento de Canarias.

Pese a las malas cifras fuentes del sector de la comunidad consultadas por la Agencia Ical consideraron que se ha logrado «salvar» un año que estuvo marcado por la pandemia de la covid con un descenso generalizado del consumo de las familias por el estado de alarma decretado en marzo el confinamiento las restricciones a la movilidad y el teletrabajo durante varios meses.

Hasta el punto que hablan de una caída «contenida». No en vano recordaron que los juegos no son un producto de primera necesidad y pocos loteros pensaban en marzo con el cese de toda la actividad que la caída iba rondar el 17 por ciento. Como ejemplo citaron que el descenso de las matriculaciones de vehículos nuevos fue del 25 por ciento en Castilla y León.

También declararon que un ejercicio malo como 2013 en el que no hubo pandemia ni nada especialmente reseñable la recaudación de Loterías por las ventas llegaron a descender el siete por ciento. Por lo tanto una caída del 169 por ciento en un año para olvidar tampoco es un «descalabro». «Recuperar nueve semanas de cierre de las administraciones y una suspensión total de la actividad es una misión imposible» precisaron a Ical.

Las administraciones subrayaron el «tirón» de última hora con la Lotería de Navidad con unas ventas en Castilla y León de 2035 millones de euros. Una cifra importante pero que supuso un 117 por ciento menos en 2019 motivado en parte por el cierre de establecimientos de hostelería y comercios que siempre han vendido décimos y participaciones.

En todo caso el sorteo especial de final de año significó el 36 por ciento del total de la recaudación de la empresa pública. Es decir el Gordo mueve más de uno de cada tres euros del conjunto de los juegos de la compañía en la Comunidad unos datos que se mantienen a lo largo de los años.

El descenso experimentado en Castilla y León por las ventas de la Lotería de Navidad es muy similar al de España donde bajó un 111 por ciento pese a que la Agrupación Nacional de Asociaciones Provinciales de Administradores de Lotería (Anapal) auguraba a finales de octubre un descalabro con un desplome del 30 por ciento.

Una caída del 11 por ciento que la empresa dio por buena tal y como aseguró el presidente de Loterías y Apuestas del Estado Jesús Huerta el mismo día del sorteo cuando reconoció que la cifra no le satisfacía pero era «digna». «Loterías se ha resentido en todos los niveles. Se vende menos y habrá mucho menos margen de beneficio además se ha resentido a nivel de puntos de venta» indicó. En este sentido se refirió al impacto de la pandemia a la hora de repartir participaciones para el sorteo en canales tradicionales como asociaciones clubes equipos deportivos y empresas.

Según los datos a los que ha tenido acceso Ical la recaudación de 5661 millones de euros se reparte entre los juegos pasivos (Lotería Nacional Lotería del Jueves y Lotería del Sábado) y los activos (Primitiva Euromillones Bonoloto y Quiniela en los que el usuario apuesta con el pronóstico y elige los números).

Se rompe la tendencia positiva

El año de la pandemia marcará como en todos los sectores un antes y un después en la historia de Loterías y Apuestas del Estado. La recaudación del organismo estatal en la Comunidad cayó un 102 por ciento entre 2008 y 2013 al pasar de 7036 a 6317 millones de euros. Es decir casi 72 millones menos en cinco años. El mayor retroceso se produjo precisamente en 2013 cuando las ventas cayeron un 67 por ciento. Esa tendencia negativa cambió en 2015 ya que la recaudación aumentó un 38 por ciento hasta los 6472 millones. Desde entonces el crecimiento había sido sostenido con 6476 millones en 2016; 6578 en 2017; 6659 en 2018 y 6814 millones de euros en 2019.

La tendencia observada en los últimos ejercicios por las administraciones de loterías es que cada vez hay más apostantes pero con menos importe lo cual compensa «un poco» las ventas. Una ecuación que es palpable cuando existe un bote acumulado con mucho dinero. «El ciudadano que habitualmente no juega se siente atraído por las grandes cantidades y decide probar suerte sin analizar el cálculo de probabilidades» añadieron.

El cierre de los bares durante varios meses de 2020 provocó que muchos de sus clientes acudieran a una administración para adquirir el décimo de la Lotería Nacional que habitualmente compraba en el local de hostelería. Durante este tiempo los loteros también han podido palpar el ánimo de los ciudadanos por que las administraciones son un buen «termómetro» de la situación por la que atraviesa un país. «Ante tantas desgracias con contagios y muertos mucha gente ha buscado un aliciente con los sorteos» apuntaron.

El miedo de los clientes a acudir a la ventanilla a comprar su décimo o realizar su apuesta está detrás que la recaudación del canal de internet de la compañía aumentara en 2020 un 32 por ciento y 64 millones más hasta un total de 197.8 millones de euros.

De momento las ventas de otro sorteo importante como la Lotería del Niño del 6 de enero pasado han tenido un buen comportamiento con un descenso de solo el uno por ciento en comparación con el año 2020 en que todavía no había coronavirus. Eso sí el sector advirtió que la situación se puede complicar a lo largo del año cuando finalicen los ERTEs aumente el paro y se resienta la economía española.

Provincias

La recaudación del conjunto de juegos de Loterías como era de esperar cayó en todas las provincias aunque hay diferencias de hasta cuatro puntos entre unos territorios y otros. Burgos registró la mayor bajada con un 188 por ciento de caída con respecto al año anterior hasta los 978 millones de euros seguida de Segovia con un 186 por ciento menos hasta los 406 millones. Estuvieron dos puntos por encima de la media autonómica y lejos de una de las provincias que siempre juega a la Lotería como es Soria donde el descenso fue del 145 por ciento hasta situarse en los 347 millones. También estuvo en esos porcentajes Valladolid con una bajada del 146 por ciento (1064 millones).

En números similares al conjunto de la comunidad estuvieron Ávila con un descenso de las ventas del 171 por ciento (359 millones); Palencia un 172 por ciento (438 millones). Por su parte León estuvo un poco por debajo de la media autonómica al registrar una bajada del 166 por ciento (1029 millones) mientras que la recaudación en Salamanca y Zamora (que dependen de una misma delegación) cayó un 175 por ciento hasta los 1037 millones de euros.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZXMubW90b3IxLmNvbS9uZXdzLzQ4ODg3MS9hc2NhcmktZWNvc3NlLTE5OTctYm13LXZlbnRhLXBhaXNlcy1iYWpvcy_SAVBodHRwczovL2VzLm1vdG9yMS5jb20vbmV3cy80ODg4NzEvYXNjYXJpLWVjb3NzZS0xOTk3LWJtdy12ZW50YS1wYWlzZXMtYmFqb3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Este rarísimo Ascari Ecosse de 1997 está a la venta en Países Bajos,"Seguro que has oído hablar del Ascari Race Resort un genial y exclusivo circuito de velocidad situado en las inmediaciones de la localidad de Ronda en Málaga. Y es muy posible también que recuerdes que su fundador Klaas Zwart también lanzó una marca de automóviles homónima.

El fabricante Ascari Cars nació en Inglaterra en 1995 y su nombre hace homenaje al primer piloto que ganó dos veces el Campeonato del Mundo de Pilotos de la Fórmula 1 el italiano Alberto Ascari (1918-1955) que compitió para los equipos oficiales de Scuderia Ferrari Lancia y Maserati.

Este fabricante de automóviles no duró mucho pero durante sus años de existencia lanzó hasta cuatro modelos: el Ascari Ecosse el Ascari KZ1 su variante deportiva o KZ1R y el A10.

Hoy os traemos un ejemplar del primero de todos el rarísimo y exclusivo Ascari Ecosse en concreto una unidad que data de 1997 y que está ahora a la venta en Países Bajos. En principio debía haberse subastado en la cita de RM Sotheby's en París a principios de mes pero sigue disponible.

De aquel coche un pequeño deportivo biplaza de dos puertas y motor central solo se fabricaron 18 unidades y se comercializó durante unos pocos años. Este es uno de los primeros ejemplares producidos y cabe apuntar que lo hizo Lee Noble (el artífice de los automóviles británicos Noble) para Ascari.

El ejemplar en cuestión está a la venta en la ciudad de Tilburg al sur de los Países Bajos aunque según el propio anuncio el coche ha pasado casi década y media en el sur de España suponemos que en el garaje del propio circuito de Ascari ya que perteneció a la familia Zwart hasta 2019 fecha en la que fue adquirido por su actual propietario.

El modelo esconde un motor 44 litros V8 de origen BMW y preparado por el especialista Hartge que ofrece una potencia de alrededor de 300 CV. Gracias a un peso de apenas 1.250 kilogramos el deportivo despacha el 0 a 100 km/h en poco más de 40 segundos. Además este ejemplar equipa una caja de cambios manual de seis marchas en lugar de la original de cinco.

Si algunos detalles del interior te resultan familiares es porque los mandos de la climatización los heredó directamente del Ford Escort de mediados de los 90 mientras que los tiradores de las puertas o los mandos de los retrovisores eléctricos provienen de modelos Ford anteriores. ¿El precio? Su dueño pide nada menos que 165.000 dólares.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsc29sZGVtZXhpY28uY29tLm14L3JlcHVibGljYS9hbC1hbHphLXZlbnRhLWRlLWdhcy1scC1lbi1jaGlodWFodWEtNjM4OTUxNi5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxzb2xkZW1leGljby5jb20ubXgvcmVwdWJsaWNhL2FsLWFsemEtdmVudGEtZGUtZ2FzLWxwLWVuLWNoaWh1YWh1YS02Mzg5NTE2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Al alza venta de gas LP en Chihuahua,"CHIHUAHUA. Las ventas del gas licuado de petróleo (LP) aumentaron 80 por ciento en la última semana en la capital de Chihuahua derivado de las bajas temperaturas y por la escasez del combustible natural.

Sin embargo el gas LP también tuvo un aumento de más de dos pesos por litro al pasar de 11.79 a 13.99 pesos en algunas distribuidoras lo que tomó por sorpresa a los chihuahuenses.

Despachadores de diferentes gaseras dieron a conocer que la venta del gas logró un incremento drástico en comparación de otros meses.

Alejandro García despachador de la estación Z Gas comentó que esta semana las ventas subieron 80 por ciento.

Pedro Olivas de la estación Super Gas dijo que el incremento en el precio no frenó la comercialización de ese producto y que también tuvieron 80 por ciento de aumento en ventas.

Mientras que Víctor Sánchez despachador y encargado de Gas Económico comentó que el precio del gas no ha tenido ningún incremento y mantiene su precio en 11.79 pesos.

La escasez y el aumento en el cobro de gas natural también provocó que se elevaran 700 por ciento las ventas de conexiones para suministro de energético LP en viviendas de la ciudad.

De acuerdo con empleados de ferreterías la venta de tuberías y conexiones para instalar suministros de gas pasó de una a dos por semana a de tres por día.

Ferreteros indicaron que se debe a que los usuarios de la ciudad de Chihuahua comenzaron a remplazar sus conexiones de gas natural por gas LP desde enero ante ligeros aumentos en sus recibos de pago por parte de la empresa EcoGas.

Por su parte Antonio Valadez presidente de la Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Canacintra) dijo que ayer finalizó la restricción en el consumo del servicio de gas natural por parte de la empresa EcoGas. Con información de Antonio Garfio"

SALISBURY — Denise Hallett who leads the Rowan Economic Development Commission as chair of the board also volunteered to serve as a member of the Campaign Committee for the Forward Rowan initiative.

The Forward Rowan initiative seeks to spur economic growth in the county by using a public-private partnership between the Rowan EDC and local businesses.

“I’m proud to be part of the team that has crafted the Forward Rowan plan” Hallett said. “Once implemented this plan will bring greater prosperity reduced poverty and enhance our quality of life here in Rowan County.”

Hallett currently serves as Manager of Government and Community Relations for Vulcan Materials Company a producer of crushed stone for the construction industry. Hallett oversees Vulcan’s government and business relations for their North Carolina operations and is responsible for external public affairs in support of the company’s business development community and governmental relations objectives.

Hallett said in a news release that she is particularly excited about the first strategy in the plan for targeted economic growth and its three key objectives.

“The first key objective is to grow existing businesses” Hallett said. “The EDC’s Expand Rowan program focuses on retaining and expanding local industries which last year assisted in creating nearly 300 jobs from our Rowan County businesses.”

“The second key objective is to attract new firms and investments to Rowan County” Hallett said. “We’ve identified four business sectors that are an excellent fit for Rowan County and its workforce. Those include companies in advanced manufacturing logistics and distribution office and technology and health industries. Our recent successes with Chewy Snow Joe and Eastern Fence demonstrate the desirability of Rowan County and with an increased effort we can bring even more jobs and investment to our area.”

Hallett explained that the third key objective is to grow and promote Rowan’s competitive advantages that attract business investment to Rowan County.

“The Rowan EDC has developed great relationships with our local and state governments and works closely with them to make sure our infrastructure and amenities are enhanced to support business expansion and development” Hallett said.

Hallett called on other businesses to join the Forward Rowan campaign for economic development which is now supported by nearly 40 local companies including Hallett’s Vulcan Materials.

“As chair of the Rowan EDC I ask you to consider investing in Forward Rowan” Hallett said. “My company has and I hope yours will too. Let’s move Rowan forward together.”

Wallace Site in Landis earns certification that could help economic development

LANDIS — The Wallace Site located at 1001 S. Main St. in Landis was recently designated as a certified site in the prestigious ElectriCities Smart Sites Program.

The Smart Sites program also known as S2 was created by ElectriCities to assist member communities such as Landis in preparing shovel-ready sites for economic development.

“It is rare for companies to select an undeveloped unimproved property on which to locate or expand their business” Rowan EDC Vice President Scott Shelton said in a news release. “Time is of the essence for these companies and if they cannot find an existing building to suit their needs they strongly prefer shovel-ready sites with a substantial amount of due diligence already completed. The Smart Site designation will be extremely valuable in helping the Rowan EDC bring more jobs and investment to the Town of Landis.”

As part of the S2 program extensive due diligence was completed on the nearly 26-acre site including a Phase I Environmental Assessment Wetlands Identification and Delineation Subsurface Exploration and Historical / Archeological Studies.

In addition conceptual drawings were prepared to demonstrate the development potential of the site. ElectriCities will also help to market the Wallace Site domestically and internationally at numerous trade shows and industry events

Triangle region named U.S. bid candidate city for 2027 University Games

The United States International University Sports Federation (USIUSF) the United States member organization of the International University Sports Federation (FISU) recently announced that the USIUSF has notified FISU of its intent to host the 2027 Summer World University Games in North Carolina’s Raleigh-Durham market.

The World University Games are the world’s largest event for student athletes. The games are held every other year in the odd year with both winter and summer games in the same year.

The games have 15 required sports including Olympic staples such as athletics (track & field) basketball diving gymnastics swimming and volleyball. The host city for the games can propose additional sports for inclusion in the Games. The Summer World University Games take place over an approximately two-week period during the summer months.

“We have been delighted with both the interest that the Raleigh-Durham market has shown in hosting the Summer World University Games and the significant assets and experience the North Carolina Bid Committee brings to the table” Delise O’Meally secretary general of the USIUSF and a member of the FISU Executive Committee said in a news release. “The fast-growing Triangle region with its 10 colleges and universities deep array of top-quality sports venues and great track record of major multi-sport Olympic events is a natural for hosting the Summer World University Games.”

The bid process for the 2027 Summer World University Games is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into spring 2022 when it is currently projected that FISU will announce the 2027 host city. Bid milestones during the year are expected to include development and submission of a detailed formal bid document conducting an extensive site visit for USIUSF and FISU officials a FISU bid workshop a presentation to the FISU Executive Committee and meetings with FISU and Local Organizing Committee executives at the 2021 summer and winter games in Chengdu and Lucerne respectively.

The credit union’s board of directors has initiated a nationwide search with the help of Russell Reynolds Associates – a search firm with experience in the credit union industry – as part of the board’s long-term CEO succession plan.

Lord joined SECU in 1975 holding many leadership roles and helping the organization navigate numerous changes impacting the credit union and financial services industries. Prior to being named president and CEO in 2016 Lord served as chief financial officer for over 30 years.

“Mike has been an integral part of the SECU leadership and family for nearly five decades. He has shared a wealth of knowledge and made many contributions over his tenure which have helped us anticipate and better meet the needs of our members. We are extremely grateful to Mike for his leadership and commitment particularly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and wish him the best in his much-deserved retirement” SECU Chairman Bob Brinson said in a news release. “The board of directors’ CEO succession plan has us well positioned to find the right candidate who will understand and value the SECU culture of member-service and smoothly guide us through this transition and into the future. We look forward to the next chapter in the long history of SECU growth and success.”

The credit union expects to have the new CEO in place at the time of Lord’s retirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Williams designed some of Las Vegas most distinctive buildings | Local Las Vegas | Local,"Paul R. Williams may not be a household name but many of the homes churches and other buildings he designed stand as testament to his impact in Las Vegas.

He designed affordable bungalows for first-time homeowners and luxurious mansions for Southern California’s elite though as a Black man he wouldn’t have been allowed to live in some of the neighborhoods where those mansions were built.

Architect Paul Revere Williams also designed some notable Las Vegas buildings and contributed to the valley’s historical landscape by creating homes for middle-class Black residents in the Historic Westside and Black workers in Henderson.

Now 41 years after his death Williams may not be a household name but many of the homes churches and other buildings he designed stand as testament to his impact here and in Southern California.

“He was a trailblazer in the architecture community” said Dave Cornoyer who has researched and written about Williams’ work in Las Vegas. He created “a very diverse collection of buildings and really thoughtful plans that are far ahead of (his) time.”

Early adversity

Williams was born in Los Angeles in 1894 and lost both of his parents to tuberculosis by the time he was 4 said Leslie Luebbers project director of The Paul R. Williams Project (paulrwilliamsproject.org) a collaboration of the University of Memphis the Memphis chapter of the American Institute of Architects and the National Organization of Minority Architects.

He was taken in by a woman who was “variously called his foster mother or adoptive mother. It’s not clear what the relationship was” Luebbers said. “But they were very devoted to his education.”

He was the only Black student in his elementary school Luebbers said. In an essay “I Am a Negro” published in American Magazine in 1937 Williams wrote that as a child he “played with white children without being conscious of the stigma attached to color.

“Nothing prepared me for the shock of the discovery that someday those children who then accepted me as one of themselves would learn to treat me with a strange admixture of patronage and contempt intolerance and condescension. There was nothing to warn me that coveted opportunities would be denied me because my face was black.”

Designing a career

Williams recalled that even as a child he had “an instinctive interest in the design of buildings” and decided to become an architect while in high school. But when he told his teacher of his plans “he stared at me with as much astonishment as he would have displayed had I proposed a rocket flight to Mars. ‘Who ever heard of a Negro being an architect?’ he demanded.”

Williams worked his way through university and got a job as a draftsman. Along the way he “won several national awards for design that brought him to the attention of people” Luebbers said. “So he sort of interned but he was basically so good he actually got paid to work for a number of very high-profile architecture and engineering (firms).”

By his early 20s Williams had opened his own firm cultivating a mostly Southern California-based practice designing small efficient homes for average people mansions for Hollywood stars churches and public buildings and became “enormously successful” Luebbers said.

He was a wealthy man. His power within the (Southern California) Black community was very strong and he did a lot of pro bono buildings for the community. He was very generous and contributed to Black causes. Leslie Luebbers project director of The Paul R. Williams Project

“He was a wealthy man. His power within the (Southern California) Black community was very strong and he did a lot of pro bono buildings for the community. He was very generous and contributed to Black causes.”

Yet Williams wrote that he also “encountered many discouragements and rebuffs most of which were predicated upon my color.”

When potential clients who didn’t know that he was Black walked into his office most “were obviously serious in their intention to build. Yet in the moment that they met me and discovered they were dealing with a Negro I could see many of them ‘freeze.’ Their interest in discussing plans waned instantly and their one remaining concern was to discover a convenient exit without hurting my feelings.”

“Virtually everything pertaining to my professional life during those early years was influenced by my need to offset racial prejudice” Williams wrote while the “weight of my racial handicap forced me willy-nilly to develop salesmanship.”

For example Williams learned to draw upside-down so that a prospective client sitting across the desk could see his home appear on paper before his eyes becoming Williams explained “a full partner in the birth of that room.”

The tactic also addressed white clients’ reluctance to sit next to him. “Obviously Mr. Williams was very adaptable and had to be because of the way society was at the time” Cornoyer said.

Coming to Las Vegas

During World War II Williams was hired to design temporary housing for African American workers at Basic Magnesium Inc. in what would become Henderson. Williams designed 498 units and a dormitory in a development called Carver Park Cornoyer said.

Carver Park “really starts the city of Henderson” said Claytee D. White director of the Oral History Research Center at UNLV Libraries. “It was one of the main reasons Blacks migrated there during that era a lot of them from Fordyce Arkansas and Tallulah Louisiana.”

Williams’ next housing development here was Berkley Square in Las Vegas’ Historic Westside which opened in 1955. Laws then “restricted where African Americans could buy homes” Cornoyer said. “Berkley Square was the first (development) where African Americans could buy a new house.”

Berkley Square’s opening coincided with the opening of the Moulin Rouge Las Vegas’ only integrated resort White noted. “So we have a lot of (African American) people coming to the city. The vibrancy of the Black community is really evident at this time. They’re hiring dancers to dance at the Moulin Rouge. They’re hiring people to be chefs and waiters and dealers. And at the same time we have housing being constructed where these people can live.”

Berkley Square was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Ruth Eppenger-Dhondt grew up there and now lives in the home next door to her family home which her parents bought in 1957. She remembers Berkley Square then as a community mostly of working families. “Families knew each other there. It was very social.”

Williams’ original floor plans included a back yard and a carport. Eppenger-Dhondt said most of Berkley Square’s homes have been altered over the years but Williams seems to have designed them with middle-class homeowners in mind.

“I think his talent gave him insight into what was needed” she said.

A Vegas portfolio

Williams continued designing for Las Vegas through the 1960s in projects that demonstrated an amazing versatility. Las Vegas Park a horse racing track on Paradise Road in the vicinity of the Westgate and Las Vegas Country Club for which Williams designed the Jockey Club opened in 1953 but didn’t last. He designed the SkyLift Magi-Cab a never-realized monorail for the Strip in 1966. And he designed the Royal Nevada Hotel on the Strip which opened in 1955 but became part of the Stardust in 1959.

One of his most striking Las Vegas buildings was the La Concha Motel which opened in 1961. Situated on the Strip across from Circus Circus the motel’s futuristic lobby was used for more than 40 years and now serves as the visitor center for The Neon Museum.

Architect’s La Concha Motel lobby becomes Neon Museum fixture When the former La Concha Motel lobby was repurposed as The Neon Museum’s visitor center Dawn Merritt didn’t need customer surveys to tell whether visitors liked it. The only metric needed was seeing how many guests would trip while walking up the building’s steps because they were too busy staring at it or photographing it as they entered. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the La Concha Motel which opened in 1961 on the Strip. Designed by Black architect Paul Revere Williams the motel’s lobby building was moved in 2006 to the Neon Museum where it now serves as a sign itself. “We don’t have a sign … that says ‘Neon Museum’ ” said Merritt the museum’s vice president and chief marketing officer. “That building s our biggest sign. “It reminds me of ‘The Jetsons.’ I love it because it’s also nostalgic.” Effective too. “Once we did have someone who wanted to check in” she said. “We had to explain we’re not a hotel.” The Neon Museum’s collection includes several signs that celebrate Las Vegas’ African-American history. According to the museum — and with historical information from the late Dorothy Wright a long-time museum board member and early architect of the museum — the collection includes these signs: The Moulin Rouge: Las Vegas’ first integrated resort and the location of a March 1960 meeting of community leaders that helped to lead to the end of segregation in Las Vegas hotels and casinos. In addition Sarann Knight-Preddy the first Black woman in Nevada to receive a gaming license owned the Moulin Rouge for several years. (The Moulin Rouge sign last year was reassembled and re-illuminated and now is in the museum’s Neon Boneyard.) The Silver Slipper: The site of a 1950s local NAACP program for Black History Month during a time when according to the museum it was almost impossible to rent a room for a Black event in a Strip or downtown casino. (There are two signs one near the La Concha visitor center and another in the Neon Boneyard.) Fitzgeralds Hotel and Casino: Owned by Don Barden one of just a few African-American casino owners in the country.

The La Concha demonstrates that Williams “wasn’t averse to any kind of architecture” said Mark Hall-Patton Clark County museums administrator. “He wasn’t tied down to a style he wasn’t tied down to an era he wasn’t tied down to anything.”

The Williams-designed Guardian Angel Cathedral — originally called St. Viator Guardian Angel Shrine — opened on the Strip in 1963. The modernistic A-frame design is a departure from the more traditional church buildings he designed in California and the church is still in use after being renovated in 1995.

Unwelcome welcome

According to Luebbers Williams found that Las Vegas “wasn’t as friendly” as Southern California or cities back East where he also did business.

Las Vegas “was populated later than Los Angeles and a lot of people who came there were from the South” she said. “So when he was in Las Vegas or Reno there was no place he could stay. He couldn’t stay in a hotel he couldn’t eat in a restaurant.”

The 1937 magazine essay is “the only thing he ever wrote that sounds a little angry but very eloquent” Luebbers said. “He never did that again because there was a lot of backlash — strangely mostly among Black readers.”

Legacy

Williams designed thousands of homes and commercial buildings before his death in 1980 at age 85. He is considered the first African American member of the American Institute of Architects Cornoyer said and in 2017 was awarded the AIA’s Gold Medal.

Defining Williams’ legacy in Las Vegas is difficult because his work here was “so diverse” Cornoyer said. But Williams’ significance here rippled beyond the structures he created said Esther Langston an emeritus professor at UNLV who lived in Berkley Square from 1963 to 1968.

Berkley Square “became a family where we all knew each other we all helped each other we socialized together. Our kids grew up there” she said.

“What (Williams) really developed in Las Vegas was a sense of community and family. He was building a community.”

Timeline

Paul Revere Williams’ work in Southern Nevada took place from the early ’40s through the ’60s. said Dave Cornoyer who has researched the architect’s work in Las Vegas.

Early 1940s: Carver Park designed as temporary housing for Black workers at Basic Magnesium Inc. in what would later become Henderson. The development located at Lake Mead Drive had 498 one- two- and three-bedroom units and a large dormitory Cornoyer said. In 1974 all but one building was demolished. 1953: Las Vegas Park a horse racing track opens on Paradise Road. Williams designed the track’s Jockey Club. Horse racing never caught on here  Cornoyer notes and the land was sold eventually becoming the site of Las Vegas Country Club and what is now the Westgate. 1955: Berkley Square in Las Vegas’ Historic Westside opens. According to Cornoyer Planning began in 1947 for the 148-home community eventually named after primary project financier Thomas Berkley an Oakland businessman attorney and civil rights advocate. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. 1955: The Royal Nevada Hotel opens on the Strip adjacent to the Stardust. According to Cornoyer It soon fell into bankruptcy and in 1959 was absorbed into the Stardust. 1961: The La Concha Motel a 100-room motel designed by Williams opens. Located on the Strip across from Circus Circus the motel’s dramatic lobby operated on the Strip for more than 40 years Cornoyer said. In 2006 it was relocated to become and became the Neon Museum’s visitor center. 1963: St. Viator Guardian Angel Shrine with Williams’ modernistic A-frame design opens on the Strip. Now called Guardian Angel Cathedral the building underwent a renovation in 1995. 1966: Williams designs the SkyLift Magi-Cab a monorail system proposed for Las Vegas. According to The Paul Revere Williams Project the system would have had cars traveling from McCarran International Airport to 15 stations. Sources: Dave Cornoyer and research

See how she landed a guest role on 'Gunsmoke.'

Karen Grassle starred in Little House on the Prairie from 1974 until 1982. She officially left the show as a full-time cast member after gaining notoriety for playing Caroline “Ma” Ingalls. Before booking Little House the 78-year-old TV star appeared on another popular show of the 1970s era.

Karen Grassle studied theatre before ‘Little House on the Prairie’

Grassle spent her childhood in Berkley California. For her undergraduate career she attended H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College the women’s college for Tulane University at the time. While there Grassle discovered her love for acting. She eventually transferred to the University of California Berkeley. After graduating with BA degrees in 1965 in English and Dramatic Arts Grassle moved to London to accept the Fulbright Fellowship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.

During her time in London the actor worked with theatre companies across the country. However she found herself “flat broke” when she decided to try TV acting in Los Angeles. In 1973 she met with Michael Landon about playing his on-screen wife Ma Ingalls. Before that a movie she negotiated overseas stopped production when Grassle moved to California.

“I had spent a year in England working with a Shakespeare company and teaching and came back to the States flat broke” Grassle recalled per Closer. “I was asked to fly to LA to play the lead in an independent movie but when I got to the airport there was no ticket! I’d sublet my apartment and my boyfriend was [with me] so I wrote a bad check to get one! But when I got to LA the movie fell through.”

Karen Grassle connected with a ‘Little House on the Prairie’ cast member through ‘Gunsmoke’

Little House on the Prairie premiered on NBC in 1974. That same year Grassle’s episode of Gunsmoke aired. In her episode in the Western drama titled “The Wiving” she played Fran one of the three saloon girls kidnapped in Dodge by three men who want to marry them.

The episode was Grassle’s first and only appearance on the long-running show. However author David Greenland wrote in Landon’s biography Michael Landon: The Career and Artistry of a Television Genius that Gunsmoke connected her with another Little House actor.

“Classically trained actress Karen Grassle was cast as mother Caroline” the author said. “Coincidentally shortly before production began Grassle had filmed an episode of Gunsmoke directed by none other than Victor French.”

Karen Grassle’s net worth and her roles after ‘Little House on the Prairie’

According to Celebrity Net Worth Grassle has a current net worth of $500000. After eight years on Little House on the Prairie she decided to quit the show. As her and Landon’s TV children (Melissa Sue Anderson Melissa Gilbert and Sidney and Lindsay Greenbush) grew older the Bonanza star opted to step down as Pa Ingalls. However he and Grassle appeared in the show’s finale movie which aired in 1984.

Throughout the 1980s the actor guest-starred in Murder She Wrote. She also appeared in several movies including Between the Darkness and the Dawn and Wyatt Earp before taking a break from acting. As of 2020 Grassle resides in the San Francisco Bay Area and stays involved in local theatre."

In spite of all the progress made in Black representation in America these advances have yet to translate to the C-suite in corporate America. With the resignation of Tapestry CEO Jide Zeitlin in July 2020 the number of Black CEOs among the Fortune 500 dropped to a woeful four. One person will soon be added to that list as Rosalind Brewer Starbucks’ chief operating officer will take over as the CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance. She will be leaving Starbucks at the end of February and will then be the only Black woman CEO at a Fortune 500 company. Unfortunately this list will shrink again when Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier retires in June 2021.

Over the complete history of the Fortune 500 which dates back to 1999 there have only been a total of 18 Black CEOs leading America’s Fortune 500 companies. The peak year for representation was 2012 when a still-anemic total of six Black CEOs led corporate America’s most prominent companies. As Black History Month unfolds it’s a good time to take a closer look at the four Black CEOs paving the way for future leaders of color.

“These are investments in people that are important to our future” said Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon.

With the latest pay increase about 730000 of Walmart’s employees will make at least $15 an hour.

But these pay increases are only for some current employees. Walmart said its starting wage will stay at $11 an hour.

McMillon said that a minimum wage of $15 an hour was “an important target but also think that should be paced in a way that’s good for the U.S. economy.”

Other retailers such as Amazon Target and Best Buy have increased their starting minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Massive retailers have stayed mostly quiet about looming minimum wage increases.

But they have more to say when it comes to taking shots at the competition.

When Walmart announced on Thursday it was raising some workers' wages rival grocery chain Kroger was quick to have a response.

""We welcome Walmart's announcement to bring their average wage up to $15 an hour"" a company representative told Insider. ""At Kroger our average hourly wage has been $15 an hour since 2019.""

""In fact our average hourly associate rate reaches over $20 an hour when accounting for healthcare 401(K) and pensions that so many of our competitors choose not to offer"" the spokesperson added.

Sniping at Walmart is becoming a bit of a tradition in the retail industry. In December Amazon decided to take a swing at Walmart when Bloomberg reported that an Amazon warehouse opening drove down a county's average industry compensation.

""What surprises us is that we are the focus of a story like this when some of the country's largest employers including the largest retailer have yet to join us in raising the minimum wage to $15"" Amazon said in a statement to Bloomberg at the time.

With a $15 minimum wage already rolling out in many states and cities some companies are spending less time fighting new federal regulation and more time fighting each other.

""Generally I think most retailers would prefer wages to be left up to the market rather than legislated for"" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders told Insider.

""However a lot of retailers have been voluntarily increasing wages over the past few years so an increase to $15 is now not seen as such a big deal by some"" Saunders continued. ""Indeed many have raised or are in the process of delivering on promises to raise wages to $15.""

Higher pay for entry-level positions as well as better benefits and other perks typically means companies can hire more engaged workers who are less likely to quit. Retailers raise workers' pay because of regulation but also to better compete with rivals.

""One of the challenges for any retailers is turnover"" Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told Insider in October.

""Amazon has very liberal benefits programs even for part time employees"" O'Shea added. ""Walmart has got college covered. There's all sorts of bells and whistles that the retailers at the top end of the food chain have been able to do because they can afford it.""

Some major companies actually pay all workers at least $15 while others offer a wider range. Here is how some of the biggest players measures up.

Walmart minimum wage: $11 per hour

On Thursday Walmart announced that on March 13 it will roll out a raise that brings 425000 associates' pay to between $13 and $19 per hour. As a result the average pay for nearly half of hourly workers in the US will reach $15 per hour according to a Walmart representative.

""Those people that we're raising wages for tend to have been with us for a longer period of time than someone that might be earning the entry wage"" CEO Doug McMillon said on a call with investors this week. ""We're trying to ... create this ladder of opportunity providing an opportunity for people when they start with the company to build a career like so many of us already have.""

Costco minimum wage: $15 per hour

Costco raised its minimum wage to $15 in 2019. At the same time the company increased pay for supervisors and introduced paid bonding leave for all hourly employees.

The retailer has been celebrated by many workers as one of the best places to work in the industry.

""The best part is all the perks — guaranteed hours benefits time and a half on Sundays free turkeys at Thanksgiving four free memberships a livable wage"" an employee with six years of experience told Insider in 2018.

Target minimum wage: $15 per hour

In June Target raised its minimum wage to $15 up from $13. The raise was part of a multi-year effort with the company promising in 2017 that it would reach a $15 minimum hourly wage by the end of 2020.

""Everything we aspire to do and be as a company builds on the central role our team members play in our strategy their dedication to our purpose and the connection they create with our guests and communities"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement.

Kroger minimum wage: Varies by region

""Since the start of the pandemic Kroger has proudly invested over $1.5 billion to safeguard and reward our associates and committed nearly $1 billion to secure pensions for tens of thousands of our associates across the country"" a representative said in a statement.

Kroger has also faced backlash recently for closing stores in Seattle and California due to ""hero pay"" regulation that would have temporarily increase workers' wages by $4 per hour.

""The biggest issue for many right now is dealing with local ordinances mandating temporary hero pay boosts and bonuses"" Saunders said. ""This is causing a lot of issues and a patchwork of different wage structures. Many of the rules are illogical and hard to implement.""

Amazon minimum wage: $15 per hour

Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2018.

""At Amazon we believe $15 an hour is the minimum that anyone in the U.S. should be paid for an hour of labor"" Amazon said in a statement to Insider on Friday. ""That's why since 2018 every Amazon employee has earned a starting hourly wage of at least $15.""

""It's also why we're calling on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and urging other major corporations to increase wages to this level"" the statement continued.

The raises which vary in amount by location and market will take effect March 13.

John Furner chief executive officer of Walmart’s U.S. division said in a memo to employees Thursday that 425000 store workers in digital and stocking teams will get the raises with starting rates ranging from $13 to $19 per hour.

Walmart executives also mentioned the raises Thursday in the retailer’s annual meeting with investors.

The nation’s largest private employer Bentonville-based Walmart has about 1.5 million workers in the U.S.

Furner said in the memo that the raises are “an investment in our people at the same time we make new investments in our supply chain automation and technology.”

“It follows other actions we took last year including special covid-19 bonuses raising pay for 165000 key leadership roles and restructuring to a team-based model of working in our stores” Furner said.

Store workers “faced challenges that none of us could have predicted and for customers the items they needed — however they wanted to shop for them” Furner said. “You helped people feel safe and many of you played an invaluable role administering covid-19 tests and now vaccines.”

The 165000 workers who got raises in October under the new organizational structure included both salaried and hourly store employees said Dacona Smith chief financial officer for Walmart U.S.

Wages for hourly team leaders now start between $18 and $21 and can go up to $30 at supercenters Smith said when the changes were announced in September. In addition some workers in the bakery and deli areas saw their minimum hourly pay rise from $11 to $15.

Smith did not say how big a raise the salaried workers would get.

But Smith did say that beginning in the first quarter of this year all workers who got raises under the restructuring no longer will get the quarterly bonuses based on store performance that other employees receive.

It was unclear Friday whether the 425000 getting the latest round of raises will continue to receive the quarterly bonuses.

In 2018 Walmart raised its base starting pay to $11 an hour. Rival Target Corp. raised its minimum pay for all hourly workers from $13 to $15 in July.

Amazon.com Best Buy and Costco are among retailers that have also adopted a $15 minimum wage.

Worker advocacy group United for Respect responded to Thursday’s announcement with a statement that by its analysis about 760000 hourly Walmart workers will not get a wage increase “and likely will continue to make less than $15 an hour.”

The group has long pressed Walmart and other retailers to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour.

President Joe Biden has proposed gradually increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 hasn’t changed since 2009.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjAvNC1yZWFzb25zLXdoeS13YWxtYXJ0cy1zZWxsLW9mZi1pcy1hbi1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS1mb3ItbG9uZy10ZXJtLWludmVzdG9ycy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 reasons why Walmart's sell-off is an opportunity for investors willing to be a little patient,"On Wall Street many investors voted with their feet Thursday: They sold off Walmart shares as the company missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates  gave a disappointing outlook and warned some stay-at-home pandemic trends may be fading. Since the news broke more than $25 billion in market cap has vanished. Shares closed Friday at $138.34 valuing Walmart at $391.4 billion. The stock is up more than 17% over the past year but it's well off its 52-week high of $153.66 which it set on Dec. 1. One of the biggest issues is the $14 billion Walmart wants to invest in its business as it ramps up automation improves its supply chain and adds new customer services. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon tried to persuade investors that it's the right decision at the right time. He said he wants to tap new opportunities that will lift the retailer's bread-and-butter business of selling groceries and other merchandise. Simeon Gutman a Morgan Stanley retail analyst said the company's investments will weigh it down for the short term but set it up for the future as it fends off traditional players and threats like Amazon . The firm rates Walmart as overweight. It lowered its price target by $2 to $154 but that represents a nearly 10% gain from where shares are currently trading. ""The underlying message is 'We just had a very successful 2020'"" he said. ""Rather than let some of that harvest we're going to plow it back in and drill down and make our competitive advantage even stronger."" Here are four reasons why the company's strategy could be an opportunity for long-term investors: Walmart's reach gives it a leg up in the ads business. Walmart is the nation's largest retailer and private employer. More than 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of the company's stores. About 150 million people go to its stores website or apps every week. For the retailer that reach is a revenue opportunity . It wants to become one of the top 10 advertising platforms in the U.S. and surpass big players like Hearst Fox and Twitter in the next five years CFO Brett Biggs told investors Thursday. To grow that business it will amplify efforts to sell ads space on its app and website. It will also sell them on TV and checkout screens in stores — and even tailor them to local weather or customer preferences. For example it could promote a soup or hot chocolate brand on a snowy day or have a targeted ad for diapers appear on the self-checkout screen for a parent who regularly buys baby food. Brian Yarbrough consumer retail analyst at Edward Jones rates the company as neutral but said he sees advertising as a ""massive opportunity"" for the retailer. He said Walmart can track customer purchases in stores and online allowing it to better target ads to the right customers and show advertisers the return on their investment. And he said advertisers are looking to diversify beyond Facebook and Google  dominant players in the ad business. ""That's in my mind the biggest gamechanger in profitability because it's such a high-margin business"" Yarbrough said. Covid-19 vaccines spotlight Walmart's growing health-care business. In a new TV commercial Walmart touts a role it wants to play in more communities: Health-care provider. The video shows pharmacists in lab coats and said the company is ready to administer Covid shots. The retailer has gradually been expanding its health-care business. It already has pharmacies inside of thousands of its Supercenters and Sam's Club locations. It's opened 20 Walmart Health clinics next to its stores which offer low-priced therapy sessions dental checkups and doctor appointments. It recently broke into the insurance business by registering to sells supplemental Medicare insurance . Most of that expansion has happened with little fanfare or flash. At this week's investor day McMillon struck a different tone. He spoke about Walmart's big ambitions and described health care as a natural fit since the company is known for low prices trusted by many families and has large parking lots that can support health clinics. With Covid vaccines Walmart will step further into the health-care spotlight. Some of its pharmacies are receiving direct shipments of doses as part of a federal program. Jefferies analyst Steph Wissink said in a research note that administering the vaccines ""fits squarely with the [company's] strategy to be an accessible and affordable provider for basic healthcare."" She said the retailer's proximity to much of the U.S. population gives it a built-in advantage. Plus she said vaccines and medical appointments can drive foot traffic into its stores. She's rated Walmart as buy with a $180 price target and called the market's pullback on its stock ""a rare 'rollback' opportunity."" Stores are becoming mini warehouses for profitable e-commerce growth. Along with selling merchandise on the sales floor Walmart is turning dozens of its stores into mini warehouses . They will have automated systems that pair up robots and employees. Robots pick common items in the back of the store and personal shoppers gather bulk or fresh items such as steak on the sales floor. Walmart did not specify how many stores will get the automated systems but said they're part of its capital expenditures for the year ahead. Walmart's e-commerce business has had sharp growth particularly during the pandemic but is not profitable. Michael Lasser a UBS retail analyst said automation brings the company a step closer by fulfilling curbside pickup and home delivery orders more efficiently. The retailer currently uses people to pick and pack each online order which increases labor costs and makes it hard to keep up with high demand. His rating is buy and price target for the company is $165. With the automated systems he said Walmart can handle a heavier volume of online orders and improve the customer experience. Not only will shoppers get their groceries and other items faster he said. When they go to stores they'll have fewer personal shoppers crowding the aisles. Walmart+ can woo customers and win more of wallets. Walmart wants to have a more powerful pull even among its current customers. One way it aims to do that is Walmart+ a subscription service that it launched in the fall . It costs $98 a year or $12.95 for a month of service. The retailer hasn't shared the number of subscribers but a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners analysis estimated that it has 7.4 million to 8.2 million customers so far. That's a small number compared with rival Amazon Prime which has grown to approximately 126 million U.S. subscribers as of October according to a CIRP estimate. That service has a 15-year advantage though and indicates the stickiness of membership programs and their potential to grow. Lasser of UBS said Walmart+ will entice customers to spend more with the retailer similar to Amazon Prime because the company will be top of mind. ""It allows them to capture more share of their existing customer more share of their wallet and grab new customers"" he said. Gutman said the service creates built-in recurring revenue — a factor that investors typically like. And he said its central perks — unlimited home grocery delivery and free shipping — could win over middle- and upper-income families that are new or occasional Walmart shoppers and turn them into frequent buyers. No doubt Walmart's investments may take a while to pan out and they could flop. Also the boost it received from the pandemic makes gauging its growth all the more challenging. Last fiscal year Walmart grew its revenue by $35 billion. ""That is the thing that the entire Street is wrestling with"" said Edward Jones' Yarbrough. ""How many years of growth did these companies pull forward? Could you have a period where you have two or three years of flattish sales and flattish earnings? Eventually you are going to have to comp those comps and they are going to be difficult."" —CNBC's Christopher Hayes contributed to this report.

Starting Oct. 1 Cinderella Castle will premiere a new paint job and lighting effects at night which will make it appear to shimmer with jewels and gold ribbons. There will also be a nighttime light projection show that will tie in the other three theme parks and will run for 18 months Disney said.

Epcot’s Spaceship Earth will have new lights that will shine across the reflective panels of the iconic globe creating a night sky that is being called “a symbol of optimism.” The Epcot lighting package will remain permanently after the anniversary celebration ends Disney said.

At Animal Kingdom the Tree of Life will have “magical fireflies.” The Hollywood Tower Hotel at Disney’s Hollywood Studios will receive special upgrades that will evoke Hollywood’s golden age.

“At night our four park icons are going to come to life with a magical iridescent glow covered in pixie dust that we call the beacons of magic” said Dana Carlson associate broadcast producer with Disney Live Entertainment.

Mickey and Minnie Mouse will also get new costumes that Disney dubbed “EARidescence.” The mouse couple will be clad in special iridescent attire with gold shoes and bows and sparkly patterns on their costumes similar to when Cinderella Castle is backed by fireworks.

Spreading the 50th anniversary event over 18 months could help thin out crowds eager to see the changes. The parks continue to limit occupancy to less than half typical levels due to the ongoing pandemic.

COVID-19 shut down the parks in mid-March before they reopened in July with limits on distancing mask requirements. Disney did away with parades and fireworks to reduce crowds gathering. All park attendance is managed with an advanced reservation system and Disney has stopped selling new annual passes.

For those who aren’t familiar with the company this studio is known for forging such films as “Robots” “The Peanuts Movie” “Rio” “Epic” and their most profitable film franchise the “Ice Age” series.

According to Deadline the reasoning behind Blue Sky closing its doors are pandemic-related predicaments that Disney is faced with — both in terms of sustaining business within their film production company and closures of theme parks and cruise ship dockings. Due to these circumstances it became evident that it wasn’t feasible for Disney to bear a third animation film company to their roster of properties they own.

“Given the current economic realities” a Disney studio spokesperson said “after much consideration and evaluation we have made the difficult decision to close filmmaking operations at Blue Sky Studios.” Blue Sky’s final days will be in April 2021.

This decision will leave 450 employees currently working for the animation production company unemployed. However Disney will still maintain ownership of Blue Sky’s library of computer-generated animated films and characters. It is also noted that an Ice Age television show conducted by an unnamed studio under the Disney umbrella has been said to be already in development as a Disney+ exclusive.

Blue Sky Studios came into existence in Feb. 22 1987 by Chris Wedge Michael Ferraro Carl Ludwig and three other founders who once worked as animators for Mathematical Applications Group Inc. (also known as MAGI) a revolutionary visual effects firm hired by Disney to design the magnificent effects for 1982’s “Tron”. How coincidental! Shortly after the film’s release MAGI sadly ran out of business and closed down.

The inception of Blue Sky becoming an animation powerhouse all started when Wedge released an animated project in 1998 called “Bunny” a short about an old widowed bunny agitated by a moth only to be led to reunite with her husband in the afterlife. Winning Best Animated Short at the Academy Awards this project gave Blue Sky the motivation to go from a visual effects company that worked on films in the late 90’s like “Joe’s Apartment” and “Fight Club” to becoming an animated film studio capable of creating full-length features of their own.

Blue Sky’s first attempt at an animated film was the surprise critical and financial hit of 2002 “Ice Age” a film that gave birth to the studio’s company mascot Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel. This movie was the very foundation that laid the groundwork for future animated films like “Robots” (2005) “Epic” (2013) “Rio” (2011) and “The Peanuts Movie” (2015) including for four more installments in the “Ice Age” franchise that with all five films together combined generated an estimate profit of $3.2 billion at the box office worldwide. Their last animated flick “Spies in Disguise” was released in 2019 and starred Will Smith and Tom Holland. Box office-wise it was the film that performed the worst grossing $66 million domestically and $171 million globally.

Rest in Peace Blue Sky Studios. May you always be remembered in your prime and that all of our childhood memories of you remain in our hearts forever."

The Atlanta-based owner of ApartmentGuide.com Rent.com and Rentals.com is set to be acquired in a cash deal worth $608 million.

The operational details of the transaction are expected to be released in the near-term. The deal is subject to certain customary closing conditions which include antitrust approval and approval from a bankruptcy court. RentPath’s rental listings on Redfin.com are expected be integrated in late 2022.

With the acquisition Redfin (RDFN) will join together a site for buying a home with a site for renting a home creating more options for individuals seeking a home.

Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said “RentPath has more than 20000 apartment buildings on its rental websites and grew its traffic more than 25% last year.” (See Redfin stock analysis on TipRanks)

“We can almost double that audience as one in five of Redfin.com’s 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent. Together with RentPath we can create an online destination for every North American to find a home” he added.

Following the deal Stifel Nicolaus analyst John Egbert reiterated a Hold rating and a price target of $65 (33% downside potential) on the stock. The analyst views “the deal favorably as it effectively broadens Redfin’s suite of real estate services to all U.S. consumers for a reasonable cost for the assets acquired.”

The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 3 Buys and 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $74.40 implies 23% downside potential to current levels. Shares have already jumped almost 41% so far this year.

Redfin scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

(WLBT) - Waste Management is expected to resume regular residential and commercial pickup for customers in Central and Southwest Mississippi Monday Feb. 22 pending road and safety conditions.

Meanwhile the company announced it would begin some limited commercial and roll-off services Saturday.

“Waste Management thanks our valued customers for their patience and cooperation during this weather event” said Katie Cowen senior district manager Waste Management Gulf Coast.

Starting March 8 homeowners in Arvada will be asked to choose from three sizes of trash cans with the price of service going up with the volume of the receptacle. It’s an incentive-based approach — already in use in several Colorado communities — designed to get people to throw away less and help cities better meet sustainability goals.

It sounds good on paper but there’s a catch: For people who decline to transition Arvada will impose a mandatory $5.13 monthly “minimum service” fee. Non-payment could result in a lien being placed on a homeowner’s property.

There’s a growing contingent of Arvadans who think the city is sticking its nose where it shouldn’t. One person on a city message board likened the service fee to extortion.

“We are opposed to a city-mandated monopoly for trash service in Arvada and we’re asking people to exercise their right of choice and opt out” said Jonah Hearne a 20-year resident who next month plans to go door to door with dozens of like-minded citizens urging neighbors to reject the new program.

For Tom D’Agostino a three-year Arvada resident who is happy with the service he gets from his contracted hauler Waste Connections the city’s levy is a no-go.

“I’m not going to pay for something that I’m not going to use” he said.

City officials say the opt-out fee which is less than what other communities with similar programs charge is necessary to make the program feasible on a citywide basis. And residents will still get waste services — bulky item and leaf and yard waste drop-off events — even if they stay with their current hauler.

Colorado’s seen this fight play out in several Denver suburbs. Next door to Arvada Westminster residents crowded council chambers in 2017 to denounce the city’s plan to implement a centralized trash collection system.

Two years later voters in Lakewood shot down a ballot measure that would have authorized the city to manage garbage pickup there. Arvada itself looked at consolidating trash service a decade ago before tabling the idea in the face of opposition.

The Arvada City Council passed the current plan in June and it is scheduled to start July 5.

Kate Bailey a policy and research director for Boulder-based Eco-Cycle Inc. consulted with Arvada on its new trash collection plan. She said the hubbub over the issue might seem puzzling to much of the rest of the U.S. where municipal trash service is more common.

“People from the rest of the country look at us like we’re nuts” she said. “This makes a lot of sense and yet it’s oddly political.”

Incentive to recycle

Arvada will be taking a single-hauler approach to garbage collection contracting with Republic Services for citywide service in contrast to the nine different haulers that currently provide residential pickup service in the city.

The city will also use the pay-as-you-throw model which is already in place in several Front Range communities including Lafayette Louisville Golden and Sheridan. Arvada would be the state’s largest city to embrace it.

The principle is straightforward: The more you toss the more you pay. In Arvada a 95-gallon trash cart will cost $19.76 a month a 65-gallon cart $15.63 a month and a 35-gallon cart — which can hold three to four kitchen-sized bags — will cost $11.50 a month.

Every household in the program gets a 95-gallon recycling bin at no charge which Bailey says will goose recycling levels. The proof is in the data she added.

According to Eco-Cycle the top recycling communities on the Front Range have citywide programs that automatically provide bins — and communities using a pay-as-you-throw approach stand out Bailey said.

Loveland which charges as little as $3.25 a month for a 17-gallon trash bin is at the top of the list with a 60% recycling rate. Louisville and Lafayette are at 44% and 36% respectively. Arvada’s recycling rate is below 15% according to past surveys of haulers Bailey said.

Colorado’s recycling rate was less than half the national average in 2019 according to a study released last fall.

“Pay-as-you-throw does have a behavior modification element to it much like tiered pricing for water use helps to incentivize water conservation” Bailey said.

A 2018 study by the University of New Hampshire found among 34 towns that used the pay-as-you-throw model waste disposal rates dropped between 42% and 54% according to reporting from The Associated Press. Another study in neighboring Maine found that cities with the incentive-based system generated approximately 44% less trash per capita than communities without the program.

In Sheridan a working-class suburb south of Denver City Manager Devin Granbery said the city’s pay-as-you-throw program has brought noticeable benefits since it launched in 2014.

“Recycling has gone from virtually zero to 75% of our residents participating in curbside recycling with a diversion rate of 15%” he said.

The system also helps cut down on street maintenance Louisville Public Works Director Kurt Kowar said. The Boulder County city has had a pay-as-you-throw garbage collection program in place since 2010.

“Trucks have a huge impact when turning and areas such as cul-de-sacs get torn up over time” Kowar said. “In general a trash truck equals 1000 cars per day on the road.”

That’s important to Rachael Smallwood who moved to Arvada from North Dakota five years ago. She’s one of dozens of city residents who have praised the program online.

“It was a shock that there were so many ginormous trucks putting out all that pollution” she said. “That’s important to me as our climate crisis gets worse.”

Smallwood said she barely fills a third of her trash can per week and will be opting for the smallest container Arvada offers giving her a huge discount off of the $30 she pays monthly now.

“Put it on a ballot”

But for opponents of Arvada’s single-hauler trash system they’re not just bothered by what they perceive as a heavy-handed approach to garbage collection. They say the means by which the new program was approved — a slender 4-3 margin by the City Council in the middle of a pandemic rather than a vote of the people — is problematic.

“If you all of a sudden change the relationship between the city and the citizens — then put it on a ballot” Hearne said. “The city is collecting money that a lot of people consider a tax and giving it to a private company.”

Last year’s vote so incensed some Arvada residents that they launched an effort to recall the four council members who voted for it. The recall never made it to the ballot.

Mayor Marc Williams who opposed the single-hauler contract also felt the issue should have gone to the voters. But he said “the council has spoken.”

“I knew this would be as contentious as it was 10 years ago” Williams said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZm94MTcuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGVyc29uLXNob3Qta2lsbGVkLWF0LWF0LXB1dG5hbS1jb3VudHktd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1mYWNpbGl0edIBYWh0dHBzOi8vZm94MTcuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3BlcnNvbi1zaG90LWtpbGxlZC1hdC1hdC1wdXRuYW0tY291bnR5LXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtZmFjaWxpdHk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man shot killed at Putnam County waste management facility,"MONTEREY Tenn. -- One person is killed at a county-owned waste management facility in Putnam County.

All property is not equal and does not have the same legal treatment. Property can be private or public but all private property is of course as in any other country subject to various legal limitations.

For example at a very basic level all properties are subject to the Law of Roads and the Law of Waters (yes waters in plural); or all property is potentially subject to expropriation if a serious public need should arise. This is the same the world over.

Registered Vs. Unregistered Property in Costa Rica

Property in C.R. can be registered or unregistered. Registered property has gone through a detailed verification process along with the property map which ensures the property´s existence its characteristics its ownership and limitations.

Properties that are not registered have a much lower level of protection. For example all the information on a registered property is not only public but it is legally deemed to be true unless it is demonstrated to be false in a court proceeding.

All registered properties are identified by numbers which indicate the province where the property is located the number that identifies the property itself and the number of owners.

Urban Vs Rural Properties in Costa Rica

Private urban properties that have a long established history are very safe and therefore more expensive because all the rights limitations and obligations on these properties are pretty clear and well known.

Land that is located in rural areas or undeveloped areas can be trickier because the interested parties: owners investors pressure groups the government and so on are still trying to shape these areas. In these rural areas property owners can end up becoming involved in Agrarian and/or Environmental Law.

Agrarian Vs. Environmental Law

Costa Rica has a long and distinguished history in an area of the law called Agrarian and Environmental Law. Agrarian Law regulates property in which there is the development of a biological cycle of production (i.e. plantations cattle farms fish farms etc.). Environmental Law seeks to protect the ecosystems.

This area of the law (Agrarian Law) was especially developed in Italy in the 1920´s by a famous agrarian lawyer Dr. Antonio Carozza and was further developed by my post graduate professor Dr. Ricardo Zeledón and has propagated to many countries that have wisely or in some cases unwisely set limits on the rights of property.

Agrarian Law is regulated by the Agrarian Code which is a set of very complex and important laws. Properties can be limited by their trees by the fauna which dwell on it or pass through it by the swamps and wetlands (humedales) which exist on it or near it by the forests on it or near it and many others.

In the most extreme cases the great fear is that a person can “lose” their property because someone has squatted on their land and has acquired legal rights to the property or because the land cannot be developed due to property limitations such as beachfront property or land necessary to protect the water supply.

It would be impossible to explain all the ins and outs of property limitations and agrarian law in a single article. Nevertheless there are some basic interesting concepts.

Third Party Property Ownership

The reason why the law allows a third party to acquire rights on a property is because there is a basic social and philosophical concept that land must serve a social purpose and therefore it is not enough to simply own the land because land must be put to good use.

This concept came into conflict with itself when people started arguing the concept of “environmental possession” which means precisely not doing anything with the land (no forms of land exploitation) in order to protect it its ecosystems and the environment.

In principle the law in Costa Rica is as strict as in any other jurisdiction as far as property rights. The owner has the right to defend his property and if the property has a registered title it should be well protected from any kind of abuse. Nevertheless the reality of the situation is complex and untidy.

Properties especially very large “fincas” can have boundary issues (the property boundaries and fences are unkept) or the property may not be well maintained and therefore those that would take advantage of that situation argue that the property is “abandoned”.

There can be tragic social issues such as large groups of extremely poor people many of them manipulated by “organizers” who invade these properties and live in squalor often causing deep damage to the property the community and the environment.

Possession and Property Ownership

The main legal concept that a property owner must contend with is the concept of “possession”. In the end the “right of property” is nothing more than a series of other rights such as the right to transform the property to use it to sell it defend it etc. and the main right is the right of possession.

It is important in properties that are in danger of being invaded by squatters that there be some kind of real possession by the owners. The problem is that often enough property owners are taken advantage of because they live overseas they don’t know the language the customs or the law or they simply don’t have the funds to take care of a large piece of land.

One option is to establish a forestry program on the property. Another option is to rent the property to a reputable neighbor that will have some meaningful activity on the property.

Defending Property Ownership in Costa Rica

It is important to mention that there are several ways of “defending” a property. If a person feels his property is being threatened there is an expedited court procedure called “interdicto” (similar to an injunction) which is a very summarized court proceeding that deals only with issues of possession.

The problem is that nowadays with so many justified and unjustified delays a summarized procedure can feel like an eternity to the aggrieved party.

The importance of possession is that in order for a person to acquire any rights on a property their possession must be in good faith public pacific (nonviolent) uninterrupted and it must be a possession as an owner which means he must publicly present himself as the property owner.

For a person to argue the right of possession he/she must have acquired that possession through legitimate means. If any of these legal requirements is missing that person’s possession would be illegal. Of course it is one thing to say these things in theory and quite another to argue them and prove them in court.

There is also an administrative procedure which is handled by the Ministry of Security in which the owner proves he owns the land and that he legally has the right of possession and if so the police will evict the invader in a relatively short time.

The main thing is to exercise the proper prevention by making sure the property to be purchased is in a perfect legal situation. Often people acquire property in a legal situation that is less than ideal because they´re buying at bargain prices and then they are disappointed because they cannot obtain the full measure of protection of the law.

It is essential that your lawyer perform an in-depth investigation of the property´s history to make certain the property was born legally and has a perfect legal profile.

The 76ers are trying to bring fans back to the Wells Fargo Center.

They had up to 100 family members staff members and friends in attendance for Friday night’s 112-105 win over the Chicago Bulls. It was the second straight game the team was able to do that and the guests had to stay in a suite. Their attendance became obvious when several of the attendees were shown on the arena’s jumbotron.

Now the hope is to soon have that number of fans increase.

The Sixers Flyers and Wells Fargo Center officials recently sent the city a proposal to have 5000 fans in attendance for games beginning some time next month according to sources. One of the sources said the Sixers would be satisfied with a limit of 2500.

Before Wednesday’s game against the Houston Rockets the Sixers had played in front of only media members and team officials.

“It’s gonna be fun” star center Joel Embiid said when asked about the possibility of fans returning. “You know hopefully soon as long as everybody stays healthy and the conditions are met for that to happen.”

The Sixers have played in front of fans during several road games this season including the team’s recent Western Conference road trip. Fans provided solid atmospheres in games at the Phoenix Suns last Saturday and Utah Jazz on Monday.

“It almost felt like it was full at times” Embiid said of the atmospheres in Phoenix and Utah. “The energy was great.”

Embiid said it would be “a different story in Philadelphia. They care and they are going to come to games and they are going to boo you. They are going to show up for you. But at the end of the day it’s all love.”

More than a dozen NBA teams are currently allowing fans in the stands.

According to a report by Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer the Sixers Flyers and Wells Fargo Center sent Philadelphia a proposal to have 5000 fans in attendance for games beginning sometime next month.

The Wells Fargo Center has a capacity of 19537 fans so that would be just over one-quarter full (25.59%).

Pompey also reported that one source said the Sixers would be satisfied with a limit of 2500 fans. You’d have to assume that the Flyers would likely be fine with that arrangement as well.

The Flyers have hosted essential staff (including Gritty) media and a COVID-19 frontline worker family at each game this season. The Sixers had up to 100 family members staff and friends in at their past two games this week.

This is great news for fans who are hoping to cheer on the Flyers in person this season. It’s also good to hear as a follow-up to the Wells Fargo Center receiving a high healthy-safety rating on February 2nd:

“In an important step toward welcoming fans back to the arena later this year Wells Fargo Center has been awarded the WELL Health-Safety Rating for Facility Operations and Management a widely-respected evidence-based third-party verified rating of the venue’s health and safety protocols. Wells Fargo Center home to the NHL’s Flyers and NBA’s 76ers and a premier destination for entertainers and artists is the first events venue in Pennsylvania to achieve this prestigious distinction.”

Being able to safely host spectators could be huge for the Flyers and their fans.

So if the target is sometime next month when could Flyers fans return to the Wells Fargo Center?

In March the Flyers host two four-game homestands: 7th to 13th and 22nd to 27th. If fans are allowed starting sometime next month those could be the target dates. After that the Flyers are home on the 5th 6th and 11th in early April.

Only seven NHL teams are hosting fans at games at a limited capacity. The Arizona Coyotes (25%) Columbus Blue Jackets (10%) Dallas Stars (30%) Florida Panthers (25%) Nashville Predators (15%) St. Louis Blues (7.5%) and Tampa Bay Lightning (23%) are those teams. On February 23rd the teams in New York – the Buffalo Sabres New York Islanders and New York Rangers – will be able to host fans at 10% capacity.

If Philadelphia approves the proposal the Flyers could soon join that list.

WST,West Pharmaceutical Services,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAyLzIwL2NvdmlkLTE5LXBhdGVudC1zeXN0ZW0tcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWwtaW5kdXN0cnktZGVsaW5rYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 has shown how Big Pharma is broken,"In 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report highlighting sixteen pathogens that posed a serious threat to global health and which were desperately underfunded when it came to research. One of the sixteen pathogens was of course coronavirus — meaning not the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which didn't exist yet; but the class of coronaviruses generally which includes the viruses that cause SARS and MERS.

The prophetic report was intended to be a call to arms for the world's largest pharmaceutical companies who collectively invest billions every year in R&D for pathogens that already pose a threat to humanity or which soon will. Yet despite WHO's warning Big Pharma did not listen. Two years later in 2018 the pharmaceutical giants had zero research projects in development to fight coronaviruses.

Clearly the WHO was right; and understandably by 2020 pharmaceutical companies were throwing money at studying coronaviruses. Yet still they have done little to heed the WHO's warnings about the other sixteen pathogens: a report released last month by the Access to Medicine Foundation shows that by 2020 only 6 out of the 16 pathogens had any research in the pipelines. Of those research projects the vast majority – 63 out of 76 – were for COVID-19. Because the other pathogens hadn't killed enough people in the west (though the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus one of the sixteen pathogens is sweeping its way through Africa and India) Big Pharma was reluctant to cough up money for the R&D.

It might be strange from where the world is sitting now to imagine that the pharma industry once thought it had nothing to gain from researching coronavirus. After all COVID-19 is the gift that will keep on giving to Big Pharma for years to come. There are booster shots to be delivered and very lucrative monoclonal antibodies to be made. Given how profitable COVID-19 has been for the industry one might think it would warrant more attention from savvy for-profit corporations looking to profit off of the next pandemic.

So why can't the pharmaceutical giants heed the WHO's warnings? In order to understand why Big Pharma ignored coronavirus until it became a global pandemic one must understand its twisted business model.

Pharmaceutical companies make money by discovering drugs and then protecting those drugs with artificial monopolies through patents. Without competition drug companies can then turn around and charge whatever price they want for the new drug. It makes sense for pharma companies to prioritize research for diseases that have the richest patients — while paying little heed to diseases that kill poorer patients. This means that diseases like cancer and diabetes receive lots of research funding and diseases like Ebola Zika virus and malaria don't. Unless the industry is certain there are high rewards in the future no pharma company is going to take the risk to find a cure. In other words Big Pharma isn't interested in investing in medicines for deadly diseases if there's no guarantee of high rewards . An example is anti-microbial resistance (AMR). If you are one of the unfortunate souls to get gonorrhoea your doctor is likely to prescribe you a line of antibiotics. The problem with getting gonorrhoea (other than the physical discomfort and awkward phone calls to former lovers) is that this STD is getting increasingly difficult to treat because of its growing resistance to antibiotics. A 2014 study from Chatham House predicted that by 2050 AMR will kill 10 million people and cost the global economy an estimated $100 trillion. While those are staggering numbers what makes an antibiotic different from say a cancer drug is that doctors don't want to prescribe them; overprescription is what creates more resistance . This creates a disincentive for these for-profit corporations to make the kinds of new drugs that might help fight anti-microbial resistant pathogens. As an attorney from a Big Pharma company said to me once a year back ""think of AMRs like fire hydrants. You need them but you never want to use them.""

The problem is that by using it the disease eventually becomes resistant — and then you need new line of antibiotics. And drug companies do not want to invest in medicines if doctors are reluctant to prescribe them. A report from the Pew Charitable Trusts showed there are only 42 new antibiotics in development while for cancer there are over 1100 treatments in the pipelines. It makes more business sense to spend money in cancer for the growing numbers of sick westerners than it does in an antibiotic that you're not sure will ever be used. The underlying problem here is that as a society we have entrusted private companies the incredible task of finding cures for sick people. It is an established fact that drug prices are not decided based on R&D costs but on the maximum amount pharma companies think they can charge. The old line goes that Big Pharma needs to charge such high prices to cover the costs of drug research and reinvest in new medicines. For starters this argument is baseless. A report from 2017 looked at the simple price differences between the US and Europe for the top 20 best-selling drugs. In 2015 the net price difference between the two regions was $116 billion while the global R&D costs were just $76 billion. Pfizer the maker of one of the COVID vaccines made back more than twice its R&D spending through American premium pricing in just one year. That money is not flowing back into research pipelines but is instead lining the pockets of the company's shareholders.

Pharma companies often defend their high drug prices by claiming that they need to charge a lot because most drugs fail in clinical trials and the cost of bringing new drugs to market is getting more expensive. These are true statements. Most drugs do fail but they fail early on in phase I trials and much of that early research is funded with public money. A 2018 report showed that the US National Institute of Health (NIH) contributed funding to all 210 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 2010 and 2016 and provided $100 billion in research money. American taxpayers are covering the cost of medical research and getting slammed with inflated drug prices in return.The pharma folks I speak with argue vehemently against changing the system. One thing they tell me is that the public will have very little appetite to pay for all the research that goes into failed medicines. This is a ridiculous argument as we are already covering the costs of failed drug research while paying excess billions in drug prices for successful research. The drug companies will also point to the success of the COVID-19 vaccines as an example of their speedy efficiency. They casually ignore the vast sums of money they accepted from governments that made it all possible in the first place. The Moderna vaccine was funded entirely with US tax money and the AstraZeneca vaccine was developed at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University with public funding. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was also made possible with almost half a billion dollars from the German government. The private companies would not have been able to get a drug to market so quickly if the public hadn't paid for it first.

There is an alternative way to discover new medicines that is not reliant on patents to create incentives for drug research. The system is known as delinkage. The idea is that instead of having pharma companies use patents to create monopolies and charge ridiculous prices for drugs governments will offer a combination of cash prizes contracts and tax credits as market entry rewards to fund research. This means that drug prices would be directly tied to the cost of developing the drug rather than whatever pharma companies believe a desperate dying patient should be willing to pay for it.

The delinkage movement is gaining some momentum. In 2017 Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to delink the incentives awarded to pharma companies through the patent system and replace it with public market entry awards. Sanders' so-called Medical Innovation Prize Fund would be equal to 0.55% of GDP amounting to $102 billion in research funding. Across the pond the former UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a study in delinkage in his 2019 Medicines for the Many policy proposal.

Delinkage is not an idea unique to the left. Andrew Witty former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline  proposed delinkage as a way to fund research for rare diseases ; Joseph Stiglitz the 2001 winner for the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics has also argued to replace the patent system with market entry rewards. One of the many benefits of delinkage would be cheaper drugs but also drugs for a wider range of diseases. Hence the next time the WHO says that a research is needed for new pathogens governments could create a cash prize to incentivize pharma companies so that there's research in the pipelines to help bring a drug to market faster.

Another advantage to delinkage is the sharing of information. Under the current patent system pharma companies hoard their data and research from competitors who could use it to develop their own drug. Under delinkage all information and data could be made public ly available so that scientists can avoid repeating mistakes that another research team has already made. The open sharing of information is hugely important in COVID-type scenarios when time is of the essence.

But the biggest reason to change the current way we fund research is not just about efficiency and pricing but morality. Neo liberalism has given everything even human life a price tag. Farmers in India will die because a cancer drug hasn't come off patent. Millions of others die needlessly from HIV even though PrEP has been around for decades. And the vaccine rollout has shown that despite worldwide movements for racial equality rich white countries will get relief from COVID months if not years before those in the developing world. If patents were no longer an issue countries like India and South Africa wouldn't have to go to the WTO begging for permission to waive intellectual property rights so they can make their own COVID vaccines and therapies. What it all comes down to is the notion of fairness — the idea that someone's right to live should never be determined by how much money they make. Neoliberalism posits a contrary worldview to that.

Anthropologist Margret Mead said once that the first sign of civilization was a thighbone that had been broken and then healed. As she explains in the animal kingdom animals die if their bones break as they can no longer get water and food nor protect themselves. That first healed thighbone is proof that somebody in that society carried the person to safety and tended to their wound.

If we are to consider ourselves civilized we need to make sure that we provide medicines to everyone who needs them regardless of their income where they live or the illness they suffer from.",,,,,,,,,,,,

WD My Passport SSD 4.0 / 5

The WD My Passport SSD is an inexpensive and reasonable way to upgrade storage on your MacBook Pro packed into a stylish and compact casing you can carry around anywhere.

If you have picked up an M1-equipped Mac mini or MacBook Air one of the things that will be an issue is expanding its storage capacity. Since there are no upgrade options available consumers will have to instead look to external storage options and that typically means a portable hard drive of some description.

Western Digital's My Passport line is long-running and one that aims to provide storage that can move with the user wherever they go. The My Passport SSD has been updated for 2020 improving its speed and refreshing the appearance of the portable drive.

Key specs

Options for up to 2TB in capacity

256-bit AES hardware encryption

USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 ready

USB Type-C to USB Type-A converter included

Up to 1050MB/s read speeds and 1000MB/s write speeds

Drop protection to 6.5 feet

3.94 inches by 2.17 inches by 0.35 inches

5-year warranty

Small stature

The My Passport SSD's casing is small measuring just 0.35 inches thick 3.94 inches long and 2.17 inches wide. It's also fairly light with a weight of 45.7 grams (1.6 ounces).

While a little larger than the previous generation and slightly thinner the drive is still extremely pocketable and can easily be carried around in a bag.

The two-tone casing of the previous version has been switched for a metal enclosure with a sweeping motif and is available in a variety of five colors. While the last version was a little garish the new version is understated but is still stylish in its own right.

The metal casing also helps keep it protected with its shock and vibration resistance accompanied by drop resistance to a height of up to 6.5 feet. This means the drive will easily take the rigors of daily use without too much trouble.

One good design choice is the use of a separate USB-C cable which is easily user-replaceable. This does open up the possibility of losing the cable itself but it will still work with any USB Type-C cable.

As well as being supplied with a (too short) USB Type-C to Type-C cable WD includes a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter in the box. This gives the ability out-of-the-box for the drive to work with USB-A 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports at slower speeds.

We're not fond of this cable and the rigidity of the cable isn't great. Fortunately better replacement cables are cheap and plentiful.

The drive is listed as supporting USB 3.2 Gen 2 at up to 10Gb/s. Given that it is a USB drive it is backward compatible with the right cabling.

Capacity and performance

As part of the refresh WD has updated the type of storage inside the drive itself moving the line over to higher-speed NVMe. WD claims read speeds of up to 1050MB/s and write speeds of up to 1000MB/s on USB-C 3.2 gen 2.

WD offers the drive in three capacities covering 500GB 1TB and 2TB with the 1TB version used for this review.

We routinely saw speeds of about 930 megabytes per second write and 910 megabytes per second read in the real world. With extended hammering of the drive speed test thermal throttling drove speeds down to about 720 megabytes per second read and write — still faster than a single SATA-based SSD can deliver.

WD My Passport SSD 1TB speeds

When connected to a USB 3.0 type A port speeds were limited to about 410 megabytes per second for reads and 400 megabytes per second write. These speeds are about what we expected given the limitations of the port.

Security and compatibility

Like the earlier version WD includes 256-bit AES hardware encryption in the drive allowing users to encrypt the data with a minimal hit to performance. The encryption element relies on using the included WD Discovery software which can also be used to automate backups but does require Internet activation beforehand.

The WD Discovery for Mac software is adequate but we aren't going to delve into it too much here. When encryption is enabled speeds are limited to about 700 megabytes per second read and 550 megabytes per second write on a 15-inch i9 2018 MacBook Pro or an M1 Mac mini and a hair less on a 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro.

While WD has its own backup software Mac users have better options. For starters not even including third-party cloning software the drive also supports macOS's Time Machine. However it does have to be reformatted beforehand — which most Mac users generally do anyway unless they're working cross-platform.

WD states the drive will work right out of the box with exFAT formatting on both PCs and Macs. On the PC side it supports both Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 and can do so for other operating systems again with reformatting.

Small and mighty

For those needing to have external storage you can't really go wrong with the WD My Passport SSD. Its use of NVMe means it is faster than ever before coupled with the metal enclosure and built-in hardware encryption can help keep your precious data safe.

Its small size and high capacity make it a no-brainer for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro users to bring along with them. The drive is also reasonably priced for what it provides and is a good option to expand storage — albeit externally — on Macs that can sometimes have very high pricing on additional storage internally.

The WD My Passport SSD is a solid uninspiring external USB-C drive a product that is readily available from most electronics manufacturers. Not everything needs to be ground-breaking or have record-breaking speeds. Sometimes you need a $10 hammer to get the job done instead of a $120 ergonomic design custom-tailored to fit your hand.

The WD My Passport SSD is the epitome of the right tool to get the work done without breaking the bank.

Pros

Compact size and lightweight.

Separate USB Type-C cable.

Shock and drop resistant.

Adequate but not great encryption suite.

Fast transfer speeds

Cons

Included cable is quite short.

Reformatting needed for Time Machine.

Barron Trump is President of the United States. People are leaving Earth to inhabit one of Jupiter’s moons 500 million miles away.

This sounds like a dystopian nightmare but luckily it’s just the backstory of Good Kid Twisted Fantasy the latest Kanye-inspired mashup album from Toasty Digital a 26-year-old technical editor who moonlights as an internet DJ and Yeezy superfan. Following up his last project Kanye 2049 Toasty sets Good Kid one year later in 2050 as the soundtrack to a space-bound Kendrick Lamar’s cryogenic sleep.

Out February 21 Good Kid Twisted Fantasy blends together two of the most beloved and critically acclaimed hip-hop albums of all time — Kendrick Lamar’s good kid m.A.A.d city and Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The mashup album’s 11 tracks consist only of songs and samples from Kendrick and Kanye’s landmark LPs and every song from each album is utilized in some capacity on GKTF.

Toasty introduces the mashup album with “GET MUCH HIGHER” which lays the exclamatory opening lyrics to “Backseat Freestyle” over the heavenly choir from “Dark Fantasy.” Later on Kendrick and Kanye trade verses on “MONEY POWER” which effortlessly glides between “Power” “Money Trees” “All Of The Lights” and “Swimming Pools.” Mixing together these legendary tracks is like assembling an NBA All-Star team — the individual parts are great but putting them together can yield an even more extraordinary yet unpredictable result.

“It’s a dream collaboration.”

The project’s centerpiece is “MAAD WORLD” in which Toasty fuses Kendrick’s harsh staccato rap from “m.A.A.d city” with the melancholic mellifluence of the “Blame Game” instrumental. The fluttering piano chords bring out a previously unheard sadness in Kendrick’s scorching bars.

Some of the mashups just feel right like “DEVIL IN THE BACKSEAT” which lifts the fiery verse of “Backseat Freestyle” above the cinematic beat of “Devil In A New Dress.” Others like “DEAD POETS” which blends the triumphant verse of “All Of The Lights” with the soulful Janet Jackson sample from “Poetic Justice” are shockingly seamless.

Visuals

Toasty chose to blend good kid m.A.A.d city with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy because in many ways they are the two defining hip-hop albums of the 2010s. As someone who puts a lot of thought and energy into his visuals Toasty was also enthralled by good kid and Twisted Fantasy’s accompanying short films whose trippy imagery helped define each album’s tracklist.

“They’re two of my favorite albums ever” Toasty told Input. “Both came out at a time when I was getting really into making my own music so they definitely influenced how I thought an album should be put together.”

Another reason a Kendrick and Kanye mashup album excited Toasty was because the two legendary rappers haven’t worked together much in real life. “Generally Kendrick and Kanye have stayed in their own lanes maybe because they’re both such huge talents and would get in each other’s way” Toasty said. “It’s a dream collaboration.”

Drawn from only two albums GKTF is much more contained than Kanye 2049 which sampled various Kanye songs from across two decades. Restriction forced Toasty to get more creative finding ways to tie together songs with different keys tempos and vibes. Making GKTF was easier than past projects though because Toasty had already organized all his Kanye assets — samples stems and song data — for his last project.

Money is not what drives Toasty’s aspirations.

When making GKTF Toasty felt a lot of pressure to do good kid and Twisted Fantasy justice. As a diehard listener himself he knows how invested Kendrick and Kanye fans are in each artist’s music. Deconstructing good kid and Twisted Fantasy was like playing with fire. Since dropping Kanye 2049 Toasty has also built up a listenership of his own that he aims to please. He’s made a name for himself on Kanye-related subreddits like r/WestSubEver and r/Yedits where he posts new mashups before they hit SoundCloud and YouTube.

Toasty who works a desk job during the day got into making Kanye mashups out of pure fandom. Because of copyright issues he can’t directly monetize his remixes. Simply put he does it because he loves it. “It’s incredible to me that people even know the Toasty name” he said. “I feel like I have the community behind me now.”

Self-taught

With admittedly zero musical training Toasty is fully self-taught on GarageBand and Logic Pro. He keeps an arsenal of Kanye stems and samples and creates his mashups through lots of trial and error. His interactive mashup albums are like a diehard Kanye fan’s wildest dreams come to life.

“Kanye could either respond really well to it and think it’s the funniest coolest thing ever… or he could be extremely pissed”

And when the pandemic ends and clubs reopen Toasty hopes to take his operation live. He’s been practicing on an MPC he bought last year teaching himself how to use drum pads to rebuild his songs from scratch in real time. Until then his work as a mashup artist remains a side hustle supported by his Patreon.

In the next few months Toasty plans to work with web developer Starfennec on a companion website for GKTF similar to the interactive site they created for Kanye 2049. He’s also midway through another major project — an invented collaboration between Kanye and Frank Ocean — to be released sometime later this year.

Explicit Art

Toasty’s biggest goal is for his music to reach more people especially those who he is sampling. As far as he knows nobody from Kanye’s team has heard his work but with the help of internet virality that could change quite quickly. “It’d be really cool for Good Kid Twisted Fantasy to reach Kendrick” Toasty said. “Kanye could either respond really well to it and think it’s the funniest coolest thing ever… or he could be extremely pissed and get his lawyers involved.”

Whatever happens money is not what drives Toasty’s aspirations. While many Kanye fans have attempted to make remixes no one else has designed immersive universes around them. By inventing new songs by his favorite artists Toasty is essentially creating musical fan fiction a new multimedia form complete with bizarre origin stories dope visuals and astonishing mashups.

Just as Kanye paved the way for a generation of rappers Toasty is also changing the game pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a fan and an artist in his own right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY25ldHdvcmsubmV0L3Byb2R1Y3QtcmV2aWV3cy93ZF9ibGFjay01MDBnYi1zbjg1MC1wY2llLTQtMC1udm1lLXNzZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western Digital WD_Black 500GB SN850 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD (Review),"When NVMe entered the scene it changed storage like never before. A leap in transfer speeds greater than ever. Showing that we still have hope at achieving that technological utopia of tech we all dream of within this lifetime. Then comes PCIe 4.0 and with it even better NVMe performance. The WD_Black 500GB SN850 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is one of these new-gen NVMe options.

How do you make something that is already incredible and make it better? Double the incredibleness! Companies have indeed done just that with the PCIe 4.0 NVMe drives. Transfer speeds of up to 7000 MBps show that we are ready to push technology to its limits without having to worry about capacity bottlenecking the process.

Assuming you have the motherboard to take advantage of it of course. These drives will require a newer motherboard that offers PCIe 4.0. Without that you will get the same speeds as the previous-gen models. Thankfully this year buying into a new system can potentially gain you multiple leaps into next-gen tech (PCIe 4.0 Thunderbolt 4/USB4 and you will likely start to see DDR5 roll out by the end of the year).

Western Digital has shown that it’s still one of the top brands out there with its WD_Black products. Given the price tag on some of these can cause your heart to skip a beat or two. When it comes to NVMe high-performance means a price that will have to be paid. This has always been the case for any tech but NVMe is a special kind of inflation due to the amount of R&D that needs to be compensated for.

Thankfully you can still get your hands on the 500GB model for a relatively decent price tag when you consider the performance it yields. The price grows quickly from there though. The WD_Black line is available in the following options.

500GB — $149.99 (MSRP) – 7000 MBps (Read)/ 4100 MBps (Write)

— $149.99 (MSRP) – 7000 MBps (Read)/ 4100 MBps (Write) 1TB — $229.99 (MSRP) – 7000 MBps (Read)/ 5300 MBps (Write)

— $229.99 (MSRP) – 7000 MBps (Read)/ 5300 MBps (Write) 2TB — $449.99 (MSRP) – 7000 MBps (Read)/ 5100 MBps (Write)

The model we have been tested out is the 500GB model and due to the promise of performance it has to offer the first thing we did was put it neck to neck with some of the Samsung options out there that have always hovered the tops of our charts as a reigning champion.

Looking at the results of our comparisons I’d normally say that we were a bit surprised but this isn’t the case since the WD_Black series has continuously proven quite successful. So in this scenario the drive performed neck-to-neck with the Samsung options including Samsung’s latest 980 Pro. In some cases falling slightly behind the 980 Pro in performance and in some cases sliding gently past it.

This is exciting to see such a product from WD showing they are still proudly in the game and running with the best.

We had fun testing it out in various scenarios including “older” (PCIe 3.0) systems and USB 3.1/3.2 or TB3 connections using an enclosure. The drive almost always maxed out these connections instantly only wavering due to other bottlenecks of each given system (ie resources the other drives involved etc).

There are some caveats that come with any drive of this kind of performance. Heat is one of these. You will want to make sure your motherboard has a heatsink solution for the M.2 slots. If not then buy into the heatsink version of this drive. As long as you are rocking a heatsink that is doing its job your temps will be fine. However without a heatsink this could get quite hot. So in order to preserve the lifespan of the drive keep it cool by spreading that heat away.

WD has its Dashboard software (Windows OS environments only) that gives you a very complete picture of drive performance stats tools and settings. You can easily update the drive’s firmware or control the RGB settings (if you bought the model that comes with the RGB heatsink). We actually found that this is one of our favorite dashboard applications for SSDs thus far. Samsung’s is nice but WD really went above and beyond designing this one out.

Update 07/2021: The SN850 series have been labeled as PS5-compatible for expanding storage on the PlayStation 5 console.

Our Conclusion

The WD_Black SN850 series is a formidable opponent in the market competing with the best of the best. It would make an amazing OS drive and it would make an even better game drive if you are looking to compete against the latest consoles. Now if only we can break barriers/physics (today) with CPUs like we can NVMe drives.

Even better they have already been hitting sale pricing allowing you to pick one up at a more competitive price. At the time of this story some of the buttons below will yield prices as low as $119.99 making for a great deal.

The participation of Black workers in the US private-sector economy

Race in the workplace The Black experience in the US private sector (71 pages)

In the United States Black workers account for 15 million or 12 percent of the 125 million US private-sector workers. The overall Black labor force including the entire private sector public sector and the unemployed looking for work is 20.6 million. Our analysis of economic data primarily drawn from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Census Bureau from 2019 as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 2018 reinforces the immense complexity of the challenge facing many of the Black private-sector workers today.

The concentration of the Black labor force by geography industry and occupation creates challenges and mismatches

Overall our analysis found that Black workers are underrepresented in the highest-growth geographies and the highest-paying industries. Meanwhile they are overrepresented in low-growth geographies and in frontline jobs which tend to pay less.

1

The Black labor force is concentrated in states in the South

Almost 60 percent of the Black labor force (11.8 million people) is concentrated in the South compared with just one-third of the rest of private-sector workers (Exhibit 1). As a result companies located in states with low Black populations—for example much of the West and parts of the Midwest and Northeast—will need to think differently about how they effectively attract Black talent (Exhibit 2).

2

The Black labor force is not located in the fastest-growing regions

Author insights “A leader should be asking: ‘Given my geography my industry my location what are the best ways to make pathways for my Black frontline workers?’”

—Bryan Hancock partner McKinsey & Company



Overall Black workers are not located in the places where current job opportunities are and where job growth will likely rise the fastest through 2030. For example fewer than one in ten Black workers is located in the fastest-growing cities and counties (such as Provo Utah). Instead they overwhelmingly live in places where job growth will range from low to above average with the bright spots being in megacities (such as Chicago) and urban periphery (such as Clayton County Georgia). For the growth to be inclusive in these areas workers need to be connected to the opportunities being created (for example transportation between Black neighborhoods and job locations) and have the right skills for in-demand jobs.

Almost half of Black workers are in three industries with a large frontline presence with significant underrepresentation especially in high-growth high-wage industries

Our analysis found that 45 percent of Black private-sector workers (approximately 6.7 million people) work in three industries that have a large frontline-service presence: healthcare retail and accommodation and food service. These industries also have some of the highest shares of workers making less than $30000 (Exhibit 3). In retail 73 percent of Black workers fall into this category; in accommodations and food service that share is 84 percent.

Conversely Black workers are underrepresented in industries such as information technology professional services and financial services—all sectors that typically have relatively higher wages and job growth.

More Black workers are in jobs with less opportunity for advancement

More Black private-sector workers 43 percent make less than $30000 per year compared with 29 percent of the rest of private-sector employees (Exhibit 4). In addition Black workers tend to be in the industries with the largest frontline labor forces. Three in five Black workers work in frontline jobs such as service workers laborers operatives and office and clerical workers.

Black workers are at higher risk of disruption from automation

Automation will prove disruptive to the labor force in the years to come but its impact won’t be evenly distributed. For example one-third of Black workers are in occupational groups such as production work food service and office support which are at heightened risk of losing their jobs to automation. One encouraging trend: health aides is the occupational group with the highest expected job growth through 2030 and these occupations are disproportionately filled by Black workers.

Job prospects are markedly different for Black and white workers with similar backgrounds

Black workers face higher hurdles to gainful employment than do the rest of the labor force creating stark disparities. For example the employment rate for Black workers with some college or an associate’s degree are similar to the total population of workers who have a high-school diploma.

The Black experience in the workplace: Findings from participating companies

Our research drew on data from 24 participating companies ranging in size from 10000 to 1.4 million US employees and across all geographies representing a total of about 3.7 million US employees. Several key insights emerged:

Black employees encounter representation gaps at each step

According to our analysis companies have successfully hired Black employees into frontline and entry-level jobs but there is a significant drop-off in representation at management levels. In the report’s participating companies Black employees make up 14 percent of all employees compared with 12 percent for the US private sector overall. At the managerial level the Black share of the workforce declines to 7 percent. Across the senior manager VP and SVP levels Black representation holds steady at 4 to 5 percent (Exhibit 5).

5

Black employees face five common challenges in the private sector

Based on findings from the participating companies Black employees face five common challenges that materially affect Black representation advancement and experience:

Frontline jobs largely do not connect Black employees with sufficient opportunities to advance. Our data set of participating companies shows that Black employees are overrepresented in frontline jobs (18 percent) compared with managerial jobs (9 percent). Frontline jobs could be a launching pad for careers but today there is just one frontline salaried position for every 20 frontline hourly jobs reinforcing the need for pathways within and across industries.

Entry-level jobs are a revolving door and Black employee attrition is high. Black employees make up 12 percent of entry-level employees (such as account associates software engineers and paralegals). While hiring has been effective the higher attrition of Black employees—they are leaving their jobs more often than their white counterparts at almost all levels—reduces the number of Black candidates available for promotion.

Black employees encounter a broken rung from entry-level jobs to managerial jobs. Black employees account for just 7 percent of managers. This broken rung and higher-than-expected attrition rates in the pipeline significantly limit representation at subsequent levels of the company. For Black employees who are able to make it to the manager level we see some promising signs in promotion rates for these employees.

A trust deficit exists between Black employees and their companies. A trust deficit reflects Black employee perceptions of their workplace as less fair accepting and authentic. For example Black employees are 23 percent less likely to receive “a lot” or “quite a bit” of support to advance 41 percent less likely to view promotions as fair and 39 percent less likely to believe their company’s DE&I programs are effective than white employees in the same company.

Black employees lack the sponsorship and allyship to support their advancement. Most Black employees are ambitious and want to advance but perceive a lack of support to help them ascend to management jobs. Only 23 percent of Black employees and 30 percent of white employees believe they get “a lot” or “quite a bit” of support to advance. More than 67 percent of Black employees and 63 percent of white employees report they do not have a sponsor despite 87 percent of our participating companies reporting that they have sponsorship programs in place.

Variability in representation across companies

Variability in representation among the companies in our participating company data set suggests reasons to be optimistic. Although no company has solved the challenge of increasing Black representation at all job levels many have made significant inroads at specific points in the pipeline. Their successes could hold the key to more favorable outcomes across the private sector.

A path forward

On the current trajectory it will take about 95 years for Black employees to reach talent parity (or 12 percent representation) across all levels in the private sector. Addressing the major barriers that hold back the advancement of Black employees could cut that duration to about 25 years.

Achieving equity for Black workers in the private sector is a structural and multivariate challenge that cuts across many facets of geography industry and occupations as well as advancement and inclusion in the workplace.

Companies and other stakeholders will need to address ten key challenges to create opportunities

Truly making progress will require more than addressing corporate policies; it calls for system-level change an examination of our broader society and active collaboration among companies and other stakeholders.

While the challenges are daunting our research found some bright spots that companies can build on. Trends for both Black representation in the private sector and the promotion rates for Black men and women have shown improvement. High representation in faster-growing and higher-paying industries for Black workers such as transportation could present opportunities in the coming years. Nine in ten Black employees believe they are helping their company succeed and that their work gives them a sense of purpose and accomplishment. In addition our research uncovered pockets of progress on DE&I programs and representation in different companies which provides the potential for shared learning of best practices across companies.

Companies can take a number of actions immediately to address their own workforce and culture. Our research as well as findings by others suggest the following no-regrets moves.

Define your company’s aspiration for addressing racial equity—including steps to address structural barriers

Understand your company’s current state of DE&I taking into account industry and geographic contexts

Strategically prioritize interventions

Reinforce what works—and reimagine what doesn’t

Track progress to increase accountability—and share successes

Beyond actions by individual companies a more concerted effort may be required. Companies should consider the following efforts to build broader momentum for effecting system-level change.

Share best practices on effective programs

Pursue collaborative efforts to galvanize collective action

Commit to continued investment and research

Author insights “Black employees are seeing companies saying the right things making public announcements and monetary commitments to diversity equity and inclusion but the execution is lacking.”

—Monne Williams partner McKinsey & Company

The Racial Equity Institute writes “Our systems institutions and outcomes emanate from the racial hierarchy on which the United States was built. In other words we have a ‘groundwater’ problem and we need ‘groundwater’ solutions.”

Companies have an important role to play—along with other stakeholders. It is our hope that this paper helps to inform the conversation on the path forward. We plan to continue to contribute and be part of this journey.

Speaker Challenges Williams College's Racist Legacy in Keynote to Daylong Dialogue

WILLIAMSTOWN Mass. — A keynote speaker for Williams College's annual Claiming Williams day challenged the school to confront its racial history acknowledge its racist present and work toward an antiracist future.

Black queer femme activist Erika Hart an adjunct faculty member at Pennsylvania's Widener University addressed the college community and the public in an hourlong forum at the center of the college's full day of discussions and workshops with the theme ""From Racial Injustice to Restoration.""

Hart educated her audience about the roots of racism in society and the ways in which the college's own history is rooted in imperialism and white supremacy.

At one point Hart pointed to the college's statements in the wake of the killing of George Floyd last May but said those statements like many others nationwide ultimately ring hollow.

""Williams made a statement and said they were going to give money to various places that they were going to give students money so they can continue to study racial justice"" Hart said. ""But the school is named after Williams a slaveowner. And when I was reading about your school and saw that your mascot is the Ephs I was like 'What in the world is an Eph?' Literally it's named after Ephraim [Williams].

""Why is it that all this money $500000 is what was on your website all this money is being thrown to all these different places when changing the name which is incredibly triggering for the 7 percent of Black people who attend Williams College incredibly triggering to be at a school whose namesake is a slave owner and also the mascot … I was very perplexed why those changes weren't made and what exactly is the school going to do to make those changes.

""Is the school still committed to this legacy of a slave owner? These are questions we want to be engaging in.""

Williams' racist roots run deeper than the name and the mascot Hart said. The college's third president Edward Door Griffin who led the school from 1821-36 also was a slave owner and encouraged students to donate to the American Colonization Society which was dedicated to shipping Black people held in bondage in the U.S. back to Africa — not for the benefit of slaves but for the protection of a white population that feared slave uprisings.

""I know a lot of colleges [including Williams] had white students interested in abolition"" Hart said. ""But a lot of that was really tongue in cheek because no Black students were able to go to the schools. Indigenous people had been eradicated at this time. You have to be mindful that abolition meant very little while chattel slavery was occurring.""

Moving forward into more contemporary times Hart noted the racist deed restrictions in a Williamstown neighborhood that were put in place in the 1930s and which just last year a group of current residents banded together to address. And she mentioned a 2018 campus protest after faculty members of color resigned ""due to racism happening at Williams.""

""I was reading some of the comments of white students at Williams denying that Black students were experiencing [racism] and I want folks to understand that the history at Williams is very much steeped into the walls into the floors into the floorboards into the books into the faculty into the president into the trustees"" Hart said. ""Most of the trustees of Williams College to the surprise of no one are white. All of these things will contribute to a horrible experience that many Black students are having at Williams.""

In 2008 a student group called Stand With Us created Claiming Williams day which is celebrated on the first Thursday of each spring semester to have a ""day of programming that confronts and critiques systems and practices of exclusion at Williams and beyond.""

Thursday's activities ran from 9:15 a.m. through the day's second keynote speaker legal scholar Michelle Alexander who was scheduled to speak at 7:30 p.m.

Hart and Alexander's talks were among a handful out of nearly 20 events that were open to the general public. Another ""Town Gown and Police Accountability: Civic engagement in Williamstown"" was scheduled for mid-afternoon on Thursday. All the public events will be available for replay on the town's community access television station WilliNet

Hart's talk was mostly focused on the college but frequently addressed and challenged its wider audience particularly those who deny the enduring oppression of racism in society and academia.

""If you came here hoping to get a lot of evidence for how racism or white supremacy still exists I invite you to consider why you need a lot of evidence for it considering we are in a country that is founded on white supremacy"" Hart said. ""If you are someone who has demanded a lot of evidence from communities of color for what you have experienced I invite you to question why you need a lot of evidence to then take action.

""I can give you lots of examples of the ways quantitative research has failed. But one example I'll give you is a heart-breaking story about Laquan McDonald who was murdered in Chicago by a white police officer who had over 100 complaints against him about racism. So the next time you think 'We just need a lot of information about this or a lot of data … and then we can take action' consider that that has a lot to do with silencing Black people and our concerns.""

Hart disputed the notion of a ""post-racial"" America and said talk of color blindness in society was another form of privilege for white Americans who ""get to exist in a way that is unraced.""

Hart used multimedia to drive home the point playing an extended clip from an 1993 interview given by novelist Toni Morrison.

""[Don't] you understand that the people who do this thing who practice racism are bereft"" Morrison said. ""There is something distorted about the psyche. It's a huge waste and it's a corruption and a distortion. It's like it's a profound neurosis that nobody examines for what it is. It feels crazy. It is crazy and it leaves — it has just as much of a deleterious effect on white people and possibly equal that it does black people. I always knew that I had the moral high ground.""

Hart called on white listeners to go beyond simply acknowledging their privilege and advocate for reparations for crimes committed against Black and indigenous peoples.

She opened by talking about the ""land acknowledgements"" that communities and institutions have begun to use to recognize the atrocities committed against indigenous people like the Mahicans who were the first settlers of the land that Williams College and Williamstown now occupy. Hart said there are not enough of those acknowledgements and that the acknowledgements themselves don't go far enough.

""Let's say Kailyn stole some of my records"" Hart said referring to Kailyn Gibson the talk's student moderator and the record collection in the backdrop of Hart's Zoom screen. ""And the next time she introduced a speaker she said I just want to acknowledge that I stole some of Erika's records. And she even said she was going to put that on her website.

""That wouldn't make a difference right? I'm going to need you to do a little more meaning I'm going to need you to give them back. The Mahican people … want their land back.""

Bringing the issue back to academia an attendee asked during a brief Q&A whether there are good examples Williams can follow of colleges and universities that are practicing restorative justice.

""No"" Hart said. ""Williams needs to be the model. There has been no institution that has done that work. Williams is going to have to be the model. The pressure is on Williams."""
WTW,Willis Towers Watson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2RhaWx5LmNvbS5hdS9maW5hbmNlL3N1cGVyYW5udWF0aW9uLzIwMjEvMDIvMjEvYXVzdHJhbGlhLXBlbnNpb24tc3VwZXItd29ybGQtYmVhdGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia has the world's most successful pension system study finds,"Australia is the world’s most successful pension market with assets under management increasing by 11.3 per cent a year over the 20 years to 2020 according to the latest Global Pension Assets study conducted by risk advisers Willis Towers Watson.

But before you plan an early retirement that figure does not mean your fund will have averaged a return of 11.3 per cent over 20 years.

What it means is the total funds under management in our superannuation system increased by that amount – a figure that includes fund returns and rising contribution levels made by a growing workforce.

WTW’s pension think tank Thinking Ahead Institute explained Australia’s super success this way: “The critical features in this success have been government-mandated pension contributions a competitive institutional model and the dominance of DC [defined contribution].”

In other words the system has grown for three reasons.

Find out – How super funds performed in February

Firstly it has grown because the federal government requires all employers to contribute a rising amount of money into their workers’ pensions.

This amount is currently set at 9.5 per cent of workers’ wages but is scheduled to rise to 12 per cent by mid-2025.

Secondly because workers can choose their funds all funds compete for contributions and have a strong incentive to perform highly.

And thirdly Australian super is overwhelmingly based on defined contributions not defined benefits.

Because the latter promises a given retirement amount funds using this model have to be very conservative and invest heavily in bonds to ensure they have the revenues to pay pensions regardless of what’s happening in financial markets.

Bonds are not a growth asset like shares and property so a defined benefit system grows more slowly.

WTW’s research shows Australia’s super system gained a lot of clout during 2020 growing from 151 per cent of GDP to 175 per cent.

That performance impressed Jessica Melville investment strategy chief of Willis Towers Watson.

“Australia’s performance where assets rose to 175 per cent of GDP (up from 151 per cent the year before) was particularly impressive considering [there were] over $36 billion in outflows because of the early access to super scheme” Ms Melville said.

“While early release supported members in their time of need during the pandemic Australian funds have shown considerable resilience and they will continue to play a significant role in the nation’s recovery.”

Two factors explain the big increase in the industry’s size relative to the overall economy said Stephen Anthony chief economist at Industry Super Australia.

Dr Anthony said “overall GDP declined because of the pandemic so the relative position of super was stronger”.

And the extraordinary sharemarket recovery from the pandemic which has seen the average balanced superannuation account climb 18 per cent since April has also played a part he said.

The structure of Australia’s super system enabled funds to capitalise on this recovery as local funds are more exposed to shares than their international counterparts.

As the following chart shows Australia has 48 per cent of pension assets in equities compared to 44 per cent for Canada a country with a similar system to Australia’s and 47 per cent for the US.

Most other countries surveyed invested roughly 30 per cent of pension assets in equities (shares).

Another driver of Australia’s strong performance is the growing importance of alternative assets in the system which now account for 24 per cent of total assets.

“Bond rates have been falling for some time and the industry funds saw early that they could get bond-type returns from assets like infrastructure and property so they moved” Dr Anthony said.

Moving from fixed interest to infrastructure meant there were no income cuts as bond rates fell.

In fact the value of the alternative assets increased because their returns were more highly valued by investors.

The growing size of super in the economy is positive and boosting investment in infrastructure said Nicki Hutley partner with Deloitte Access Economics.

“Some countries like the US notionally save for retirement through the government. But it is spent on other things and some of their pension systems are completely underfunded” Ms Hutley told The New Daily.

“If you are investing large amounts into the superannuation system the main thing is that you have confidence in the system which we do.

“If you invest through the private sector it is generally more efficient than if done through the government and in our system there is a lot of scrutiny.

“If people saved for themselves instead of through superannuation it could be spent on consumption rather than invested. So you could argue that we have a lot more investment in things like infrastructure because of superannuation.”

Australia has had the strongest growth rate in pension assets among comparable countries over the past 10 years with assets growing at an average annual rate of 8.7 per cent.

The US Italy and Ireland followed with 7.9 per cent 7.8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.

Their companies also visited the campus and hired students for different internship opportunities. The Career Development Centre the Placement Cell of Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies helps to grow the ongoing students of the college. It also provides internship and placement opportunities to the alumni. However the gross package of Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies crossed 7 crores.

WHEN IS THE SECOND PHASE OF SSCBS PLACEMENT SESSION?

So the college has just completed its first phase of the SSCBS placement session. The second phase is yet to begin. Students from outside the campus can also be a part of the placement session. They can mail it to the placement cell or they can connect with them through social media. So other students can also avail many placement and internship opportunities.",,,,,,,,,

Some betting Las Vegas could take esports to new level post-pandemic

Esports boomed online over the past year. It’s unclear whether that success continues in a post-pandemic world but experts see renewed possibility for Las Vegas to take esports to the next level.

“Vegas could become the esports capital of North America” said Milo Ocampo the founder of Las Vegas-based 8-Bit Esports. The 26-year-old Ocampo AKA “kuyamilo” said he first realized Las Vegas’ potential in 2013. “We have the infrastructure set for it in terms of the convention space the tech is here. And the legacy is essentially here.”

Ante: upped

There’s a coin flip’s chance that you’ve played a video game since March.

About 55 percent of U.S. residents played video games during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to a recently released report by Nielsen subsidiary SuperData. The same report found that the games and interactive media industry grew 12 percent year-over-year to a $139.9 billion powerhouse in 2020. Streaming reached 1.2 billion people in 2020 and generated $9.3 billion in revenue.

Esports was a booming industry worldwide prior to the pandemic. People spent more than a billion hours watching online streaming platform Twitch in both February and March of 2020 according to data provided by Rainmaker.gg gaming metrics. That number jumped to 1.6 billion in April.

Then the pandemic hit and people were stuck at home those first few months looking for something to do.

No concerts bars shows live sports.

The lack of competitive entertainment provided esports a window to gain new attention especially as traditional sports leagues and athletes began transitioning their own competitions online according to Brett Abarbanel director of research at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute.

“This just upped the ante and moved everything forward probably about five years just in terms of how it might normally have moved up the trajectory” she said.

Esports reached a wider audience as people sought options for entertainment online. That hasn’t changed with the return of live sports but its growth pattern has slowed as the U.S. approaches a year of pandemic life.

“That incredible trajectory was not sustainable. It couldn’t just go through the roof forever. Nothing really can” Abarbanel said. “But we’re still seeing impressive growth and some plateauing.”

Nevertheless that growth has excited Jud Hannigan the CEO of Allied Esports. His company owns the HyperX Esports Arena on the Strip which resumed hosting in-person events June 25 and now holds three or four tournaments per week.

Since the pandemic the arena has expanded into daily and longer online tournaments to reach a wider audience. Viewership is up 1000 percent from pre-pandemic levels for some of the arena’s online content Hannigan said. The company can now pair its online offerings with in-person events something he sees as a potent combination.

“I think in a post-pandemic world we’ll start to see people flying in regularly for our events” he said “and it’s super exciting for us because we weren’t necessarily there pre-pandemic and now we are.”

Hannigan said the arena’s spring closure provided an opportunity to re-evaluate its offerings. Allied Esports views elevating player profiles as central to its business model. Accordingly the company converted a domed space between the lobby and the arena into a “champion’s circle” complete with a 360-degree LED wall highlighting past and current champions wins and stats.

“If they haven’t come during the pandemic once people come back they’re gonna feel that love” Hannigan said. “And I think they’re gonna feel that that experience is only greater.”

‘This is gonna happen’

There’s a sense of unmet potential for esports in Las Vegas.

Hotels. Casinos. Arenas. Shows. Entertainment. Bars. Nightlife. Experts say the infrastructure is all there for an esports tourist destination.

Yet hotel-casinos such as The Linq and Downtown Grand tried cashing in on an expected esports boom a few years ago and have since scaled back. The HyperX arena’s average customer is 16 five years away from enjoying the 21-and-over kind of gaming that drives Nevada’s economy. They may not be old enough to gamble or drink just yet but they will be soon enough said Chris LaPorte founder of Reset Las Vegas a video gaming consulting company.

“(Las Vegas) jumped into this somewhat early on” Abarbanel said in April. “It’s not that esports is not a success story it’s more that esports is not a success story yet. It’s taking more time to develop what’s right for this city.”

Esports are still a new concept she said last month. League of Legends one of the world’s most popular competitive games debuted in 2009. The industry is still trying to figure out what it is. So are the players let alone the businesses hoping to get in the game for the first time she said.

The industry’s nascency does have “upside” for Las Vegas Abarbanel added. There’s room for innovation and definition in a city with plenty of innovators event space and interest in esports. She pointed to the rapid development of the city into a traditional sports hub.

“In a similar manner we might be able to play host to a major esports event or attract a game developer to set up its headquarters in Las Vegas” she said. “We have a lot of opportunity to be a major hub for streamers who want to set up shop we can innovate in that space as well we can have those sorts of talent agencies.”

Esports in Las Vegas “can become something that does grow quite quickly” because groups like the Nevada Esports Alliance never gave up on the possibility said LaPorte also one of the nonprofit’s members. Online tournaments during the pandemic have at times struggled with bad internet connections and cheating scandals he said.

The demand for large live events is real he said and makes venues like the HyperX arena all-the-more attractive.

“We’re still here saying ‘Hey look trust us. This is gonna happen’” LaPorte said. “We have to just figure out what is going to make it work and how to probably align everyone’s needs to ensure that esports is looking at Las Vegas as a place to hold events.”

Las Vegas hasn’t solved that puzzle — yet.

Bet on potential

Nevada’s public and private leaders see renewed opportunity for local esports to reach the next level.

They’ve viewed the industry in recent years as a way to attract a new generation of customers and diversify and fortify Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy.

A Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority spokeswoman said pent-up demand for in-person events will benefit the valley’s venues that host competitions and conferences. The visitors authority is a founding member of the esports alliance.

Video gaming has thrived during the pandemic and esports’ popularity has provided great opportunity for the valley spokeswoman Lori Nelson-Kraft said.

“Esports fans have shown great enthusiasm for events held in Las Vegas with our 24/7 action and robust entertainment offerings” she said. “The esports industry also allows Las Vegas to attract both leisure and business travelers as we can host tournaments as well as (business-to-business) conferences.”

Nevada Sen. Ben Kieckhefer (R-Reno) is drafting legislation that would create what’s thought to be the country’s first government regulating body for esports.

He envisions a “light touch” state oversight group akin to the Nevada Athletic Commission which regulates combat sports like mixed martial arts and boxing through licensure and sanctions.

Kieckhefer said Nevada has the opportunity to support its most important industries gaming and hospitality and establish itself as a global leader in esports.

“I think the general consensus now is that the time has come for something like this” he said.

The long view

Caesars Entertainment Inc. sees signs that esports events will return and is “involved in a number of conversations at present about exciting new events” said Ty Stewart senior vice president of World Series of Poker and esports.

Stewart said the company believes in esports and thinks Las Vegas “can and will be the de facto home” for esports competitions and festivals.

Esports wagering offers substantial opportunity Stewart said. Caesars is excited about new ways to apply gaming to esports “beyond the traditional outcome markets particularly peer-to-peer gaming on popular titles and streamer betting with instantly served proposition bets.”

“It’s a long regulatory road and most states are focused on sports betting when it comes to iGaming presently but the potential is significant” he said.

Nevada currently considers esports wagers as event betting like wagering on the Olympics rather than sports betting for the NFL said UNLV’s Abarbanel also a director with the esports alliance. Esports betting today requires an application and review process for each event before someone can place a bet she said. The Nevada Gaming Control Board has approved betting on several esports competitions over the past year.

The valley’s inherent advantages as a tourist destination and an “expedited — or overhauled — approval process” could create a unique esports experience according to Chris Grove an analyst with California-based gaming research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

“Everything I see leads me to believe that gambling will play a major role in the growth and development of esports” he said.

Spokespeople for Las Vegas Sands Corp. Red Rock Resorts and MGM Resorts International declined to comment. Spokespeople for Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Boyd Gaming Corp. didn’t return requests for comment.

‘That’s the strength of Vegas’

It will take buy-in for Las Vegas to reach its potential as an esports destination experts say.

Grove said the U.S. is large enough to have several esports hubs each attracting slightly different audiences. Las Vegas’ key will be consistency.

“As Vegas hosts more successful events the city is likely to continue to earn a reputation in the esports community” he said. “Vegas is an amazing backdrop for all sorts of events and that’s the strength of Vegas.”

One hurdle he notes is casinos aren’t necessarily designed for a younger gaming crowd. Esports events must be planned “holistically.”

A generational gap exists between the hospitality industry’s decisionmakers and esports experts said Jairo Urcuyo founder and CEO of esports organization Las Vegas Inferno. A hotel-casino simply throwing a tournament each week isn’t going to cut it; proper marketing and concerted effort to reach a new audience are necessary.

“You’re not marketing towards your regular people who come to the casino and play slots or play poker” Urcuyo said. “You’re not catering to that generation. They’ve got to understand that they’re catering to the new generation that’s up and coming. And a lot of casinos don’t understand that.”

Urcuyo and others highlight an “authenticity” problem that is hard to define but gamers know it when they see it. They bristle at perceived pandering and are skeptical of those who want their business but don’t share their passion he said.

LaPorte with the esports alliance said esports athletes are celebrities with legions of fans comparable to LeBron James in the NBA. Las Vegas already caters to a celebrity culture he said and city promoters must lean into “nerd culture” and attract popular gamers to town; their fans will follow.

“The subscribers to a popular celebrity on Twitch are rabid fans” said Robert Rippee director of the Hospitality Lab at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute. “They consume every word the actions they’re highly engaged.”

“And that is a lesson for everybody on loyalty. If we can achieve that kind of loyalty oh my gosh it’s game over for anything else.”

In California and across the southwest a scorching heat wave six months ago contributed to an overstressed grid that knocked out the power supply for millions leaving them without air conditioning as temperatures soared into the triple digits.

Nevada is not Texas nor is it California. The state avoided rolling blackouts during the August 2020 heatwave (though NV Energy still issued a rare voluntary request for customers to curtail power use during times of peak demand) and hasn’t seen similar severe winter weather that knocked out many grid operations in Texas last week.

But 2020 wasn’t an anomaly. Issues of grid management and resource adequacy — having enough power to meet demand the same issue that befell California last year and Texas this year — aren’t going away anytime soon. The future for the planet is an increase in extreme weather events and Nevada is in the bullseye of states most likely to experience massive temperature swings and the full effects of climate change.

Over the past six months NV Energy officials have been answering questions about the August near-crisis through an investigatory docket opened by regulators at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission focusing on both what exactly drove the utility to request customers curtail power use on Aug. 18 and 19 but also on broader issues of resource adequacy and how best to avoid a California or Texas-style grid disruption.

The electric utility company has also taken steps to prepare for next summer beyond answering those questions. In late December 2020 it filed an amendment to its Energy Supply Plan that proposes to spend an additional $61.3 million to help prepare for an expected hot summer and additional demand in 2021.

The dollars will help fund projects or infrastructure developments aimed at increasing capacity during hot summer months budgeting for a hotter-than-normal summer in internal supply planning and raising the required reserve percentage to help with any temperature variances or unexpected increases in demand.

But that additional spending will still leave the utility continuing to rely on open market purchases to meet expected demand — around 900 megawatts per month between June and August 2021. (A megawatt represents enough power for several hundred residential homes though exact figures vary on source of energy and average residential electrical use).

But that reliance on market purchases to meet expected demand for next summer could be a potential cause for concern: PUC staffers wrote in an investigatory docket that they were concerned a similar seasonal heat wave and subsequent curtailment of open market power in 2021 “may not be a plan for success.”

The investigatory docket also revealed another stress factor on the grid: unexpected load demand from large casinos and businesses that previously filed to leave utility service but whose alternative electric providers faced the same constraints on electric power and were unable to deliver the promised load leaving NV Energy to fill in the gaps.

And while NV Energy has invested in expanded large-scale battery storage technology its move to adopt higher standards of renewable energy over the next decade will also add stress to the grid because of the simple fact that solar energy is intermittent.

Dealing with that combination of factors is a problem that the PUC NV Energy and other interested parties will likely deal with in future utility planning filings and will be affected by NV Energy’s moves to sizably increase its reliance on renewable energy and a proposed major billion-dollar transmission upgrade.

Dylan Sullivan a senior scientist for the National Resource Defense Council said that smart grid management planning would avoid any potential or perceived conflict between an increased reliance on renewable energy and the reliability of the state’s power supply.

“Sometimes it's presented as we have to make a choice between renewables and reliability” Sullivan said. “We really don't have to make a choice if we plan. We can have an affordable reliable and highly renewable energy system but we do have to plan for it we do have to look at what happens when a bunch of things go wrong.”

Open positions and limits on the market

There are three ways that NV Energy creates or obtains electrons that power homes and businesses throughout the state.

The utility company owns a group of about a dozen generating stations (26 actual generating units) — largely natural gas-powered but with some solar projects in southern Nevada and the coal-fired Valmy power plant near Battle Mountain.

NV Energy also contracts with about 43 generating projects through Power Purchase Agreements which are long-term contracts with private-party developers to build and generate a certain amount of electricity for the utility company. Many of NV Energy’s recent investments into large-scale solar projects have come through these agreements also known as PPAs.

But to meet demand requirements especially during summer months where normal capacity isn’t enough to meet the heightened demand NV Energy (and other utilities) rely on market purchases of electricity to fill those gaps.

Market purchases fall into three categories: real-time day-ahead and term. Term refers to open market purchases that are typically negotiated months in advance while real-time and day-ahead are what they sound like closer to real-time needs. NV Energy said in PUC filings that it prefers “firm energy products” which means there is a commitment placed on the seller of the electricity products to deliver the goods.

Resource planning isn’t like horseshoes or hand grenades; getting close but falling short of meeting actual demand means serious system reliability issues and blackouts. That’s why the utility overshoots its expected demand with a planned reserve margin over expected demand which last summer was around 13 percent system-wide.

NV Energy plans resource adequacy in a few ways. It’s required by law to file an “Energy Supply Plan” which is the utility’s strategy and estimates of how much electricity it will need to procure for customers and how it plans to obtain that electricity. The last Energy Supply Plan was approved in November 2019 but the utility regularly files amendments to the plan.

The utility also uses a seasonal “laddering” approach for market purchases meaning it discusses and makes further adjustments to planned market purchases every quarter based on more timely weather forecasts and other more up-to-date market conditions.

A near-disaster in August

That normal strategy of relying on open market purchases to fill the gap between supply and demand almost failed during the week of Aug. 17.

A blistering record-setting heat wave blanketed the Southwest putting enough stress on the electric grid for California to implement rolling blackouts for the first time in two decades.

The heat wave and grid pressures didn't stop at state boundaries; Nevada saw similar scorching temperatures that week in August and similar pressures on the grid because of the above-average temperatures and smoke from California wildfires.

NV Energy took many steps to try and lower electric demand: the request for voluntary lower power use asking large customers to cut electric use asking large independently owned power generators within the state to help address the demand and issuing a “no touch” order on generation equipment to avoid any inadvertent interruptions.

But the state’s electric market came close to the precipice of disaster. NV Energy reported in the PUC investigatory docket that it reached the third and highest level of an Energy Emergency Alert (utility parlance for power blackouts) for several hours on the afternoon of Aug. 18.

During that afternoon at around 4 p.m. NV Energy fell short of its required operating reserves — the required contingency backup that the utility typically plans for. Twelve minutes into that hour the company tapped into power provided by the Northwest Power Pool reserves — a grid oversight body covering power networks in eight states and two Canadian provinces.

Tapping into resources from the Northwest Power Pool was like cashing in an insurance policy — helpful to have in place for times of emergency but evidence that something went wrong. (Again no NV Energy customers residential or commercial experienced outages.)

In its filings NV Energy said that the issue wasn’t in company-owned generation or any of the (primarily solar) PPAs — all performed between 90 to 100 percent of expected capacity. The company also said there weren’t any transmission issues with moving electrons around the grid.

Instead the issue was with limitations on market purchases and curtailment — decisions by grid operators (largely in California) to stop the flow of electricity out of the area to ensure that adequate electricity is available in their service area.

During the week of Aug. 17 2020 NV Energy reported that there were 76 hours (an average of 11 a day) where market purchases were curtailed meaning the “actual delivered energy was less than the confirmed term day ahead or real time purchases.” The largest curtailment happened at 7 p.m. on Aug. 18 when 1243 megawatts of purchased open market power were curtailed; the company said “NV Energy has never experienced a curtailment of that size.” Many of the curtailments occurred in real time “with little to no notice.”

Between Aug. 17 and 23 NV Energy saw more than 7100 megawatts of purchased electricity curtailed. 72 percent of that curtailed energy were day-ahead or real-time purchases.

Those curtailments couldn’t have come at at a worse time. The above-average temperatures drove NV Energy and other power providers to rely on market purchases to keep lights on throughout the state driving the price of a megawatt hour to obscene levels.

Electricity that the week prior had cost around $70 per megawatt hour skyrocketed amid the incredible demand — hitting a real-time peak of around $2600 per megawatt hour on Aug. 18. That’s a more than 3600 percent increase or like a gallon of milk going from $2.99 one week to more than $100 a few days later.

704B issues

The docket identified another stress factor that affected the state’s grid during those hot August days — servicing many of the large businesses that had previously filed to leave utility service and work with providers on the open market.

These “704B” customers (named after the provision in state law) are some of the most well-known entities in the state: MGM Resorts Switch Wynn Resorts Caesars Entertainment Sahara Las Vegas and the Peppermill Resorts in Reno. Before state lawmakers in 2019 added new limits those companies would generally file an application and agree to pay a seven-to-eight figure “exit fee” in return for the right to buy power (presumably cheaper) on the open market.

But those businesses aren’t totally free of NV Energy. As the balancing authority or grid operator NV Energy still manages transmission for 704B customers meaning they’re obligated to provide balancing services and manage the flow of electricity for those customers. The utility also acts as a provider of last resort meaning that the customers pay a tariff (fee) to ensure that NV Energy will provide power if any of their normal providers had a disruption in service.

That’s exactly what happened in August. Four electric providers for 704B companies failed to fulfill their obligations to their customers on the afternoon of Aug. 18 leaving some of the state’s largest casino companies to once again lean on NV Energy to keep the lights on and power running.

The alternative power providers experienced varying levels of failure; Caesars’ shorted power supply from provider Tenaska never exceeded 10 percent while the Peppermill in Reno had to 100 percent rely on NV Energy power for several hours on Aug. 18.

In a filing staff for the PUC wrote that while NV Energy still provides electricity transmission service to 704B customers and is expected to make up imbalances in power supply the level of failure to provide power well exceeded any imbalance authority and instead worked essentially as a standby service.

“This creates a riskless paradigm under which certain NRS 704B customers shift supply risk and the obligation to NV Energy and its remaining customers with little risk to the NRS 704B customers” PUC staff attorney David Noble wrote in a filing.

Noble wrote that NV Energy was supposed to write-off the load of 704B customers once they left utility service but “clearly that is not the case” given what happened in August. He suggested that the PUC and NV Energy in future proceedings explore ways to charge 704B customers for what essentially worked as standby service.

“If NV Energy and remaining customers are going to have to backstop some or all of these departed customer loads when the market gets tight then NV Energy and remaining customers need to be compensated for that service and NV Energy needs to start planning for the possibility of such events in its ... filings” Noble wrote in the filing.

Tenaska and other alternative providers pushed back saying that the 704B customers already pay a fee for the transmission provider (NV Energy) to backfill load in the event of “system contingency.” They wrote that the system worked as intended and that 704B customers paid NV Energy for any electricity the utility had to provide.

During times of peak demand on Aug. 18 NV Energy was required to make up a shortfall that varied between 131 and 85 megawatts of power for transmission-only customers (the 704B companies). That amount of power diverted to those customers was smaller than the curtailment amount NV Energy was dealing with at the same time but the utility wrote that the two issues combined had exacerbated supply issues to the near-crisis level.

“If firm purchases had been delivered and transmission customers avoided leaning on NV Energy’s resources the shortfall would have largely been avoided” NV Energy executive Michael Greene wrote in a filing.

Planning for next summer

Even if NV Energy was to sit on its hands and not do anything to prepare for the 2021 summer past contracts for large-scale solar and battery resources are scheduled to be operational before summer strikes.

That includes 70 megawatts of solar energy at the Techren Solar Project near Boulder City a 50-megawatt solar plant earmarked for an Apple data facility and a 101-megawatt solar field and 25-megawatt battery storage facility near Battle Mountain.

But even with that expanded capacity NV Energy is still planning to rely on market purchases during summer months of 2021 to meet anticipated demand goals.

That is largely due to a change in energy supply planning for the remainder of 2021. The amended Energy Supply Plan filed in late December makes several changes including:

Implementing a “hot summer” weather scenario which estimates hotter temperatures in the summer and raises anticipated demand levels

Raising the utility’s planning reserve margin up to 15 percent system-wide

Upgrading two of four existing natural gas-fired turbines at the Lenzie Generating Station that will add an additional 37 megawatts of capacity at a cost of $46.3 million

Installing a “wet compression” water injection system on two existing combustion turbines at the Higgins Generating Station for an additional 32 megawatts of capacity at a cost of $6.5 million

Fulfillment of a contract with the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority for a hydropower PPA adding 209 megawatts of capacity over the summer

While the utility wrote in PUC filings that it doesn’t believe any policy changes are necessary to meet demand this summer it said the above proposed changes to its energy supply plan are necessary as the current plan is “inadequate to address the potential for extreme weather power demand due to climate change and provide adequate planning reserves.”

In future planning proceedings before the PUC the utility also suggested revisiting its formula for weather predictions and correlated demand planning. NV Energy uses a rolling 20-year average in guessing weather and demand but said the formula doesn’t fully capture the warming trend in recent years.

PUC staff also suggested that the utility hold more frequent meetings to determine if “firmer” market purchases can be made ahead of expected hot weather as opposed to relying on real-time or day-ahead energy markets.

Sullivan who often testifies on clean energy issues before the Nevada Legislature and in PUC dockets said that policymakers can take other steps to shore up grid reliability and reduce the impact of major weather events on the grid.

His group is supporting legislation in the 2021 Legislature to raise energy efficiency standards — a concept that he said reduces the demand strain on the grid by keeping indoor temperatures less variable on the weather.

Overall Sullivan said that the best way to ensure reliability on the grid while increasing the utility’s share of renewable energy resources was diversity — solar in Southern Nevada geothermal in Northern Nevada and tapping into hydropower or wind energy from other states where possible.

“One of the ways to have a highly renewable resilient reliable affordable energy system is to have a diversity of renewable energy resources” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvV2lsbC1pdC1iZS1NYXJjaC1NYWRuZXNzLW9yLU1hcmNoLXNhZG5lc3MtaW4tTGFzLVZlZ2FzLXRoaXMteWVhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,March Madness in Las Vegas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/North-America-Travel/Will-it-be-March-Madness-or-March-sadness-in-Las-Vegas-this-year on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vTm9ydGgtQW1lcmljYS1UcmF2ZWwvV2lsbC1pdC1iZS1NYXJjaC1NYWRuZXNzLW9yLU1hcmNoLXNhZG5lc3MtaW4tTGFzLVZlZ2FzLXRoaXMteWVhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvYWZ0ZXItbW9udGhzLW9mLWNvdmlkLW1pc2VyeS1jYXNpbm8tY29tcGFuaWVzLXJlYWR5LWZvci1hLXJlYm91bmQtMjI4NTM2MS_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtY29sdW1ucy9pbnNpZGUtZ2FtaW5nL2FmdGVyLW1vbnRocy1vZi1jb3ZpZC1taXNlcnktY2FzaW5vLWNvbXBhbmllcy1yZWFkeS1mb3ItYS1yZWJvdW5kLTIyODUzNjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After months of COVID misery casino companies ready for a rebound,"The coronavirus pandemic has squeezed Nevada’s casinos but it looks like the outlook is finally changing and companies are preparing for the comeback they’ve expected.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

The Las Vegas Strip is largely empty after Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered a mandatory shutdown of most nonessential businesses in the state due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. Photo taken on Friday March 20 2020 in Las Vegas. (Benjamin Hager/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @benjaminhphoto

As Nevada approaches the anniversary of the start of the 78-day coronavirus-induced casino shutdown several sources are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.

The only problem is that it’s a really long tunnel.

Last week the American Gaming Association said the U.S. commercial gaming industry saw revenue hit a 17-year low of $30 billion in 2020 off by 31 percent from 2019. Everybody saw that coming and an optimistic point of view would be that now that most properties have reopened and are seeing casino floor capacities raised and customers returning there’s nowhere to go but up.

Look no further than MGM Resorts International for a taste of that optimism as the company last week announced that it is ready to go back to 24/7 operations at The Mirage Mandalay Bay and Park MGM beginning March 3.

While some companies have focused on keeping their doors open and paying their slimmed-down staffs during the pandemic a few have begun investing in new technology infrastructure to better serve customers when they do return.

Boyd Gaming Corp. collaborating with Aristocrat Technologies announced last week that it is on the verge of rolling out a “digital wallet” on a mobile app that is linked to Boyd’s B Connected loyalty program.

Similarly Golden Entertainment Inc. the company behind The Strat Arizona Charlie’s and the PT’s Pub franchise will debut Quick Play with Konami Gaming tying in with Golden’s True Rewards program.

During an earnings call last week Boyd lamented how rough 2020 has been for the company. The strength of Boyd’s regional properties portfolio has mitigated some of the damage hitting the company’s Las Vegas locals properties.

Boyd still hasn’t opened Main Street Station in downtown Las Vegas and the Eastside Cannery on Boulder Highway and the company has been hammered downtown in a market segment that it has dominated for years — the Hawaiian Islanders.

The addition of special quarantine protocols for travel between the islands and the mainland have wreaked havoc with that key Boyd market. Boyd has perfected the pipeline between Hawaii and downtown Las Vegas over time so the return to normalcy can’t come too soon for that company.

Boyd and its locals casino rivals Station Casinos have weathered the pandemic relatively well just as gaming industry analysts predicted. Boyd and Station’s parent company Red Rock Resorts were among the rare number of casino companies that registered a fourth-quarter earnings profit.

With the fourth-quarter earnings season a little more than halfway complete the locals and regional companies are surviving better than their Strip counterparts mainly because the amenities the Strip is so famous for — quality entertainment fabulous restaurants big-time professional sports and renowned spas — are shut down or extremely limited by the government’s virus protocols.

In the fourth quarter the largest Las Vegas companies — Las Vegas Sands Corp. MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd. — have collectively lost more than $1 billion. (Caesars Entertainment Inc. is scheduled to report Thursday.)

The airlines that fly tourists to Las Vegas aren’t doing much better with Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. collectively posting close to $1 billion in losses.

Now we’re ready to turn the page. It appears that state health leaders and the government are finally on track to deliver vaccinations and that the public has become more receptive to getting the shots.

There’s light at the end of that long tunnel. and it’s going to take a little more perseverance to reach it.

Today's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW

The mother-of-two has stuck with the MMA fighter through thick-and-thin with their love story beginning in Crumlin.

Dee even confessed she does a separate shop for Conor.

In a previous interview Dee spoke of how she goes the extra mile for her love to make sure he performs at his best.

‘This is what Conor does so I’m definitely all in. I’m 100% on his team by his side. I help him out in every way I can’ she said.

‘I do his shopping separate from all the others make sure he has the best stuff and all organic ingredients.

‘I definitely don’t keep distance.’

In the YouTube montage the Dublin girl can be seen helping Conor McGregor out with his stretches as well as giving him a massage.

The UFC fighter had opened up about how the two first met admitting that they used to talk through Bebo while he was undergoing a plumbing apprenticeship in 2008.

‘We met at a friend’s party like way way back and then the usual social media a little bit of a like here and a like there and then a message’ he said on The Late Late Show.

The two were together when Conor shot up into fame in 2013 with his UFC debut.

Everyone knows that Dee was instrumental in the fighter’s early rise which resulted in a $60000 win for a Knockout of the Night bonus in Sweden.

At the time the Crumlin man insisted he was fighting to secure the couple’s future.

‘I’m doing this to secure my family’s future and Dee’s future. One day I want myself and Dee to be able to chill on a beach and not have any worry in the world’ he said.

‘That’s why I’m doing this. I want to be financially secure by the time I have kids. When that happens I want to be ready.’

In 2015 Conor McGregor was dubbed the UFC’s undisputed featherweight champion after knocking out opponent Jose Aldo in just 13 seconds.

And Dee couldn’t have been more prouder writing: ‘Words can’t describe this!

‘What an absolutely unbelievable night!

‘I’m so proud to be part of this journey with you babe you are the true definition of a champion and nobody deserves it more!”with Dee behind him every step of the way.’

Meanwhile as Conor made his way through the ranks he paid tribute to his partner.

‘My girlfriend has been there since the start. She has helped me throughout this career. If it wasn’t for her I probably wouldn’t be where I am today.’

He continued: ‘For me to be able to take her out of work give her everything she’s ever wanted and to travel the world with her fills me with pride. It keeps me going. We’ve been together a long time. She’s been through it all with me.’

Since his dizzying heights of featherweight champion in 2015 Conor has suffered a number of blows but Dee has stuck by with him after he suffered defeat to Nate Diaz in 2016.

He made history after becoming the first fighter to hold two belts at the same time after defeating Eddie Alvarez at Madison Square Garden.

And in his victory announcement he revealed that was a dad-to-be as he takes a two-year break from fighting.

‘I’m going to be a daddy early next year. I’m crapping my jocks!’ In May 2017 Conor Jr was born.

And in July 2018 Dee revealed that the couple were expecting their second child.

‘Happy 30th birthday babe! Thank you for being you! Love you to bits from me Conor jr and the bump’ she wrote on Instagram.

In January 2019 the couple welcomed their second child Croia.

And in August 2020 the pair announced their engagement after over a decade together.

Over the Christmas holidays Dee and Conor revealed that they were expecting their third child together posting a picture of Dee’s ultrasound in front of their Christmas tree.

‘Happy Christmas everyone from my family to yours. So much to look forward to in 2021!’

And she had tears in her eyes as she embraced her fiancee Conor McGregor following his surprise defeat at UFC 257 to Dustin Poirier this year.

Speaking at the post-fight press conference McGregor said that he is looking forward to getting back to ‘having fun’ with his family in order to get past the defeat.

Which the family seem to be doing as they enjoy what Dubai has to offer following the fight."

Officials with Xcel Energy announced Sunday that its Southwest Power Pool moved to normal operating status at 10 p.m. Saturday after inclement winter weather affected power usage throughout the last week.

According to a news release the pool previously indicated Xcel Energy to initiate ""two brief rounds of controlled outages"" on Feb. 15 and 16 when energy demand went above available resources in the region.

“We are relieved this emergency is behind us and grateful for the support and understanding of our customers who conserved energy through a long and frigid week” David Hudson the president of Xcel Energy – New Mexico Texas said in the release. “Likewise our power plant workers did an amazing job generating electricity in the harshest of conditions with limited supplies of fuel sparing us from the lengthy outages experienced in other parts of the state.

""We will work with our suppliers and regulators to identify the problems that led to these fuel shortages and take steps to ensure they are corrected"" Hudson continued. ""This was an unusual weather event but it can happen again. We deeply appreciate our customers’ efforts to conserve energy to help preserve the bulk electric system.”

Given the awful power grid mess in Texas it’s interesting to look at the ongoing electricity planning discussions for the Upper Midwest. In the summer of 2019 the region’s power provider Xcel Energy put together a resource proposal for the next 15 years that achieves an impressive 80% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from 2005 levels).



Xcel Energy plans to decrease emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2030. (Source: Upper Midwest Integrated Resource Plan for 2020-2034 2019)

The 156-page report is comprehensive and thoughtful. Xcel did a lot of work on their own plus hired a top-notch firm (E3) to do an independent analysis. Xcel collaborated with environmental organizations and community stakeholders over several years and has been transparent about their planning methodology adjusting it based on feedback. Their analysis combines advanced modeling of power plant performance and costs with real-world experience reflecting how systems perform in cold weather and on hot summer days. The report pays close attention to reliability cost and emissions reductions as well as impact on local communities.

Xcel Energy proposes to retire all of its coal plants a decade early and to add considerable solar and wind energy. It will also ramp up energy efficiency and sources of flexible demand (e.g. electric air conditioners or water heaters that the utility can adjust when power is tight). They plan to extend one nuclear contract and increase gas production to supplement and complement the growth in grid renewables.



Xcel Energy looks to significantly grow wind solar and natural gas by 2034 while eliminating coal (Source: Upper Midwest Integrated Resource Plan for 2020-2034 2019)

Impressive. But some are asking can they do better? Over the last few weeks several organizations have filed comments on Xcel’s proposal some of which are so substantive that they amount to independently-crafted proposals. Analysts hired by environmental organizations used the same modeling software as Xcel did but adjusted some parameters. The reports claim to show that plans with no added gas can achieve similar or better reliability and cost.

One analysis by the Energy Futures Group done on behalf of four environmental organizations identifies a number of mistakes in the initial modeling fixes those and incorporates new information about model parameters that has become available since Xcel’s proposal was published in mid-2019. For example they adjusted costs and lifetimes for renewables and batteries to updated standard values incorporated a few renewable projects that Xcel has already approved and added support for hybrid solar (solar plus battery). (1) Their analysis also assumes that somewhat longer duration storage (flow batteries) will be available in twenty years. With this they found no need for additional natural gas as shown in the “Clean Energy Plan” below.



One group of environmental organizations adapted the model that Xcel used to show that significant amounts of solar-plus-battery (“solar hybrid”) combined with small amounts of longer duration flow batteries can eliminate the need for additional gas (noted as “CT” and “Sherco CC”). (Source: A Clean Energy Future for Xcel by the Energy Futures Group 2021)

The Sierra Club has also contributed a very in-depth analysis again using the same modeling platform as Xcel used. They found and addressed many of the same issues as the Energy Futures Group report. Battery plant life estimates were too low solar and wind costs too high renewable plants constrained to be very large solar-plus-battery projects were missing improved wind technology was not reflected and so on. They observed as did the Energy Futures Group that the new gas plant (“Sherco”) seems to have been hard-coded into all of the model runs. When they make it optional it is not recommended by the modeling software since it seems to increase costs without increasing reliability. Their plan does not require additional gas resources.

The Sierra Club also looked closely at whether the contract with the Monticello nuclear plant needs to be extended as proposed by Xcel Energy.

Xcel does not shy away from its commitment to nuclear energy saying that nuclear is “an important system resource during the winter months as it does not experience fuel supply issues and has a great track record during cold weather events.” They add that transmission constraints make nuclear necessary: “We simply could not maintain our system reliably or affordably given the massive renewable additions and corresponding transmission infrastructure that would be required to replace our Monticello nuclear plant if it were even possible by 2030 given (our system’s) current transmission expansion issues.”

The Sierra Club report does not dismiss Xcel’s transmission concerns but instead notes that small local renewable deployments especially solar and batteries can help address that concern. They say that “traditional resource planning tools neglect the significant reliability and diversity benefits of distributed generation” and recommend tripling the amount of community solar and other distributed generation. They emphasize that these smaller plants create more local jobs and increase community investment when compared to utility-scale renewables while also reducing pressure on the transmission grid.

The differences in the two plans are summarized in this chart below from the Sierra Club’s proposal.



The Sierra Club recommends significantly more hybrid solar distributed solar and battery storage and no additional gas or extension of nuclear. (Source: Sierra Club submitted comments 2021)

It is interesting in light of the disaster in Texas to understand what the proposals say about grid performance in cold weather which can be extreme in the Upper Midwest. Xcel calls out two examples: the polar vortex of 2019 (January 28-30) and a more typical cold winter day (February 5). The graph below shows virtually no wind production during those times.



This chart shows fall-offs in renewables during the polar vortex of 2019 (see Jan 30) and during a more typical winter day (Feb 5). Source: Xcel Energy’s Reliability Appendix in this document.

Xcel is concerned about the duration of these events and the ability of batteries to handle them. For example regarding February 5 they say: “Between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. there were 16 consecutive hours where Net Load (load not handled by renewables) was over 5400 MW. Due to the duration and magnitude of this shortfall neither (flexible load) nor energy storage could substantially contribute to reducing the Net Load at least for the entire period.” Substantial amounts of imported energy kept the lights on though Xcel also requested that people turn down their thermostats. (2) Xcel’s resource plan says with notable foresight that the 2019 polar vortex “although extreme … may reasonably be expected to occur again”.

The Sierra Club in response points out that (as was the case in Texas) there were many resource outages during the polar vortex with fossil plants affected as much as wind. While the wind outages were more of a surprise the grid improved its winter wind forecasting immediately after this weather event by adding a temperature limit for wind turbines.



During the 2019 polar vortex about 25% of capacity was offline including fossil fuel and wind. (Source: MISO January 29-30 Maximum Generation Event Overview 2019)

The Sierra Club mentions the possibility of weatherizing renewables (e.g. turbine insulation and heaters) but overall takes the stance that imports are the right solution here. “Power system planners like all infrastructure engineers do not design the system to be perfectly reliable during all conceivable events as the cost of building such a system would be prohibitive and outweigh the benefits….The extreme temperatures necessary to cause generator failures will not affect a large geographic area simultaneously and so any local drops in output can be addressed with imports from other parts of (our power market) or other regions.” They also suggest with considerably less foresight than Xcel that “this was an historic event so such an extreme event is unlikely to be repeated for some time.”



The Upper Midwest’s power market MISO imported large amounts of energy from nearby PJM during the 2019 polar vortex. All markets from SPP east are part of the “Eastern Interconnection” with the exception of Texas’ ERCOT. (3)

So what is the right answer for Xcel Energy and the Upper Midwest? Should they add more gas to their grid and extend the life of their nuclear plant in order to shore up variable renewables? Or should they double down on batteries smart combinations of renewables (4) and imports to build an efficient reliable and even lower-emission grid? How do we evaluate the cost reliability and risk of different energy portfolios given so many unknowns? We have some good ideas about how technology costs and climate will evolve but there are many gaps. We have to make our best guesses and create a plan that can flex as we learn more. Do we continue to invest in fossil fuel infrastructure as Xcel recommends or place a bigger bet on evolving technology and lean into the future with a cleaner ambition? This is a very interesting and important discussion.

2. Xcel says: “The level of these resources that MISO had to use to remain operational and avoid further emergency actions ranged from 5000 MW to 11500 MW – with an average of 6500 MW on January 30th. The maximum offered reserve resources was 13500 MW which MISO nearly exhausted at one point in order to avoid a critical deficiency in available energy.” ( MISO stands for Midcontinent Independent System Operator and is the power market for the Upper Midwest just as CAISO is the power market for our area.)

Nor did they have to cope with the more localized outages that hit residents of Oregon Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Virginia West Virginia Ohio and Kentucky. Nor was a power system failure an issue here as it was with the Southwest Power Pool which covers Kansas Oklahoma and parts of another dozen states across the Great Plains.

The SPP instituted rolling blackouts for the first time in its 80-year history to head off a total collapse of its system as demand for power exceeded supply for several days.

“Colorado has gone through the exercise of weatherizing the system. Overall it seems that Colorado has been preparing very well” said Morgan Bazilian director of the Payne Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden.

But Colorado consumers likely won’t get off scot-free. The lack of adequate preparation in other states could show up in higher fuel costs on utility bills in the coming months depending on how much regulators allow to pass through.

Extreme demand for electricity and natural gas caused short-term prices to surge. Keeping the power on in the state came with added costs the Colorado Public Utilities Commission has asked utilities to detail in a “general situational report” by Wednesday said PUC spokesman Terry Bote.

For example the spot price for natural gas at the Rocky Mountain-Cheyenne hub the regional market surged from under $3 an MMbtu (one million British Thermal Units the measurement used for natural gas) before the cold snap to around $190 per MMbtu early last week as the demand to heat homes competed with providing fuel to natural gas turbines that generate electricity.

The Public Service Company of Colorado a subsidiary of Xcel Energy estimates it had to spend an extra $650 million in electricity and natural gas costs through Tuesday because of surging commodity prices according to a 10-K filing it made last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We expect our regulator to undertake a heightened review and we intend to work with our commission to recover these costs over time to help mitigate the impacts on customer bills” the company said in its filing. The company also plans to expand a debt offering so it has enough money to cover the gap between paying fuel providers and collecting from customers.

To head off higher fuel costs Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association based in Westminster switched from natural gas to fuel oil to power its combustion turbines early last week said Mark Stutz a spokesman for the member-owned power provider.

“While this weather event itself was historic its impact on our system was not unlike weather events we have seen in previous years. Tri-State draws on a wide range of generation resources power contracts and power purchases to help ensure electricity is available for our members” he said.

Diversify connect and plan

In many ways the widespread failures in Texas are because of reasons unique to Texas. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT responsible for balancing power in the majority of the state is self-contained by design in part to avoid federal regulations that come with crossing state lines.

Federal power regulators had asked power producers in the state to winterize better after power failures because of cold temperatures in 2011 but they couldn’t force the issue and that has come back to bite both Texas and regulators.

Dennis Wamsted an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said the electricity market in Texas incentivizes companies to keep costs as low as possible meaning they aren’t as likely to pay to insulate equipment and plants for the kind of “almost unprecedented” cold weather that gripped the state last week.

“I’m not sure there are any real lessons for Colorado. I think that there are a lot of places around the world including Colorado where we’re much more used to cold weather. Because we have cold spells far more often there’s a lot more investment that’s been made to make sure that equipment works during cold weather” said Will Toor executive director of the Colorado Energy Office.

Some energy analysts and politicians most notably Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott have blamed renewable sources for the crisis especially wind generation which provides about a quarter of the power in Texas but suffered a big drop as blades iced over and the wind died.

But utility and energy experts argue there was plenty of blame to go around and that finger-pointing works against finding needed solutions.

“This is a complex and very important issue that people need to understand. We aren’t interested in playing that political back-and-forth game. It is disheartening” said Dustin Meyer vice president of natural gas markets at the American Petroleum Institute.

Xcel Energy has winterized its wind turbines in Colorado and Minnesota allowing them to perform at temperatures as low as -22 degrees said Michelle Aguayo spokeswoman for Xcel Energy Colorado. But even then the turbines still need wind which was in very short supply early last week.

Stutz echoed that saying both solar and wind generation fell on the Tri-State system. At the Southwest Power Pool wind generation which represents just under a third of electricity production on average ran about 10% on Monday and Tuesday.

But none of that came as a surprise. Grid operators knew that renewables would underperform in extreme cold and they could forecast it precisely.

“Wind production has performed as we have forecasted on a minute-by-minute hour-by-hour and day-by-day basis” said Lanny Nickell chief operating officer of the SPP. “We didn’t expect to have a windy day on a subzero temperature day.”

What surprised utility operators was when natural gas coal and even nuclear underperformed in the cold temperatures leaving them unable to fill the gap. Even in Texas thermal sources were meeting increased demand through the weekend until things got so cold they couldn’t.

Highlighting the importance of diverse power sources one power authority within the SPP drained a lake to create additional power to meet demand. Hydropower from the Western Area Power Administration also came to the rescue.

Power supplies on the SPP system came up short 1.5% of demand on Monday requiring targeted blackouts lasting about 50 minutes Nickell said. The situation got worse on Tuesday when more power generation went offline. The system was short 6% of the power supply it needed necessitating dispersed blackouts that lasted three hours and 20 minutes.

Still that was better than Texas where outages stretched across multiple days in sub-freezing temperatures. Nickell said a helping hand from neighboring states was critical. Imports from nearby states including 210 megawatts of electricity from the Public Service Company of Colorado averted a more severe disaster. But in the early morning and evening hours many outside utilities had to use every drop of power to serve their own customers. And as demand rose it became more difficult to move resources on congested transmission networks.

One lesson that Colorado and other Western states who historically have operated with a comparatively balkanized grid should take to heart is the importance of being connected to a bigger regional system. Having other resources to draw on in a pinch will become increasingly important as intermittent sources of power like wind and solar represent a larger share of the mix Toor said.

Colorado utilities were about to join the SPP about three years ago when Xcel Energy Colorado backed out citing a lack of adequate cost savings. Tri-State has moved forward with forging closer ties to the SPP while Xcel Energy Black Hills Colorado Electric Colorado Springs Utilities and the Platte River Power Authority are looking to the California Western Energy Imbalance Market.

But that isn’t necessarily a bad thing in that Colorado power providers will have a foot in two large regional groups.

Dry weather let the blaze grow into the Lake Christine Fire which would burn more than 12000 acres and destroy about half a dozen homes.

It also burned three of four transmission lines running into Aspen. If the fourth had gone down the city could have lost electricity for weeks according to Holy Cross Energy the local power supplier.

“They had a near miss” said Mark Dyson a researcher for the Rocky Mountain Institute who studies Colorado’s energy grid. The clean energy think tank would later help the utility harden its grid against future threats from extreme weather.

Those challenges are getting more attention after a recent cold snap caused millions to lose power in Texas. The same frigid blast froze wind farms and restricted the natural gas supply in Colorado but the state did not experience widespread blackouts.

Dyson warns future disasters might not be so forgiving. Hackers or terrorists could find ways to cripple the electrical system. Climate change is also set to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and wildfires.

Here’s what those threats could do to the grid and what people could do to protect it.

Did Colorado’s electric grid face any challenges in the recent cold snap?

Yes. The most notable example occurred in Northern Colorado where communities rely on the Platte River Power Authority for electricity. One of its wind farms froze on Sunday. A far larger problem occurred later in the day when Xcel Energy curtailed the supply of natural gas to preserve fuel for home heating. That meant the Platte River utility couldn’t flip on turbines it uses to meet peak energy demands.

The stacked problems forced the utility to ask customers to reduce their power usage Sunday evening. Steve Roalstad a Platte River spokesperson said people answered the call and helped avoid any outages from the generation struggles.

The Colorado Public Utility Commission has since opened an investigation into how utilities handled the cold snap. The competition for natural gas caused a spike in prices. Commissioners plan to find out if any of those costs could be passed onto ratepayers.

Why is everything worse in Texas?

The main reason is the difference between states’ natural gas systems.

Officials for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which manages power distribution said natural gas providers simply weren’t set up to handle the cold. Frozen pipelines restricted the supply of fuel to power plants where components also failed.

A few factors helped keep the lights on in Colorado. Dyson said the state’s natural gas infrastructure is built for cold weather. Most Colorado homes also rely on gas furnaces for heat which means cold temperatures don’t cause a massive spike in electric demand.

By contrast buildings in Texas aren't insulated against the cold and use inefficient electrical resistance heat. When temperatures dropped electricity demand spiked just as power plants struggled to produce enough power.

Are other weather events or natural disasters more likely to cause power outages?

A 2010 state report found winter weather such as ice and snow is one of the most common problems for utilities in the state. Infrastructure in rural counties are also damaged by lightning strong winds and fires which bring down lines and cut power.

Dyson said utilities are set up to handle those local power outages. A Rocky Mountain Institute report he authored looks at the potential for more expansive power losses where natural disasters or malicious attacks take out fuel supplies or power plants. Those disasters could create “cascading failures” affecting far more energy users. Extreme weather like cold spells high winds and wildlife could all cause such a failure in Colorado. The state’s critical energy infrastructure is also at risk from physical attacks or solar storms.

Colorado climate plans call for far more renewables and far fewer fossil fuels. Will that make the grid more vulnerable?

Not necessarily. Renewables could actually help make the grid more resilient with the right technologies.

In the aftermath of the Texas power outages fossil fuel advocates and some Republican politicians blamed frozen wind turbines for the problems. Texas officials have since debunked the claims showing natural gas failures were the main cause of the blackouts.

Nevertheless Colorado fossil fuel advocates insist the state’s grid needs natural gas to remain reliable. Lynn Granger the executive director for the American Petroleum Institute Colorado told CPR News natural gas is unique in its ability to “ensure grid reliability” especially as the state transitions to more and more wind and solar. While those energy sources depend on the weather gas turbines can power up so long as fuel is available and systems aren’t broken.

Clean energy advocates counter renewables could help solve a deeper problem with traditional energy grids. Dyson said 20th-century power systems rely on centralized plants which means a single failure can cascade down to millions of homes. New technologies like solar panels and energy storage could allow a community to generate and distribute power at a much more local level.

“With generation sources on-site communities wouldn’t need to rely on imported power or fuel” Dyson said.

What puts more strain on Colorado’s grid: extreme cold or extreme heat?

Experts say extreme heat is a far bigger challenge. On a hot summer afternoon people crank up the air conditioning and create huge spikes in electricity demand. Utilities are also more equipped to handle extreme cold in Colorado than in Texas said Justin Brant co-director of the utility program with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project.

“You can buy technologies now that are a little more winterized” he said. “It's just a question of investing more into technologies that are more resilient to cold or heat or other stresses.”

Hotter temperatures brought on by climate change however could pose a greater risk to the grid down the line. Brant said energy conservation could help protect the electrical system. Having smaller grids all over the state instead of a few larger ones could also help prevent large-scale outages.

Are wildfires a major threat to the electricity grid?

In short yes. Brant said wildfires are both a cause and effect of problems with the electric grid.

Though they can burn power lines and cause outages those lines can also start fires when there are strong winds and dry conditions such as the Camp Fire in California in 2018. Utilities in the state now turn off the electric grid when there is high fire danger a strategy that is also being discussed in Colorado as climate change makes large wildfires more common he said.

Xcel Energy has proposed a plan to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to strengthen the grid and protect it from wildfire damage.

Many utilities hope to use large batteries to store renewable energy. Are those systems vulnerable to climate threats?

Though overheating has caused battery explosions in hotter states like Arizona that is less of a concern in Colorado where the weather is milder Brant said.

In the future the main issue with batteries will be whether they can store enough power when renewables are not producing energy said Will Toor the executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. Right now he said batteries wouldn’t last through a stretch of cold and gray weather like what hit Colorado this month.

“When you get those multi-day weather events under current battery technologies you probably need some other form of backup or ultimately zero-carbon generation in order to provide enough storage” Toor said.

Could “microgrids” help?

Experts say microgrids installed around essential services such as hospitals or emergency operation centers could be “islands” amid otherwise dysfunctional grids.

“You can imagine a world where you would have significant on-site solar significant battery storage and an ability to operate those critical facilities even during periods when the grid was down” Toor said. “I think we will see a substantial move towards microgrids especially for those kinds of critical facilities.”"
