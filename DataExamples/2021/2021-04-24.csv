On August 23 2019 Metropolitan Police officers investigating drug trafficking found 30kg of heroin inside a holdall on a bed in Hinds' home.

Hinds was in the bedroom and while a search was being carried out officers noticed Yucetas approaching the address.

He was detained and both men were found to have similar encrypted mobile devices on them.

Yucetas' home was later searched and police say they found further evidence of drug supply.

Mobile phone analysis established Hinds and Yucetas had organised the heroin to be delivered to Hinds' home in the early hours of August 23.

The jury at Wood Green Crown Court would later hear evidence from a drugs expert who estimated the heroin to be worth over £3 million in street value terms.

In court on Friday both men were jailed having previously been convicted of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and failure to disclose pin codes to protected information held within encrypted mobile phones.

Hinds was sentenced to 14 years and three months in prison while Yucetas was jailed for 15 years.

Serious crime prevention orders were granted against both men restricting their use of mobile phones preventing their association and limiting their financial capabilities once released from prison.

Detective Superintendent Neil Ballard from the Met's specialist crime command said: ""These two men were known to law enforcement agencies for drug trafficking and this was a significant amount of heroin taken off the streets of London.

""Hinds and Yucetas' sentences should stand as a deterrent to others. It's a clear example that the Met continues to target those involved in serious and organised crime to reduce drugs supply and the violence associated with it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjci5jby56YS9zaG93cy9zdGFjZXktanNidS93YXRjaC0zbS1sb25nLWdyZWF0LXdoaXRlLXNoYXJrLXN3aW1zLWFtb25nc3Qtc3VyZmVycy1wbGV0dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH: 3m long Great White shark swims amongst surfers in Plett,"Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File reports that in 2018 only four people were killed by sharks worldwide which was below the normal average of six.

But Eddie Irvine has taken a long long time — 18 years to be precise — to find a suitable buyer for his stunning luxury home near Dublin.

The playboy mansion in upmarket Dalkey where Hollywood movie star Matt Damon put his head down during his lockdown sojourn showed up on the Property Price Register last week following a surprise sale.

Ischia on Sorrento Road was being rented out by Irvine for £6104 a week but it went for a tidy £3.05 million in an off-market sale on April 15 according to the register.

The Co Down man has attempted to sell his 5000sq ft Dalkey pad numerous times over the last two decades but he failed to tempt buyers with a taste for life in the fast lane.

Yet there’s a lot to love about this posh property.

Featuring an outdoor pool linking to an indoor lagoon a party-size jacuzzi with impressive views over Dublin Bay and its own cinema room the new owner will also have world-famous Belfast blues musician Van Morrison as well as U2’s Bono and The Edge as their neighbours in the celeb enclave.

Inside the house which is split-level owing to the rocky cliffs on which it is built is a large dining area with seating for 12 and double-height ceilings.

It also boasts a large modern kitchen in high-gloss white and five double bedrooms — four of them en-suite — and a bathroom.

A games room including bar and snooker table opens to the pool which is surrounded by timber decking with seating and a barbecue area. Upstairs the living area enjoys the best views.

Award-winning architects Smith & Kennedy designed the white wood and glass house with a copper-clad curved exterior accessed via electric gates from a shared private driveway.

In 2003 the property then known as Kilross Lodge hit the market with an asking price of £5.7m.

The following year it nearly sold to publican Dave Cullen for £4.4m but the sale fell through.

It was then put up for short-term let for £15300 a month — a bargain compared to the initial rental being sought when the property first became available and rent was set at £5350 per week.

Irvine who is 55 and from Conlig was a successful property dealer even before he retired from F1 in 2002.

He is believed to have a portfolio of more than 50 properties around the world.

Last week it emerged that the ex-Ferrari driver turned luxury homebuilder sold a new waterfront mansion on the Venetian Islands in Miami Beach Florida for £12.3m.

With views across Biscayne Bay towards downtown Miami it boasts five bedrooms five bathrooms two half-bathrooms a balcony a dock a pool and a summer kitchen.

The sale continues the flurry of luxury home sales on the Venetian Islands mostly driven by out-of-state buyers.

The 5300sq foot home is Irvine’s second mansion sale in Miami Beach this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTEzNzkyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tuguegarao aims to plant 3M trees in next 3 years,"TREE SUMMIT.

TUGUEGARAO CITY – In celebration of World Earth Day Tuguegarao City launched its One Million Trees Movement through its first-ever Tree Summit last April 22.

The Tuguegarao One Million Trees Movement is a joint project of the Tuguegarao City government the Department of Environment and Natural Resources the Department of Agriculture the Department of Labor and Employment the Department of Social Welfare and Development the Cagayan State University the Schools Division of Tuguegarao City and the proponent of the movement the Northern Natural Resource Conservation Inc. (NNRC).

The objective of the movement is to encourage Tuguegarao residents and environmental advocates to restore the city's natural state through the planting and growing of 1 million trees in the next three years to counter the effects of climate change.

“[In] Tuguegarao City the effects of climate change are highly evident. It is time to act. The Tuguegarao City government [aims to] address this reality through the One Million Trees Movement” Mayor Jefferson P. Soriano said in his welcome remarks.

To ensure the sustainability of the movement the 8th City Council of Tuguegarao City has institutionalized the Tuguegarao One Million Trees Movement through the enactment of City Ordinance No. 26-08-2021.

The ordinance localized Proclamation No. 643 signed in 2004 declaring June 25 of every year as Philippine Arbor Day that enjoins all able-bodied citizens to plant one tree every year.

The four-hour summit was participated in by regional line agencies civil society organizations barangay captains Sangguniang Kabataan officials business establishments and other private individuals.

Discussed in the summit were Climate Change and its Effects by Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (NOAH) Center Executive Director Alfredo Lagmay Climate Change Resiliency by World Bank consulting lawyer Karen Jimeno Bamboo Industry and Climate Change Mitigation by Philippine Bamboo Foundation president Edgardo Manda and Tuguegarao One Million Trees Movement by NNRC founders Angelo Giovanni Guzman and Maria Rosario Soriano.

Guzman said he presented the project to Soriano in September last year.

""Until one fateful September day last year when I gathered just enough courage and kapal ng mukha (guts) to try and make a case of my dream again. Telling him [Mayor Soriano] about the Koronadal City experience. I was taken aback when he said 'Okay let's go!'. And that was it. Those three words are the sweetest three words I have ever heard. I was asking for 100K trees and yet he gave me a number that makes me smile to this very day. One million trees for my beloved Tuguegarao. I said to myself this is not only a project. This is a Life Mission already. Wow Tuguegarao na Talaga"" Guzman said.

Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu gave his keynote speech at the event and all the participants signed the Pledge of Commitment to end the summit. (PR)

Abbott left a legacy of selfless giving.

“Far-reaching” and “comprehensive” describe the foundation’s ongoing giving over the past 48 years with over $27 million distributed just since 1992.

A longtime Lincoln resident Ethel spent her final years in Omaha where she maintained ties with the family of the man who helped her establish her foundation in 1972 – Delmar Lienemann Sr.

Current Foundation President Dorothy (Lienemann) Pflug and her young family regularly received baby and Christmas gifts from Abbott. Pflug recalled one gift in particular – a silver train bank for her eldest son engraved with his full name William Peck Pflug. It was William’s great-grandfather Burlington Northern Railroad engineer Earl Peck who introduced Del Lienemann Sr. to Ethel and her second husband Christopher Abbott.

Lienemann a Lincoln CPA who had already established his own foundation helped Ethel do the same after Chris Abbott’s death. The Ethel S. Abbott Charitable Foundation became fully funded in 1992 upon Ethel’s passing when an additional $15 million from her estate was added. Today the fund has grown to over $25 million.

Pflug administers foundation funds along with her four sibling board members -- Denise Scholz Dan Lienemann Doug Lienemann and Del Lienemann Jr.

She hopes that Ethel’s example will encourage others to give back to the community and to organizations that mean something to them.

“It can be huge. It’s what it does for the culture of our community to encourage people to be givers versus takers” Pflug said.

Ethel who lived to be 97 married Raymond H. Page in 1924 and together they operated the Lincoln Aircraft Company. The couple taught Charles Lindbergh to fly and even received a telegram when he landed in Paris in 1927 after his transatlantic flight.

Ethel was widowed in 1932 and remarried to Christopher J. Abbott in 1933. The couple resided in Hyannis and operated seven ranches. Chris Abbott was also president of 10 banks. In 1946 he expanded his interests to include Prairie Airways in Lincoln Rocket Air Service in Omaha and radio station KFNF in Shenandoah Iowa. At the time he was considered the wealthiest man in Nebraska.

Ethel stayed connected to the Lienemanns and their children. Pflug and her family would visit Ethel at the Regency Apartments in Omaha and she was always a part of their extended family sending cards and gifts when someone was in the hospital or sick.

For Pflug it is a privilege to be able to continue Abbott’s giving legacy.

“The motivation behind Ethel’s giving was to make Nebraska a better place and to bless Nebraska” Pflug shared.

The foundation carries on that giving legacy by making grants to 501(c)(3) organizations and government entities with 99 percent of its gifts staying in Nebraska. A longtime recipient of foundation gifts is the University of Nebraska Foundation. It received its first gift the year after the Ethel S. Abbott Charitable Foundation was established. Its most recent grant was awarded in 2020 to help fund the Lincoln campus’s UNMC College of Nursing Division building.

Giving has also benefited the Life Skills Center in Memorial Stadium that provides tutoring and academic support for approximately 600 student athletes and a similar academic space for Maverick athletes at UNO.

Brian Hastings president and CEO of the University of Nebraska Foundation shared that scholarships in Abbott’s name have supported hundreds of students. “They help make a lot possible across the community.”

Other University of Nebraska-linked beneficiaries have included the Lied Center Sheldon Art Gallery (its main auditorium is named after Abbott) faculty endowed chairs for the departments of business and nursing and Howard Hawks Hall ($375000 committed to the home of the College of Business that was dedicated three years ago).

“What’s unique about them is the depth and breadth of support” Hastings said.

Helping the disadvantaged is a prime interest of the Ethel S. Abbott Charitable Foundation. It has provided funds to UNMC to support its Sharing Clinic in the past and in 2020 gave $10000 to the Teammates Mentoring Program in Lincoln for background checks of the mentors who will inspire youth to reach their full potential. A $10000 Radio Talking Book Service 2020 grant reflects Abbott’s connection to helping those who can no longer read. She herself was blind the last years of her life.

Lincoln and Omaha Zoo foundations have also been grateful recipients of grant money. Abbott’s foundation gave $25000 to the Lincoln Children’s Zoo for its giraffe exhibit in 2020 (part of a 10-year $250000 commitment) and another $32200 for train car repairs for four of its cars.

Omaha Zoo Foundation received a two-year commitment totaling $500000 for 2020 and 2021 for the Owen Sea Lion Shores exhibit that opened last May. Pflug had read about the project in the newspaper and reached out to see how the Foundation could help.

The one-acre exhibit provides a state-of-the-art habitat for the zoo’s sea lions and features a 275000-gallon pool 40-foot-long underwater viewing window a kelp forest and sandy beach areas. Both the Abbott and Lienemann foundations will be recognized with signage near the underwater viewing area or “sea cave” that they adopted.

Pflug toured the exhibit while it was under construction and was sold on its potential impact. Sister Denise Scholz the Abbott Foundation's treasurer was able to view the exhibit upon completion and said “It was an amazing site to see them (the sea lions) swimming around and they’re very engaging when they go by.”

Scholz has been helping to decide where Abbott’s money can make the most impact on people’s lives and the community since 1992. She said she considers immediate needs and the sustainability of the organization making the request. Although most grant requests are unsolicited Scholz said that if board members see a need they will look into it.

Scholz reached out to the Governor’s Office to find the best way the Foundation could help bring relief to 2019 flood victims. Directed to the Nebraska Community Fund the Foundation put $500000 toward establishing the Nebraska Flood Recovery Fund to assist primarily low-income Nebraskans.

Keeper of a database of all of the requests that have been submitted over the years Scholz said they number in the thousands and cover a wide spectrum of projects and interests.

“Mrs. Abbott didn’t want to sustain things year in and year out” Scholz explained. “She was mostly interested in helping people get on their feet.”

A perfect example of that is the Foundation’s response to a request from Open Door Mission a 917-bed homeless shelter in Omaha. Gwynne Gonnerman donor relations manager for Open Door Mission shared that the $20000 gift helped cover extra COVID-19 related costs. The Mission was able to create an isolation area to quarantine guests as needed provide art and animal therapy for its guests put high-risk guests up in hotels establish portable hand-washing and hand-sanitizing stations and purchase computers to support students attending school online.

I've written how much I enjoy the game in the past and it appears that the rest of America has agreed with me as ratings have skyrocketed.

In the mid-2000s the University of Tennessee Volunteers were a mainstay in the WCWS and they were led by an absolute ace in Monica Abbott.

Abbott is a legendary softball player who has racked up countless accomplishments throughout her career and she's still going strong today.

Monica Abbott at Tennessee

Before she got her start with the Lady Vols Monica Abbott played on the softball team at North Salinas High School. The Vikings won three Central Coast Section division titles and Abbott couldn't be touched as she averaged nearly 300 strikeouts per season.

The ace only got better with age. She was interested in the Tennessee program because of how they treated their female athletes and it's safe to say her commitment was mutually beneficial.

Abbott pitched for the Volunteers from 2004-2007 and was a four-time First-Team All-American. She set NCAA records for wins and strikeouts won a Player of the Year award in 2007 and finished her tenure with 112 shutouts 23 no-hitters and six perfect games.

Those numbers earned her a spot in the Tennessee Athletics Hall of Fame and she truly is one of the best athletes the university has ever seen.

After graduation Abbott wasn't ready to give up on the game. She received an invitation to play for the US National Team and represent the United States in the Summer Olympics. She posted a microscopic 0.29 ERA and helped the Americans earn a silver medal in 2008.

This summer fans will get to see Abbott in Tokyo — a year after the pandemic tabled the scheduled 2020 games. USA Softball will be the favorites heading into the competition and look to win yet another gold medal.

Abbott has also starred at the softball World Championships most recently winning the gold in 2018. Her 1.62 ERA and 5-0 record were incredibly valuable.

Monica Abbott Today

Today Abbott is 35 years old but her career hasn't slowed down.

She suited up in the National Pro Fastpitch League from 2007-17 and even signed a six-year million-dollar contract with the Scrap Yard Dawgs.

She won five Pitcher of the Year awards in NPF.

Abbott has also taken her talents internationally. She has played in the Japan Professional Softball League since 2009 leading the way for the team sponsored by the Toyota Motor Corporation.

Monica Abbott is one of the most decorated softball pitchers in history. The college legend is also an Olympian and hopes to become a gold medalist.

When she decides to retire the sport will be losing one of the most electric talents it has ever seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjUvYXJ0aXN0LW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLTIwMjEtZGFuY2Utc2VtaWZpbmFsaXN0cy_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L2FydGlzdC1vZi10aGUteWVhci0yMDIxLWRhbmNlLXNlbWlmaW5hbGlzdHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artist of the Year 2021: Dance semifinalists,"From a list of 94 nominees the following 14 students have been named as semifinalists for the 2021 Artist of the Year in dance.

Corah Abbott senior Orange County School of the Arts

Specialty: Concert dance

“Whether portraying a character in a ballet or an original piece dancers are driven by complex and thought provoking topics. Through art we can converse in movement-based communication giving rise to conversations that are relevant in our society including social issues and mental health awareness.”

Maya Elizabeth Alvarez-Coyne senior Orange County School of the Arts

Specialty: World/cultural dance

“My dedication to Irish dancing is more than just performing on stage for a trophy. It is devoting 12 hours almost every weekend to dance rehearsals and sacrificing social activities with friends because of my busy training schedule. As training became more intense my Irish dance peers began to quit and thoughts of giving up filled my head. But in every moment of discouragement I saw an opportunity to work even harder.”

Michaela Maureen Capulong junior Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts

Specialty: Concert dance

“As a young dancer the physical realms of dance always came relatively easy for me; it was always the lack of artistry that held me back. It was only after years of being in the dance industry that I discovered I was confined merely to a box of what I was being instructed to do by my teachers. And artistry could not exist within those boundaries; it would have to come from myself. I would be lying if I said stepping out of the safety of that imaginary box was not terrifyingly daunting. But at the same time it was so freeing.”

Sophia Chung junior Northwood High School

Specialty: Commercial dance

“Oftentimes artistic expression is projecting to the audience and conveying emotions so that others can feel what the performer is trying to deliver as a message. But to me an artist is not someone that gets the best reaction or emotion to the viewers but someone who is able to feel that emotion for themselves.”

Lyla Davey senior Huntington Academy of Dance

Specialty: Concert dance

“As a dancer I feel that my art is defined by the expression of myself through movement and music. I am my best artist when I am performing and collaborating with other dancers directors and an audience. I am an artist when I take the steps and make them my own whether it be a simple exercise in class or a complex variation. I am an artist when I add my own personality into the movements.”

Jessie Ann Hernandez senior Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts

Specialty: Concert dance

“In my life I know that I am an artist because I want my art to be the impetus to something for someone else. Whether it is through teaching children to dance in an after-school program or performing in front of hundreds of people in a concert auditorium I want my art to impact other people in a way that brings forward change and light through the expression of creativity.”

Calista McCanna junior San Juan Hills High School

Specialty: Commercial dance

“An artist is someone who is able to create and execute a message or idea to convey to an audience using any medium. Whether it’s through dance music visual art or more individuals can outlet to express themselves exploring more about who they are inside and out. An individual who is an artist expresses traits of creativity open mindedness to new ideas and can tell a story.”

Lucas McCollum-VanHoosear junior Orange County School of the Arts

“Dancers speak without words. To speak with one’s body requires technique as a means of conveying an emotion. This takes a great amount of strength and skill. It also takes dedication. Dancing helps to relieve the stress of everyday life. As a dancer I escape from reality when my feet hit the dance floor. I live for the art of making intricate moves seem simple calm and collected in smooth dances.”

“Artists are special because of their dedication to hours in the studio and exploration of creativity. From a young age dance has served as my creative outlet. In my artistic journey I have discovered a sense of freedom and empowerment which has lead me to a place of inner peace.”

“Though dance I have learned discipline adaptability and responsibility. I have also learned the great power of practice and how to be a team player. Learning these skills has positively affected both my academic and social life. Academically the difference has been tremendous. As I became a better dancer I also became a better student.”

“Teaching dancers how to maintain a healthy body and mind is extremely important. I have witnessed the direct connection between maintaining a healthy body and having lasting success in the rigors of a dance career. Pursuing a career in dance also comes with the countless opportunities to serve others by using our artistry. Throughout my four years of high school I was part of a club called “Halo Dance for Autism” where I used my ability as a dancer to raise awareness for children with autism.”

Danielle Silver junior Orange County School of the Arts

“In my art form of dance my favorite stories to share are my personal life experiences. Dance provides artists the opportunity to show people who they are without a verbal exchange of words. I take advantage of this opportunity by telling a story through movement and connection to music with stories of joy pain fear or other emotions all people understand.”

Miranda Van senior Fullerton Union High School

Specialty: Street dance

“I feel like dance has helped me mature emotionally and mentally. Life is full of obstacles. There will be times when I feel lost and so many things are being thrown at me. Dance has taught me how to feel those things and ultimately think through them. It is OK to feel a certain way because we are human but it all comes down to how we handle those emotions.”

Dawson Charles Walker senior Orange County School of the Arts

“For me dance is much more than just movement on a stage. Nowadays the possibilities of creating art with dance are endless. Recently I have been really into the filming medium and the incorporation of site-specific dance works. Due to COVID-19 I have found myself in my thoughts everyday choreographing and thinking of cool innovative ways to shoot things.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2tvbW90cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Bob3Rvcy1jaWNlcm8tdHdwLWp1bmlvci1maXJlZmlnaHRlci1wcm9ncmFtL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25fZGQ3MGEzNDgtYTU0Yy0xMWViLTkyYjYtMGIwNDcwNDY5OGRmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Cicero Twp. junior firefighter program | News | kokomotribune.com,"Kokomo IN (46901)

Suphachai Chearavanont CP Group’s chief executive officer was among six other CEOs who received awards on behalf of their companies. The other five were Dell Technologies’ Michael Dell Jo Ann Jenkins CEO of AARP Halsey Cook Jr CEO of Milliken Julie Sweet CEO of Accenture and Pakit Iamopas CEO of DTGO Corporation.

In a speech on the virtual stage Suphachai said CP Group has grown to a 400000-employee strong organization thanks to its strong ethical values.

He said of the six cultural values CP Group follows two are directly related to ethics. The first is the so-called “3 Benefits Principle” in which the company ensures it is the country and its people benefit before the company does.

He also said that CP Group values honesty and integrity which is the cornerstone of business and has helped it gain trust and creditability. He said the group will continue operating with social responsibility to create sustainable business growth.

“With this recognition from Ethisphere Institution we are deeply motivated to do more. Being an ethical company doesn’t mean that you cannot make mistakes we may make mistakes but we learn from our mistakes not to make them again.

“CP Group will continue to thrive to become a better company and we will never stop our efforts in making this company sustainable through ethical principles.

“Lastly I would like to say thank you to Ethisphere Institution for giving us this recognition. It really means a lot not only to myself as a CEO of the company but also to all of our 400000 employees who have been a major part in driving this throughout the company” Supachai said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hY2JyaWRnZS1vd25lcnMtcGFydG5lci1leHBsb3JlZC1kZWFsLXdpdGgtaGVubGV5LW9uLW1vbnRlbmVncm8uODY3MTQ40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Macbridge owner's partner explored deal with Henley on Montenegro citizenship,"A Chinese national linked to the owner of Macbridge signed a deal with Henley & Partners as a prospective consortium member for a bid to run Montenegro’s citizenship scheme documents show.

The documents show Mao Haibin representing the Shanghai-based concessionaries for Maltese residency visa sales in China signed an agreement in 2016 to form a consortium with Henley & Partners in a bid for the Montenegro concession.

Board minutes from Henley & Partners said a good Chinese immigration entity would be needed for the Montenegro citizenship bid and for this purpose discussions were held with the company run by Mao. It is not known if the deal went through.

It is not known if the deal went through

A year-long investigation by Times of Malta Reuters and other international journalism partners recently uncovered how Mao was in business with Tang Zhaomin the owner of Macbridge International Development.

Tang is in turn the mother-in-law of Accenture negotiator Chen Cheng who was involved in brokering multi-million euro deals with Enemalta including for the Montenegro wind farm project.

Macbridge was named in a 2015 email as one of two companies intended to pump money in to secret offshore Panama companies which Castille’s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Energy minister Konrad Mizzi took ownership of that year. The other source of funds was a company owned by murder suspect Yorgen Fenech 17 Black. Both secret companies were set up by Nexia BT’s Brian Tonna and Karl Cini.

As consultant with Accenture Chen played a key role in a €320 million deal for Chinese state-owned company Shanghai Electric Power to buy 33 per cent of Enemalta in 2014 and also pitched a Montenegro wind farm deal to the Maltese energy company which earned Fenech millions of euro.

Shanghai Overseas Exit-Entry Services Co Ltd a company run by Mao used to be the official concessionaire to sell Maltese residency visas in China.

Chinese records uncovered by the journalistic investigation showed that Mao has ties to both Chen and his mother-in-law – the woman who directs Macbridge.

Mao and Chen were partners in at least two companies including Shanghai Visabao Network Technology Co Ltd which operates in several major Chinese cities and helps Chinese citizens procure visas abroad.

Chen’s mother-in-law is a manager and shareholder at a Shanghai advertising agency controlled by Mao which in turn was a major sponsor of Malta Residence and Visa Programme events in China.",,,,,,,,,

He also had to gear up quickly for Adobe Summit the company's annual customer event that was set to start in March in Las Vegas.

Covid-19 changed his plans entirely. Chakravarthy who had spent the previous six years as CEO of Informatica canceled all travel and started working from his living room sofa. He spent so much time on video meetings from there that co-workers turned his couch into a meme.

Chakravarthy also missed his chance to meet Tom Brady who was scheduled to be a guest speaker at the Las Vegas summit. Like its tech peers Adobe converted its conference into a virtual event.

Despite all the disruption revenue in the Digital Experience division which includes products for marketing analytics and e-commerce climbed 12% last year. And in the first quarter sales increased 24% to $934 million accounting for close to a quarter of the company's total revenue. It's the company's second-biggest business behind digital media which includes the Acrobat family of products.

Over a year into his new gig Chakravarthy is now preparing for the virtual 2021 summit next week. He's also getting ready for an eventual return to the office and a chance to meet many more of the company's 23000 worldwide employees in person.

Chakravarthy sat down with CNBC via video from his home in Silicon Valley to talk about the past year and what lies ahead as the pandemic comes to an end.

Here's the full Q&A:

(This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.)

Ari Levy CNBC: You started right before the pandemic hit. What was it like being thrown into the fire like that?

Anil Chakravarthy EVP and GM Adobe's digital experience business and worldwide field operations: We had about two months of typical onboarding we had our employee meetings and I was on the road with customers and partners at our key sites around the world. We were just getting ready to go up to Seattle to meet one of our partners Microsoft  and I had another road trip planned in March. This was early March. First we put a stop to travel. Then we said people don't come into the office. Then it became complete work from home.

The big pivot was this event. It was supposed to be in Las Vegas. We were expecting 23000 people. We had everything lined up. I was looking forward to meeting Tom Brady on stage.

We redirected the entire stage to go from Las Vegas to come to our office so we could record in the office. That plan went through the window. Finally we all ended up recording from home and made the entire event virtual. That was our first real hey this is a digital-only world now. Everybody came face to face with that. We went from digital as an important channel to digital as the primary channel to in many cases digital only. That was the pattern we saw across industries. Since we had an early exposure to that we engaged with a lot of customers and worked with them on that over the course of the year.

Were you supposed to interview Brady on stage?

Tom had his own cameo role. I would introduce him and Tom would do his thing — that was the plan. It became a video thing. The video ended up really nice. He was more produced than it was for me at home.

What became your top job when the pandemic hit as far as supporting employees and working with customers?

For employees the top job just became what do we do for their well-being and safety? There were things that we never would have thought about. Employees were all over the place. There were people with health issues people who just don't have enough room to work at home. In places like in India we have employees who live in relatively small apartments and multi-generational households and things like that. There was a whole range of issues. Some people were super happy that everybody was working remote. Some were like oh my God I don't think I can get my job done.

We had people who were going into data centers and doing things where they couldn't travel to data centers any more or to customer sites to deliver projects. There was a spectrum of events that we had to deal with to make sure that we were delivering a continuous service. We do trillions of transactions a month online. What happened was the volume really went up like crazy. Every day seemed like Black Friday. The key was how do you help this wide variety of employees with different functional roles and different personal situations really stay effective using a complete virtual environment.

On the customer side I would put it into two classes. There was a class who were severely financially impacted especially in the travel and hospitality verticals. For them it was like hey work with us and become a long-term partner so we can get through this and continue to invest in Adobe. The other was like hey finance is not the problem but we never anticipated we would be in this kind of situation. A retailer that was experimenting with digital is now like nobody is coming to store the website is it and I have to stand up curbside pickup in four weeks. How do I do that? It was mostly going into both a consultative role but also a role where we could really work with them as a partner while keeping our business healthy.

You're from India as is your CEO Shantanu Narayen. You mentioned employees in India specifically. What was the response there and how did you help employees get comfortable with the situation?

First of all we helped people with arrangements for how to work from home. In our intranet we actually had a very useful set of collected best practices advice from employees. There were these little mini networks you could follow. If you're a young parent and you have young kids at home what are some things you can do that would help you become more effective while working form home? There was a separate network of people who would share tips about what they were doing. If you were living in a multigenerational household what would you do? if you are in an engineering role versus a customer support role where you have to be aligned with customers' time zones while working from home what would you do? Those were some of challenges especially with customer delivery of projects.

All of our customers who would typically be in an office situation they're working remote. How do you make sure you have all the permissions and the access to help them deliver those projects? What proved really successful for us was there was a set of things we did to make everybody effective like tools to work from home which a lot of companies did. In addition we then had these specific colleague affinity groups of employees who could really based on their role and their personal situation find advice to make their own situation more effective at working from home.

Did you have to send hot spots to people who had weak internet connections?

What proved very effective is Adobe made an allowance. You could expense a certain amount of money and you could use it for whatever you wanted as long as it was reasonably justified. Some people used it to buy office furniture and some people used it for better internet and things like that. We had that open for six months or so.

When you arrived at Adobe what was the high-level expectation?

The experience cloud is the business I'm responsible for. Also for our enterprise customers we have a sales team that will cover all of Adobe. I'm responsible for the enterprise go to market team as well which is not only experience cloud because we want to represent all of Adobe to our enterprise customers.

In terms of the experience cloud we've been investing in this now for well over 10 years starting with the acquisition of Omniture. We're the clear leader in providing the customer experience. The nature of how customers provide this customer experience is changing rapidly so it's much more data driven. It's driven off a common understanding for the customer. Think of it as a unified profile of the customer and then how we deliver content to the customer how we help them do online commerce how we market to them.

It's all being driven off this common platform the data-driven platform. That by the way is what made Adobe successful. The Adobe transformation was the result of moving online and really driving the personalized journey with customers. We call that our data-driven operating model. How do we make that available to all of our customers? Coming from Informatica which is where I was before I had that background in enterprise and driving data-driven platforms. That was my charter was how do we accelerate that journey. We're making good progress on that front.

What was it like for you working from home?

I have a couch behind me that you can see. I was sitting on the couch before I got this — using my allowance I got this desk and everything. The couch became very famous inside the company because I think people are bored and everything became a meme including my couch. I don't why it became a meme. I was just sitting on the couch. I guess not too many people sit on the couch all day. It became like hey he's on the couch again.

Our chief human resources officer has a Dr. Fauci bobblehead behind her. So that became a big meme. This couch became a meme. If I could explain memes I'm telling you I'd be in a different line of work.

Now I have this standing desk. It's a nice setup. Somebody from the security team brought my office monitor and everything here. I waited like six months. I was fighting it.

Now that we're over a year into the pandemic how much of your job is still dealing with personal issues and making sure people are OK?

A good 10-20% of my job is that a coach and consultant and sounding board and just being able to help people work through that. One of the good things we've been able to do is for several of the people who are here and are open to it I go for a walking one on one. We mask up and go for a walk. That's provided a nice way to balance both the human aspect of life with what we're trying to get done at work. I do about three or so a week typically during workday evenings and sometimes over the weekend.

Did you find yourself front and center at the company faster than you expected because of Covid?

The digital experience is a big business and we have lots of employees. The part that was a little bit unexpected was I had not had the chance to meet in person as many people as I would have otherwise met. We had a whole lineup of international events. Our summit events once we do the one in Las Vegas we do them in many markets around the world. I had decided that I would travel to those events and that would give me a chance to meet our employees and customers in the regions. All of that became virtual. The good news is virtually I've met a ton of employees and a ton of customers. That has worked really well.

Typically when you go into a new company or you take over a new role within company as part of doing that job you get a lot of incidental contact. You meet employees and customers in situations where you just have a lot of casual conversations and you pick up a lot of things about what's really going on and what are the issues they face in doing their jobs. That incidental contact is much harder to create in an online environment. I had to work around that. It doesn't happen naturally. I have to work at making it happen.

What 's been the biggest surprise for you?

The biggest positive surprise has been the resiliency of our company and the employees and how they've worked around these constraints. With 23000 people we support trillions of transactions. The volume has really gone through the roof. It's been crazy. Being able to keep all of that up and running and scaling working in a virtual environment the resiliency required when people are scrambling and trying to make sure they're taking care of their families and themselves and so on.

The surprise we're continuing to work on is from a customer perspective things have changed. Customers have also done a really good job of pivoting for the most part. But it's not done. Right now as everybody starts to think about the future of work that's the unknown that we're all working through.

Where are we now in the reopening of the economy and returning to work?

We're at the beginning of that process of reentering and coming back. Everybody is thinking it through and figuring out what's the right way to do it the right pace to do it at and what should be required and what should be recommended in terms of employees and customers. We just had our employee meeting and there were lots of questions about that. We have been doing a lot of — our HR team working with our facilities team — has done a lot of work both our own surveys and our own thought leadership but also comparing notes with our peer companies on what this future of work will look like and within the Adobe employee base what people would like to do.

We do believe that this idea of working from home for some portion of the week is going to stay as the norm for a large number of employees. The piece that we are moving to is hey there are certain types of activities where we will require people to be in the office because that's more productive. That's brainstorming about new products for example or key planning sessions and things like that. As more people get vaccinated that gets easier.

I went into the office to record my session for [the] summit. We were super duper careful. I got tested that morning and made sure everybody got tested before going in. Some of that might continue and some of that might get relaxed.

Give me a little more detail on this year's summit and how how it will be different from last year.

We have Albert Bourla CEO of Pfizer  doing a fireside chat with Shantanu. We also have the COO of FedEx . One as a partner but they've also had a huge role in the pandemic distributing vaccine. This year we have Serena Williams. I know I'm not meeting her this time so there's no let down unlike last year. We have hundreds of customers and lots of partners. We expect that we'll have well over a half-million attendees virtually.

What we've learned from last year to this year is how to really personalize it at scale. Last year because we moved so quickly it was like we made the content we put it out there and people came. It was all in a couple weeks. This time we opened up registration a while ago and people have indicated what they want. We know what they're interested in based on our relationships with them. It's a lot more targeted a lot more personalized and essentially built from the ground up to be a digital experience.

Finally how did you meet Shantanu and did her personally recruit you?

Informatica was a partner of Adobe's. At that time Informatica was a partner for the Adobe Experience platform especially in the data integration space. It was complementary. That's how I met Shantanu. A lot of the reason I came was the opportunity to work with him and work with the leadership team at Adobe.

While the app was originally met with mixed reviews a steady stream of updates and tweaks has turned Adobe's mobile experience into a compelling option for creatives. And now a new all-in-one subscription plan has arrived to make it even more tempting.

The new Adobe Design Mobile Bundle brings together four of Adobe's best mobile apps including Photoshop and Illustrator along with 100GB of Creative Cloud storage (for other storage options see this guide to the best cloud storage out there).

""In the development of all successful technologies there comes a tipping point — a moment when technology design availability and an understanding of the needs of the market all mature and that technology suddenly seems not only viable but inevitable"" says Adobe's Scott Belsky in a blog post introducing the new plan. ""I believe we are at that tipping point now with mobile creative tools.""

The bundle knocks a huge 50% off the cost of each individual app coming in at $14.99 per month or $149.99 per year. At present the deal appears to be limited to the US (but those in EMEA can take advantage of the brilliant 20% off All Apps Plan above).

With no access to the desktop versions of apps like Photoshop and Illustrator the Design Mobile Bundle won't be for everyone. But if you're a creative who mainly works on an iPad 50% off is a pretty sweet deal.

Black-centered stories are finding fertile and profitable ground on screens across Asia judging by the success in the region of blockbuster movies like Marvel’s Black Panther and Disney-Pixar’s Oscar-nominated Soul. Netflix’s newest Japanese anime series set to debut globally on April 29 hopes to ride this wave. Based on a true story Yasuke shines a spotlight on the remarkable rags-to-riches tale of Japan’s first Black samurai.

Although Yasuke is a forgotten and fabled figure his real-life journey from stolen slave to star samurai is ripe for Hollywood.

Little is known about Japan’s first foreign samurai one of only nine. But historians believe Yasuke was abducted from his home—some speculate present-day Mozambique—and auctioned off to the Italian Jesuit priest Alessandro Valignano during the 16th century.

When Yasuke arrived on the shores of Kyoto at 24 or 25 years old as Father Valignano’s slave and personal bodyguard onlookers fought to get a glimpse of the first African to ever step foot in the country. According to letters from Portuguese missionary Luis Frois and a 17th-century book called The History of the Church of Japan cited in an account of Yasuke by Japanese historian Tetsushi Furukawa Yasuke was a towering 6-foot-2 tall man with skin like an “ox” or “charcoal.” Even servants tried to scrub the “black ink” off of him. Eventually his stature caught the attention of warlord Oda Nobunaga who promoted him to the sacred samurai class the highest-ranking social caste in war-torn feudal Japan.

15_SubSub_Key Moment4_YASUKE_04_0017_BRIGHTEN

From 1581 to 1592 Yasuke served Nobunaga who praised his strength describing his might as that of 10 men. But after Nobunaga’s death Japan’s new leaders looked down on Yasuke calling him an “animal” before returning him to the European missionaries and his story was forgotten says Furukawa a history professor at Otani University and editor of the Japan Black Studies Association. He and a group of scholars tried to unearth Yasuke’s buried history but academic records are scant.

That is where Yasuke’s true tale ends and Netflix’s supernatural six-episode series begins. The action-filled anime set in an alternative world of science fiction and fantasy is steeped with magic and robots. The show which took three years to make follows an African samurai warrior who returns to his life of violence in order to protect a mysterious girl from dark forces.

A growing legion of Blerds or Black nerds are praising Yasuke’s arrival. Anime suffers from a “real dearth of Blacks” and “the depictions of Blacks or of people made to resemble Blacks are drawn with exaggerated and imagined physical features of Blackness” says Garrett Washington an assistant professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Washington researches modern and traditional Japan and the broader interplay of race religion and nation in East Asia. He welcomes an anime that draws more nuanced portrayals of Black characters and the array of Black experiences across Japanese society. “There has long been a question of legitimacy of a Black person actually belonging in Japan” he says. “But this kind of historical fiction can help demonstrate that Blacks have been a part of Japan’s history and have their place in Japan just like anyone else.”

The world is watching more anime a $24 billion industry with massive global appeal. Streaming giants HBO Max and Disney+ want a slice of that pie too. Just last year Netflix invested hundreds of millions and dedicated an entire creative team to the genre. According to Netflix more than 100 million households around the globe watched at least one anime title on its service in 2020 up by 50 percent from the year before.

Yasuke is also well-positioned to move beyond the silver screen. A live-action film was slated to star Black Panther’s Chadwick Boseman before the late actor’s untimely death. The movie project is now scrapped but the legend and lore of Yasuke could still live to fight another day.

Do you know where it is?” (Courtesy of NOlympics LA)

“I realized quickly [after moving in] that it’s bad to say anything to Simone. You don’t know what you’re gonna say that’s going to get you in trouble. I don’t know what I’m going to say to her that would be misconstrued.”

Now Brett* is worried. He wants to move out soon but he dreads what the conversation with his landlord Simone Shah will be like when he asks for his security deposit back. He has to run back all correspondences to see if anything he’s ever said could be used against him.

And that’s the smallest stressor when it comes to living in one of Shah’s buildings. A renter in one building discovered that she had compromised the privacy and physical safety of each tenant as every one of their doors had the same lock.

Shah and others take a multipronged approach to maximizing profits which means ignoring tenant requests delaying repairs to maintain uninhabitable conditions hiring lawyers to send intimidating letters as a means of pressuring them out and turning what used to be long-term housing into Airbnbs for tourists. These violations will only increase if we don’t do something about them now; the Olympics struck up an official partnership with Airbnb that will extend through LA28.

Los Angeles turns a blind eye to landlords who set up Airbnbs; this is particularly concerning when they fly under the radar with illegally-operated ones – a practice that is almost guaranteed to increase because of the Airbnb-Olympics deal. Because the City abets speculative real estate corporate and “mom and pop” landlords have made it a common practice to flip residential units into short-term rentals. While “home-sharing” is often presented as an innocent means for everyday people to supplement their income by sharing a room in their own living space as of 2015 nearly 90% of Airbnb profit in Los Angeles comes from people renting out entire units and leasing companies renting out two or more units. In other words: landlords have figured out that the most profitable Airbnbs are the ones that sit completely empty when not used by tourists. This incentivizes landlords and leasing companies to displace long-term tenants so that the units are always vacant.

In this pursuit of easy money landlords are exacerbating the city’s homelessness crisis by converting homes into backdoor hotels. There are approximately 66436 people experiencing houselessness in LA County but currently 39486 Airbnb rentals sit vacant most of the year.

An organized front against illegal Airbnbs is growing concurrently with our work to build tenant power. Locks On My Block built by NOlympicsLA and the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project is a tool to help renters report and track illegal short-term vacation rentals and apartment rentals in Los Angeles that are listed with companies like Airbnb Vrbo Flipkey and Tripping.com. As a website it maps listings and tenant stories submitted by the public who have spotted these units in their buildings or neighborhoods. The larger campaign serves to empower tenant alliances and unions in their fight for protection from landlord harassment.

Since July 2019 Los Angeles has banned any short-term (30-day or less) leases of a unit that is not a leaser’s primary place of residence. This ordinance is sound and necessary but there is a lack of will from LA officials to hold landlords accountable. Furthermore privately owned companies such as Airbnb are able to move faster than local legislation; they are not in the business of any meaningful self-regulation. This leaves tenants wholly unprotected.

Yvette* is a tenant who also lives in one of Shah’s buildings; their apartment is close to Brett’s in Central Los Angeles. Prior to signing Simone had never disclosed to them that any of the units in the building were being rented out as Airbnbs. Yvette eventually found out when a friend discovered that she was not able to rent an available unit because Simone told her it’s being used to host guests.

“I thought that was pretty suspect because there’s still a pandemic happening” they said.

During their time as a tenant Yvette’s logged numerous instances of Simone’s employees and Airbnb guests coming in and out of the building without masks on to protect people who are immunocompromised or at high risk. In late December when the city enforced a strict stay-at-home mandate to lower the near-18% COVID-19 positivity rate they observed a handful of parties in a neighboring unit. The proof was glaring: her landlord is not interested in creating a habitable place for renters.

“But Shah is a symptom of a larger issue” Yvette said. “LA doesn’t give a fuck about tenants’ rights.”

LA’s ruling class has a lot to gain from Airbnbs. In 2017 City Council rubber-stamped a bid to host the Olympics in 2028 which flew under the radar of the public at the time. Then in 2019 the Olympics announced their official partnership with Airbnb. The agreement seeks to “support the sustainability objectives of the Olympic Movement” by providing “accommodation provisions that will reduce costs for Olympic Games organizers and stakeholders” while minimizing “the need for construction of new accommodation infrastructure for the Olympic Games period.” This partnership has no value to anyone else but the powerful; its underlying message ignores the reality that those who gain from this partnership will accelerate and further incentivize displacement. Any illegally operated Airbnb that gets listed today sets the precedent for how profit-seeking landlords in the future can do whatever they want in their buildings.

A crucial part of NOlympics’ Locks On My Block campaign is to support renters who can identify Airbnbs in their buildings then provide input on how people can fight back. It’s a tenants’ rights issue as much as it is a public health one to have Airbnb listings all throughout the city in the middle of a pandemic. And especially in a city where tenants’ rights are not protected and landlords are pardoned Locks On My Block is a chance to uplift perspectives from the other side of exploitative homestays and vacation rentals.

Shah is a real estate investor. Under her company name Dwell Management she has managed over 25 properties in the City since 2019. Many of Shah’s Airbnb hotels are listed on Locks On My Block’s map; from Boyle Heights to East Hollywood her sprawl reaches into neighborhoods that are reeling from gentrification and developmentalism.

In 2015 NPR Marketplace ran an interview with Shah about her portfolio of properties and the pressure of “outside sources of money” to raise rent on long term residents. The interview was titled “York & Fig: Confessions of an Ambivalent Landlord.” In it she takes the reporter through one of her properties in Highland Park points at one of the units then comments that she thinks the tenant doesn’t like her very much.

Several years later apartment units in her buildings surfaced on Airbnb listings as reported by her tenants and crowd-sourced reviews of her business. Several of Shah’s tenants have anonymously reported different ways that she has harassed them or their neighbors: illegal entry into rental units verbal intimidation or deflection tactics to disarm tenants when they come to her with complaints and significant stalls in building maintenance – all while vacated units are being spruced up for short-term renters.

“Pretty much every day a construction or maintenance crew is coming and beautifying for Airbnb tenants” Brett said. “These were things that were never addressed before and suddenly they’re painting stuff.”

Meanwhile Brett is still waiting for things inside his own unit to be fixed. For now he is one of the last long-term tenants left in his apartment building. The rest of the units either lie vacant or welcome a steady flow of Airbnb guests. He wonders whether he will even make it long enough to leave on his own accord at the end of his lease.

Brett and Yvette are just two of a handful of tenants who have spoken to NOlympics about Shah’s pattern of harassing and degrading them. Alongside her use of a lawyer and slow response to maintenance requests multiple renters have shared similar experiences about her tactics to get out of obligations to them. Many of them have been subject to long harassing correspondences from her through email or text. When pressed Shah has used language that blames them for issues in the apartment and suggests that it is harmful to her children for tenants to ask her for basic habitability repairs.

Who does it benefit to make short-term vacation stays and apartment hotels a hot commodity? Speculative real estate and the bloated power of companies like Airbnb are certainly never on the side of LA residents. For every Shah who paints herself as a good “real estate investor” there are plenty of renters who have been subject to the actions of anyone but. There is no such thing as an “ambivalent landlord” as long as anyone is scaring people out of their homes to rake in profit. Anyone who is hoarding residential units is making a clear statement that they are in the business of hurting people and gutting our communities.

Pink kitchens wallpaper with herons or polka dots or cheetahs and bathrooms bathed in black beckon travelers to step outside of the ordinary and try something bold — something adventuresome! Today Morgan talks to StyleBlueprint about her journey from law to design and back again.

How did you find your way to becoming an Airbnb host?

I always knew I wanted to go to law school. While I was in college I had a roommate and close friend named Brooxie Davis. Through the years she encouraged me to think outside the box and to not stick to the status quo. In 2015 Brooxie was diagnosed with cancer so in 2016 I quit my law practice to spend time with her working our way through a bucket list.

My grandfather a former homebuilder and investor approached me during this time and said “Now that you’ve quit your job let’s come up with a way for you to generate income.” He took me to the street where he had purchased his first investment home. There was a house that looked terrible for sale on that street. I bought my first house as well as the two houses next door to it so my first purchase was actually three houses in a row!

Brooxie encouraged me in this by saying “Morgan you’re going to be the person to change Memphis.” Two weeks later my dear friend passed away. That was a really dark period for me. I lost my purpose but I remembered the truth that Brooxie had spoken over my life. Some of my granddad’s friends suggested that I consider turning those three homes into Airbnbs. Since they knew the industry they taught me how to make that happen. I have always had a passion for interior design so this was a way for me to use my creative side. The first house I purchased was the one named “Brooxie’s House” and I have custom wallpaper in “Brooxie’s House” with excerpts from her journal. It was a labor of love and took me a long time.

I missed law so in the time after Brooxie died I opened my own law firm. I wanted to be in control of my own schedule so that I could move back and forth between the Airbnb business and the law firm. Owning both enabled me to do that.

Five years in now we like to do special events through Pettigrew Adventures to highlight good things about Memphis. We just finished our Press Trip which is where we invite people from other cities who may consider visiting Memphis to visit and we aim to show them the best of the best.

How many properties do you have and where are they located?

I currently own nine properties and they are all in Midtown.

How have your Airbnb management methods evolved from the first house you purchased to the ninth?

These days I take a little more risk. At first I spent less money on decor and had less on the walls. I was told people are rough on decor — don’t do rugs don’t do curtains. So my first house wasn’t what it could have been. I learned over time that I was able to charge a higher price and was also able to express myself more through design if I put in the houses what I wanted. I also figured out how to cater to people and how to have better customer service. We have a lot of St. Jude families who come to stay and I want my homes to be warm and inviting for them and for all of my guests. I would say I have grown with each house I’ve done.

Where are most of your visitors from?

Some are international but mostly our guests are American right now. They are often from New York California Chicago and other major cities and are passing through Memphis. Sometimes they are from surrounding areas like Little Rock St. Louis and Birmingham.

I have found an interesting niche. In my law practice I specialize in contract drafting and breach of contract litigation estate planning landlord/tenant-related things and business consulting. I am the lawyer for most major names in the Memphis wedding business including venues photographers videographers florists wedding planners and so on. Because of those law relationships my clients point their wedding parties to Pettigrew Adventures. Our decor provides a fantastic backdrop for photos and getting ready for the wedding pics.

Do you enjoy your law practice or your Airbnb business the same or one more than the other?

I am able to enjoy both because I don’t get bogged down with either. This is my seventh year practicing law. I have other friends who started when I did and they are already burned out. I only take cases I am passionate about and believe in. I love that for all sorts of lawyer-nerd reasons but I also love my clients and go above and beyond for them. Pettigrew Firm prides itself on being proven passionate and personal. I want to show people that lawyers aren’t all bad people. We have a commitment to talk to everyone who calls us within 24 hours of the first inquiry. I believe that integrity gets you the big things in life.

At the same time interior design doesn’t feel like work for me. I’m glad to have that creative outlet and I’m always picking up ideas and asking my team how we can bring that to Memphis. I truly think I wouldn’t want law without my Airbnb business or vice versa.

How are you looking to grow Pettigrew Adventures?

Right now I’m thinking in some new directions. I have recently taught some friends who moved away from Memphis but didn’t want to sell their home how to design it and get it started as an Airbnb. I’m considering hosting a master class on this very thing. In addition I’m considering featuring other people’s homes under my brand. This would be for people who don’t want the headache of getting it all ready but they just want the passive income. I would help them design and furnish their house and they would get the Pettigrew Adventures reputation with more than 1000 five-star reviews. We are always thinking about expanding beyond Memphis but at this point that’s still in the works.

What is the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?

Concrete plans are garbage. When you have them you miss opportunities simply because they weren’t part of your plan. You become successful when you remain open to new ideas. You can’t just be smart. That isn’t enough. Smartness gets you a cubicle in the corner and good performance reviews. Personality creativity and integrity get you the big things in life.

Aside from faith family and friends what are three things you can’t live without?

Colorful wallpaper traveling to new places and my dogs. Runner-ups: Coconut La Croix pizza and good music!

“The whole saying ‘It’s lonely at the top’ is really true” says Mike Malefakis Wharton’s former executive education CEO and associate vice dean. Even though he recognizes this reality Malefakis also champions the value of continuing education for execs.

These programs provide an opportunity for connecting learning and growing with others holding C-suite positions. The programs freshen up your leadership approaches and some even offer a sabbatical from typical work life.

Many of the nation’s top business schools offer courses and programs tailored for executives that align with leaders’ demanding schedules. Below are 10 executive leadership management programs (some all-online hybrid or all in-person) tailored for the C-suite covering topics including risk management competition and brand reputation.

The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania

C-suite life means long workdays yet little time to reflect and learn from others. “That’s why the five weeks is critical to almost take a sabbatical from what you’re doing on a regular daily basis and invest in yourself” Malefakis says. During the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania‘s five-week on-campus Advanced Management Program you’ll attend breakout sessions simulations and experiential learning (think: team rowing exercises to practice communication and coordination) with fellow execs. You’ll leave with a methodology to pause reflect learn then act in future business situations. Wharton also offers a hybrid version of the program in which executives make two bookend trips to Philadelphia and complete online courses. Both the on-campus and hybrid options cost $65000.

Stanford University Graduate School of Business

The Black Leaders Program at Stanford Graduate School of Business is tailored for Black business leaders or those executives looking to advance Black leadership. The weeklong program focuses on race and leadership power negotiations relationships communication and networking. The in-person program also provides a space to discuss barriers to leadership and Black identity in the workplace. Following the sessions you’ll work on a capstone project focused on career advancement with peer coaching and feedback along the way. Program director Brian S. Lowery’s research focuses on perceptions of inequity and how to reduce it. The Black Leaders Program costs $13500 to attend and you’ll receive a certificate of completion at the conclusion.

MIT Sloan School of Management

Before diving into Closing the Gap Between Strategy and Execution a two-day in-person course you’ll complete a survey to evaluate whether your organization has been successful with strategy execution and to pinpoint improvement opportunities. The course at MIT Sloan School of Management is taught from the perspective that strategy execution relies heavily on risk management rather than on implicit beliefs. You’ll use situations from your own business experiences to apply ideas learned from the course which treats strategy as a cyclical process. The course intended for executives of companies with at least $30 million in annual revenue is led by Donald Sull who was deemed a management guru by Fortune. Closing the Gap costs $4900 to attend and is a fit for executives including CEOs and chief strategy officers.

The Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University

Kellogg’s yearlong Women’s Senior Leadership Program for top women leaders includes four three-day sessions focused on decision making negotiation skills ethical challenges and external management.

Leadership consultants provide check-ins throughout the year to help set your development goals and follow progress. Graduates of the program are CEOs CFOs CMOs and presidents of organizations. Participants pay $26150 to attend which includes lodging and meals.

You’ll also work on a management action plan project to take back to your organization. Projects could be focused on addressing business challenges or new growth opportunities. “At the end of the day it’s really all about impact” says Phil Barta executive director of Tuck Executive Education at Dartmouth. “That’s what these organizations are looking to see from their leaders when they send them.” Tuck’s Advanced Management Program costs $24000.

University of Virginia Darden School of Business

The Executive Program: Strategic Leadership at the Top hosted by the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business includes in-person modules and online sessions on topics ranging from strategy to personal wellness entrepreneurship and risk management. While all participants of this six-month program are senior leaders they come from backgrounds spanning financial services government education health care—and even aerospace. “You open your mind to different ways of doing things and how people live and think” says Elton “Neil” Wright Jr. a program quality executive with Boeing who participated in the program adding that TEP gave him a better sense of the world economy. You’ll meet in person over two two-week sessions in Charlottesville Virginia. The Executive Program costs $39950 to attend and graduates can receive a discount on further executive education courses at Darden.

Harvard Business School

Harvard Business School‘s weeklong in-person course Risk Management for Corporate Leaders: From Compliance to Competitive Advantage teaches participants to anticipate and mitigate risk and use risk management for strategizing and competitive advantage.

Execs from Johnson & Johnson Netflix and Accenture are past participants. Harvard recommends that multiple company representatives attend the course at one time. Pricing for this year’s program offering is to be determined.

Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson just made history at the 2021 Oscars. The pair are the first Black women to win an Academy Award for hair and makeup. They were recognized for their work in Netflix's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Neal served as the film's hair department lead while Wilson is star Viola Davis's personal hairstylist. Davis was also nominated for Best Actress for her role in the Netflix film.

While tonight was a landmark moment the pair already made history in March when they became the first Black women to be nominated in the hair and makeup category.

""I want to say thank you to our ancestors who put the work in [and] were denied but never gave up"" Neal said in her acceptance speech. ""I also stand here as Jamika and I break this glass ceiling with so much excitement for the future because I can picture Black trans women standing up here. And Asian sisters. And our Latina sisters. And indigenous women. And I know that one day it won't be unusual or groundbreaking. It will just be normal.""

Recently live captioning came to Chrome desktop and we also saw the read later feature come to Android. One of the latest features might not seem so exciting but I've found it to be such a productivity hack especially when sharing relevant information with friends and family. What is this new feature? It's the ability to share links to highlighted text in Google Chrome and I'll show you how simple and intuitive it is to use.

How to link highlighted text from Google Chrome

From your Chrome browser select a bit of text that you want to share a direct link to. Right-click on the text. Select the Copy Link to Highlight option.

Source: Android Central (Image credit: Source: Android Central)

Share that link with somone and/or paste it into another browser tab or window.

Source: Android Central (Image credit: Source: Android Central)

You or the person you share the link with should be taken directly to the highlighted text on the page in question. This feature is supported in Chrome version 90 and later and should also work in updates to Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers. While those using other browsers like Safari won't be able to take advantage of this feature they will still be able to visit the page of the text you highlighted when you share one of these links with them.

This feature has started rolling out to desktop browsers Chromebooks and Android and iOS devices. If you have updated to version 90 and still don't see the option to share links to highlighted text you can manually enable it in Chrome's flag settings. Here's how.

How to turn on the copy link to text flag

From your Chrome browser type in chrome://flags into the address bar.

Source: Android Central (Image credit: Source: Android Central)

Search for Copy Link To Text. From the drop-down menu toggle the setting to Enabled.

At the bottom of the screen click the Relaunch Chrome button.

Once Chrome has relaunched you should then be able to select specific text to share links to.

The number of people trading cryptocurrencies on Robinhood Crypto jumped from just 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to a staggering 9.5 million in the first quarter of 2021.

Massive rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent months has grabbed the public interest. People who stayed away from cryptocurrencies until a few months ago are now learning about them and trading crypto assets.

It gives crypto exchanges - both big and small - an opportunity to attract hundreds of millions of new customers. In the technology sector big players keep getting bigger and the small ones often get acquired or get crushed.

But if the smaller crypto exchanges learn from the market leaders and play their cards well they could very well join the big league in a few years.

Big lessons for small players

Growth marketing and consulting firm BDC Consulting studied the strategies of the world’s top 30 largest crypto exchanges since 2018 to chart out their evolution. It’s a treasure trove for smaller crypto exchanges and other platforms in the same space.

According to the study three of the world’s largest exchanges handled 76.99% of the global crypto trading volume in 2020 up from 55.51% in 2019. The trend looks intimidating. However a closer look at data suggests it could be a positive sign for the smaller players.

The crypto ecosystem is still in its infancy with a long runway for growth. The chart above shows that the players at the top keep changing depending on how aggressively they expand their customer base.

Houbi was nowhere on the list in 2018 but became even bigger than Binance in 2020. In contrast Bitfinex skidded from 14.38% market share in 2018 to just 0.69% in 2020.

International expansion

According to the study leading players such as Huobi and Binance offer their services in more than a hundred countries. They haven’t kept themselves restricted to just a few markets. Huobi has aggressively expanded to more than 130 countries while Binance operates in over 180 countries.

Focusing on a single market could shut a company out of the other markets. BDC Consulting found that direct traffic accounts for 71% of all visits to the websites of crypto exchanges. Most people bookmark the websites they use or the web browser auto-fills it when people type the first few letters.

Since only 11.5% of traffic comes from search engines it’s imperative for crypto exchanges to quickly acquire as many users as possible and provide them the best experience. That’s how you get the people who join the crypto revolution in the coming months and years to directly visit your site.

Speed and search engines

The study found that only three out of the top 30 crypto exchange websites had a high loading speed on both mobile and desktop. Since loading speed is a key element of user experience Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL)boosts rankings for websites that load faster. Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool allows developers to analyze the website load speed.

Though search engines account for only 11.5% of traffic to the top 30 crypto exchanges’ websites it’s still a significant amount considering the total number of crypto-related search queries could be in hundreds of millions.

BDC Consulting said that only 34% of crypto exchanges have properly optimized their websites for search engines. The rest are depriving themselves of the opportunity to acquire new customers.

Insights on Social Media

Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) is the primary channel of communication for all the leading exchanges. On average a crypto exchange had 196000 followers on Twitter at the end of 2020. The engagement rate on Twitter increased slightly from 0.07% in 2018 to 0.08% in 2020.

The top 30 crypto exchanges were posting 3 times a day on Twitter.

Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) was another preferred medium of communication for the exchanges. Binance and KuCoin were posting 7 times a day on Facebook in 2020. Others were posting only once or twice a day.

BDC Consulting added that the posting frequency depends on whether you have something newsworthy to say. Bombarding the audience with irrelevant content is a terrible social media strategy.

Crypto exchanges have doubled down on YouTube. They were posting only 2.3 videos per month on average in 2018. But the posting frequency has almost doubled to 4.3 videos a month in 2020. Also only three of the top 30 exchanges had listed their YouTube channels on their website in 2018. Now the number is 16.

Here’s the year-on-year growth in their subscribers:

However the engagement rate on YouTube has declined from 0.51% in 2018 to just 0.19% in 2020.

Thomas Vinterberg's win at the 93rd Academy Awards wouldn't have been possible without help from his late daughter Ida.

Vinterberg 51 accepted the Oscar for Best International Feature Film at Sunday's live awards show for Another Round starring Mads Mikkelsen.

The director dedicated his win to Ida who was killed in a car accident in 2019 at age 19.

""Four days into shooting the impossible happened"" Vinterberg said during his acceptance speech. ""An accident on a highway took my daughter away someone looking into a cell phone. And we miss her and I love her.""

Vinterberg grew emotional first holding back tears before allowing them to fall as he recalled Ida's talent and help in perfecting her father's screenplay.

""Two months before it we shot this movie and two months before she died she was in Africa"" he said. ""She wrote me a letter she had just read the script and she was glowing with excitement. She loved this she felt seen by this she was supposed to be in this.""

ABC

""If anyone dares to believe she's here with us now you'd be able to see her clapping and cheering with us"" he continued. ""We ended up making this movie for her as her monument.""

He added ""So Ida this is a miracle that just happened and you're a part of this miracle. Maybe you've been pulling some strings somewhere but this one's for you.""

Ida was set to make her screen debut in her father's film playing Mikkelsen's teenage daughter. Another Round follows Mikkelsen's character — a disillusioned high school history teacher who confronts his midlife crisis through day drinking.

In December Vinterberg told IndieWire ""my life was destroyed"" following Ida's death.

""We were very close. She always told me the honest truth"" he said at the time. ""It did not make sense to continue but it did not make sense not to continue. She would've hated that. So we decided to make the movie for her. That was the only way we could do this.""

He shot part of the film in Ida's high school where he ""felt a combination of indescribable pain and love.""

Recently live captioning came to Chrome desktop and we also saw the read later feature come to Android. One of the latest features might not seem so exciting but I've found it to be such a productivity hack especially when sharing relevant information with friends and family. What is this new feature? It's the ability to share links to highlighted text in Google Chrome and I'll show you how simple and intuitive it is to use.

How to link highlighted text from Google Chrome

From your Chrome browser select a bit of text that you want to share a direct link to. Right-click on the text. Select the Copy Link to Highlight option.

Source: Android Central (Image credit: Source: Android Central)

Share that link with somone and/or paste it into another browser tab or window.

Source: Android Central (Image credit: Source: Android Central)

You or the person you share the link with should be taken directly to the highlighted text on the page in question. This feature is supported in Chrome version 90 and later and should also work in updates to Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers. While those using other browsers like Safari won't be able to take advantage of this feature they will still be able to visit the page of the text you highlighted when you share one of these links with them.

This feature has started rolling out to desktop browsers Chromebooks and Android and iOS devices. If you have updated to version 90 and still don't see the option to share links to highlighted text you can manually enable it in Chrome's flag settings. Here's how.

How to turn on the copy link to text flag

From your Chrome browser type in chrome://flags into the address bar.

You don't have to use a Chromebook to enable these new Chrome 90 settings but the nice thing about Chrome OS is that its devices get updates automatically and quickly. Even after a year we still think that the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is the best chromebook for most people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaWctdGhyZWUtY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlcy1oYW5kbGUtMTcxNzU1OTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Three Crypto Exchanges Handle 77% Of Global Trading Volume Says New BDC Consulting Study,"As the big keep getting bigger the consulting firm offers insights into how smaller crypto exchanges can thrive despite the competition.

The number of people trading cryptocurrencies on Robinhood Crypto jumped from just 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to a staggering 9.5 million in the first quarter of 2021.

Massive rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent months has grabbed the public interest. People who stayed away from cryptocurrencies until a few months ago are now learning about them and trading crypto assets.

It gives crypto exchanges - both big and small - an opportunity to attract hundreds of millions of new customers. In the technology sector big players keep getting bigger and the small ones often get acquired or get crushed.

But if the smaller crypto exchanges learn from the market leaders and play their cards well they could very well join the big league in a few years.

Big lessons for small players

Growth marketing and consulting firm BDC Consulting studied the strategies of the world’s top 30 largest crypto exchanges since 2018 to chart out their evolution. It’s a treasure trove for smaller crypto exchanges and other platforms in the same space.

According to the study three of the world’s largest exchanges handled 76.99% of the global crypto trading volume in 2020 up from 55.51% in 2019. The trend looks intimidating. However a closer look at data suggests it could be a positive sign for the smaller players.

The crypto ecosystem is still in its infancy with a long runway for growth. The chart above shows that the players at the top keep changing depending on how aggressively they expand their customer base.

Houbi was nowhere on the list in 2018 but became even bigger than Binance in 2020. In contrast Bitfinex skidded from 14.38% market share in 2018 to just 0.69% in 2020.

International expansion

According to the study leading players such as Huobi and Binance offer their services in more than a hundred countries. They haven’t kept themselves restricted to just a few markets. Huobi has aggressively expanded to more than 130 countries while Binance operates in over 180 countries.

Focusing on a single market could shut a company out of the other markets. BDC Consulting found that direct traffic accounts for 71% of all visits to the websites of crypto exchanges. Most people bookmark the websites they use or the web browser auto-fills it when people type the first few letters.

Since only 11.5% of traffic comes from search engines it’s imperative for crypto exchanges to quickly acquire as many users as possible and provide them the best experience. That’s how you get the people who join the crypto revolution in the coming months and years to directly visit your site.

Speed and search engines

The study found that only three out of the top 30 crypto exchange websites had a high loading speed on both mobile and desktop. Since loading speed is a key element of user experience Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL)boosts rankings for websites that load faster. Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool allows developers to analyze the website load speed.

Though search engines account for only 11.5% of traffic to the top 30 crypto exchanges’ websites it’s still a significant amount considering the total number of crypto-related search queries could be in hundreds of millions.

BDC Consulting said that only 34% of crypto exchanges have properly optimized their websites for search engines. The rest are depriving themselves of the opportunity to acquire new customers.

Insights on Social Media

Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) is the primary channel of communication for all the leading exchanges. On average a crypto exchange had 196000 followers on Twitter at the end of 2020. The engagement rate on Twitter increased slightly from 0.07% in 2018 to 0.08% in 2020.

The top 30 crypto exchanges were posting 3 times a day on Twitter.

Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) was another preferred medium of communication for the exchanges. Binance and KuCoin were posting 7 times a day on Facebook in 2020. Others were posting only once or twice a day.

BDC Consulting added that the posting frequency depends on whether you have something newsworthy to say. Bombarding the audience with irrelevant content is a terrible social media strategy.

Crypto exchanges have doubled down on YouTube. They were posting only 2.3 videos per month on average in 2018. But the posting frequency has almost doubled to 4.3 videos a month in 2020. Also only three of the top 30 exchanges had listed their YouTube channels on their website in 2018. Now the number is 16.

Here’s the year-on-year growth in their subscribers:

However the engagement rate on YouTube has declined from 0.51% in 2018 to just 0.19% in 2020.

Thomas Vinterberg's win at the 93rd Academy Awards wouldn't have been possible without help from his late daughter Ida.

Vinterberg 51 accepted the Oscar for Best International Feature Film at Sunday's live awards show for Another Round starring Mads Mikkelsen.

The director dedicated his win to Ida who was killed in a car accident in 2019 at age 19.

""Four days into shooting the impossible happened"" Vinterberg said during his acceptance speech. ""An accident on a highway took my daughter away someone looking into a cell phone. And we miss her and I love her.""

Vinterberg grew emotional first holding back tears before allowing them to fall as he recalled Ida's talent and help in perfecting her father's screenplay.

""Two months before it we shot this movie and two months before she died she was in Africa"" he said. ""She wrote me a letter she had just read the script and she was glowing with excitement. She loved this she felt seen by this she was supposed to be in this.""

""If anyone dares to believe she's here with us now you'd be able to see her clapping and cheering with us"" he continued. ""We ended up making this movie for her as her monument.""

He added ""So Ida this is a miracle that just happened and you're a part of this miracle. Maybe you've been pulling some strings somewhere but this one's for you.""

In December Vinterberg told IndieWire ""my life was destroyed"" following Ida's death.

He shot part of the film in Ida's high school where he ""felt a combination of indescribable pain and love.""

In reality there is a fourth force: the prime minister Narendra Modi and untold numbers of small merchants that support his Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ). As nationalists they naturally side with Reliance which is led by Mukesh Ambani India’s richest man. That makes the battle visceral mixing business politics xenophobia and billionaires.

Before Reliance Retail Mr Ambani’s commercial arm launched its own e-commerce platform last year Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart were the undisputed lords of online selling in India. They invested heavily in technology logistics and payments to build market shares of about 35% each in what is still partly as a result of curbs on their activities by the Modi government a relatively underexploited e-commerce market. Now coinciding with a renewed surge in covid-19 cases in India the risks they face are rising. Lockdowns may favour Reliance Retail especially given the prominence of its online grocery store JioMart. And yet more government efforts to hobble the foreign-owned e-merchants may be on the way. As a result Amazon and Flipkart are themselves having to play politics to defend their interests. It is an unsavoury situation.

In his final letter to shareholders Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos urged a deep dive into musculoskeletal disorders which account for about 40% of work-related injuries across the company and affect millions of workers globally across sectors. It is often synonymous with jobs in manufacturing and places like warehouses. Of course Amazon's treatment of its employees has become a high-profile issue from the recent union battle in an Alabama warehouse to conditions for its essential workers during the pandemic. And it has been cited for a high incidence of workplace injuries in recent years though the company has said in the past that it also reports more workplace incidents than peers due to a more proactive safety culture. ""If you read some of the news reports you might think we have no care for employees"" Bezos wrote in his letter released earlier this month. ""In those reports our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That's not accurate. They're sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work."" But they also do suffer from MSDs that occur on jobs that include what can be described as robot-like repetition. The extended remarks by Bezos about this workplace injury amounted to one of the first announcements by a large corporation to draw broader attention to the issue according to several experts consulted by CNBC. Estimates suggest that MSDs cost U.S. companies over $50 billion each year and resulted in between 21 and 32 days away from work on average between 1997 to 2010 and in addition to Amazon warehouse work MSD issues in meat processing and poultry plants have drawn recent attention.

The CNBC @Work Summit returns On October 13 Michael Dell Ray Dalio Bank of America Chief Operations and Technology Officer Cathy Bessant WeWork Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure Levi Strauss & Co. CFO Harmit Singh and Estee Lauder CFO Tracey Travis will talk building a resilient future and more. Register now.

MSDs often called ""ergonomics injuries"" are typically strains and sprains caused by repetitive motions overexertion or task performance in awkward positions and include issues like carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics retail trade manufacturing and social assistance jobs accounted for 50% of all MSD cases in the private sector. While common in factory-line workplaces and among first-time workers they can also occur through sports desk-work and everyday use. ""MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee's first six months"" Bezos wrote adding that the company launched a program to coach small groups of employees on body mechanics and safety which contributed to a 32% decrease in injuries between 2019 and 2020 while the time away as a result of the injuries ""decreased by more than half"" Bezos said in the recent letter. ""We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time."" Amazon declined to provide additional information on its ongoing MSD efforts to CNBC. While MSD cases in the U.S. workplace have declined over the last decade approximately 1.71 billion people suffer from musculoskeletal conditions globally with lower back pain being the most common occurrence the World Health Organization reported. That number is expected to increase as the population ages and grows. ""Many of these injuries are actually preventable they're not accidents they're things we can work to avoid and make a huge difference to patients"" says Anna Miller vice chair for the department of orthopedic surgery and chief of the orthopedic trauma division at Washington University School of Medicine.

The dangers of repetitive work

While common among manufacturing employees working along the repetitive assembly line they can also occur from sitting in a home office conducting remote work. One of the biggest issues with MSDs is that there's no concrete reason why they occur and they can happen spontaneously from a seemingly menial task like walking up a flight of stairs says John Dony senior director of the National Safety Council. There's little research about how they happen why they occur and who is the most susceptible. While older workers often suffer wear and tear MSDs younger workers often try to ""tough it out"" or fail to understand the risks Dony said. Some studies suggest obesity genetics or smoking can increase the risk of MSDs but the data is not very clear on causal relationships says Andrew N. Pollak senior vice president for clinical transformation and chief of orthopedics at the University of Maryland Medical System. Very limited federal funding is devoted to this research but large corporations like Amazon which now employs over a million workers can better collect information they can share with other companies. ""That kind of research has been difficult to accomplish in smaller companies because you simply don't have the same number of people doing the same jobs as you do at a big behemoth like Amazon"" Pollak says.

MSDs can also lead to mental health issues for many frontline workers and many people continue working even after suffering a strain because they need the money says Miller. In many service-oriented jobs workers feel pressure to continue working to make the customer happy and work through injuries to meet objectives says Jaimo Ahn a professor and associate chair for education in the department of orthopedic surgery at the University of Michigan Health System. ""If you're not reaching your objective or you feel like you aren't where you need to be then you keep going"" Ahn said.

Jeff Bezos recently published his 24th and final annual letter to Amazon shareholders as the company's CEO.

The e-commerce group's founder and future executive chairman has shared his views on invention failure customer obsession long-term thinking and other subjects in his yearly missives. He's also reflected on what he's learned as Amazon's leader and what others can take away from his company's phenomenal success.

Here are Bezos' 25 best quotes from his shareholder letters lightly edited and condensed for clarity:

1. ""This is Day 1 for the Internet and if we execute well for Amazon.com."" (1997)

2. ""It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them 'You can work long hard or smart but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three') but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy."" (1997)

3. ""There is no rest for the weary. I constantly remind our employees to be afraid to wake up every morning terrified. Not of our competition but of our customers. We consider them to be loyal to us – right up until the second that someone else offers them a better service."" (1998)

4. ""We are doubly blessed. We have a market-size unconstrained opportunity in an area where the underlying foundational technology we employ improves every day. That is not normal."" (1999)

5. ""As the famed investor Benjamin Graham said 'In the short term the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it's a weighing machine.' Clearly there was a lot of voting going on in the boom year of '99 — and much less weighing. We have our heads down working to build a heavier and heavier company."" (2000)

6. ""Long-term thinking is both a requirement and an outcome of true ownership. Owners are different from tenants. I know of a couple who rented out their house and the family who moved in nailed their Christmas tree to the hardwood floors instead of using a tree stand. Expedient I suppose and admittedly these were particularly bad tenants but no owner would be so short-sighted. Similarly many investors are effectively short-term tenants turning their portfolios so quickly they are really just renting the stocks that they temporarily 'own.'"" (2003)

7. ""We started by setting ourselves the admittedly audacious goal of improving upon the physical book. We did not choose that goal lightly. Anything that has persisted in roughly the same form and resisted change for 500 years is unlikely to be improved easily."" (2007) — on Amazon's decision to create the Kindle e-reader.

8. ""Missionaries build better products."" (2007)

9. ""At a fulfillment center recently one of our Kaizen experts asked me 'I'm in favor of a clean fulfillment center but why are you cleaning? Why don't you eliminate the source of dirt?' I felt like the Karate Kid."" (2008)

10. ""Start with customers and work backwards. Listen to customers but don't just listen to customers – also invent on their behalf."" (2009)

Advertisement

11. ""Our passion for pioneering will drive us to explore narrow passages and unavoidably many will turn out to be blind alleys. But – with a bit of good fortune – there will also be a few that open up into broad avenues."" (2012)

12. ""A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it it can grow to very large size it has strong returns on capital and it's durable in time – with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these don't just swipe right get married."" (2014)

13. ""Our business model for original content is unique. I'm pretty sure we're the first company to have figured out how to make winning a Golden Globe pay off in increased sales of power tools and baby wipes!"" (2014)

14. ""Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment and if you know in advance that it's going to work it's not an experiment."" (2015)

Advertisement

15. ""Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10. We all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business however is that no matter how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can get is four. In business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score 1000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments."" (2015)

16. ""No matter how good an entrepreneur you are you're not going to build an all-composite 787 in your garage startup – not one you'd want to fly in anyway. (2015) — on the power of scale.

17. ""Many characterized AWS as a bold – and unusual – bet when we started. 'What does this have to do with selling books?' We could have stuck to the knitting. I'm glad we didn't. Or did we? Maybe the knitting has as much to do with our approach as the arena."" (2015) — suggesting Amazon applied the same strategy to cloud services as it did to online retail.

18. ""Our growth has happened fast. 20 years ago I was driving boxes to the post office in my Chevy Blazer and dreaming of a forklift."" (2016)

Advertisement

19. ""Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently accept failures plant seeds protect saplings and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen."" (2016)

20. ""One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It's human nature. We didn't ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way and yesterday's 'wow' quickly becomes today's 'ordinary.'"" (2017)

21. ""The biggest needle-movers will be things that customers don't know to ask for. We have to tap into our own inner imagination about what's possible."" (2018)

22. ""If you had gone to a customer in 2013 and said 'Would you like a black always-on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a Pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions that also turns on your lights and plays music?' I guarantee you they'd have looked at you strangely and said 'No thank you.'"" — underscoring that customers didn't know they wanted Amazon Echo smart speakers until their release. (2018)

23. ""If you want to be successful in business (in life actually) you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn't create value for those it touches even if it appears successful on the surface isn't long for this world. It's on the way out."" (2020)

24. ""We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to 'be yourself.' What I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways it pulls at you. Don't let it happen."" (2020)

25. ""Be kind be original create more than you consume and never never never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1."" (2020)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmV0LmNvbS90ZWNoL2dhbWluZy93aGVyZS10by1idXktdGhlLXhib3gtc2VyaWVzLXgtYW5kLXMtcmVzdG9ja3MtYXQtd2FsbWFydC1hbWF6b24tYmVzdC1idXktdGFyZ2V0LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to buy the Xbox Series X and S: Restocks Walmart Amazon Best Buy Target Microsoft and more,"Gamers who have yet to get their hands on the elusive new Xbox Series X have now endured more than five months of frustration. It's always the same: They log on the moment consoles become available at a major retailer like Amazon Walmart Best Buy GameStop or Target and then the entire stock sells out within seconds and they're left empty-handed. Demand for the Xbox Series X continues to outpace supply partially due to the due to the pandemic which has lots of people looking for entertainment options they can enjoy at home. This is also one of the reasons the PS5 was recently named the fastest-selling console in US history.

But don't give up just yet! You see in recent weeks we've been seeing more frequent inventory drops at major retailers. And the fact that retailers are announcing Series X and Series S restocks at all means that your chances of snagging a new console are getting better. The $500 Xbox Series X is the game console of choice for its 4K video and 120Hz refresh rates but if you don't have a 4K TV the all-digital Xbox Series S is an excellent system and costs a much more reasonable $300.

Andrew Hoyle/CNET

For the latest news on Xbox console inventory updates check back here frequently. You can monitor Xbox availability on your own too: Twitter is a popular (if not entirely reliable) source of Xbox restock rumors. But here at CNET we occasionally get an update directly from retailers and other tipsters about upcoming inventory restocks and when we do we put the word out immediately.

This much is true: It will probably be months before normal Xbox Series X stock inventory levels appear in major retailer stores so if you don't put some effort in getting your own Xbox before summer is likely to be a challenge. Microsoft recently said that it expects inventory to be short through June.

After this list of related stories you'll find a list of all the major retailers (and high-profile resellers) where you can monitor Xbox stock updates and availability.

Xbox Series X Restock Possibilities

Amazon You can find both the Xbox Series X and the less expensive Series S on the same Amazon product page. See at Amazon

GameStop This is the product page for the Xbox Series at GameStop. See at GameStop

Microsoft If you want to get the latest on the Xbox Series X there's probably nowhere better than Microsoft's own Xbox Series X homepage. See at Microsoft

Amazon picked up two Oscars Sunday night during the 93rd Academy Awards as the annual celebration of the best in film took on a more subdued approach because of the pandemic.

Amazon’s wins: Amazon Studios entered the night with 12 nominations including six for “Sound of Metal” the story of a heavy metal drummer who loses his hearing. The film won for sound and film editing before losing out in the best picture and best actor categories where Riz Ahmed was nominated.

Amazon Studio’s “One Night in Miami” and “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” also got multiple nods. Amazon received one nomination last year in the foreign film category and won three Oscars in 2017 — a first for a streaming service.

Streaming success: Netflix entered the night with a leading 36 nominations and walked away with seven Oscars tops among all studios. David Fincher’s “Mank” a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of “Citizen Kane” had 10 nominations and won two awards. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” won for makeup and hairstyling. Netflix also won Oscars for documentary feature (“My Octopus Teacher”); live-action short (“Two Distant Strangers”); and animated short film (“If Anything Happens I Love You”).

Top film: “Nomadland” won a few of the top prizes of the night including best picture. The film stars Frances McDormand as a woman who travels the country in her van interacting with a community of people she meets at various places and jobs — including at an Amazon fulfillment center. McDormand won the best actress prize and Chloé Zhao won for best director. Zhao made history as the first woman of Asian descent and the second woman ever to win best director.

Different look and feel: The ceremony was held at Union Station in Los Angeles rather than the swanky Dolby Theater. Rather than a large audience the in-person crowd consisted mostly of nominees (although some were still virtual) seated at intimate tables. There was no host but there were a series of presenters including Regina King director of Amazon’s Oscar-nominated “One Night in Miami” who opened the show as the first presenter."

Airlines are on the road back to normal and the travel landscape this year is already proving to be a world away from last year during the pandemic's peak.

Air traveler numbers in the US have skyrocketed to over one million passengers per day since March 11 according to the Transportation Security Administration and more Americans will undoubtedly resume flying once they receive their vaccines now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given the green light.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Flying now in many ways is just like it was before the pandemic. Masks are now mandated by federal law but most airlines that blocked middle seats in 2020 have no abandoned the practice while many are restoring amenities like the in-flight snack and drink service.

The summer of vaccinated travel is approaching and those expecting empty flights are going to be disappointed. Crowded flights are common and not all airlines are taking the same measures to keep flyers safe and healthy.

On recent trips in the first quarter of 2021 I set out to fly on as many different US airlines as possible to see how each was adapting to the extended duration of the pandemic.

From ultra-low-cost carriers to the largest airline in the US here's how each ranked in the new year.

7. Frontier Airlines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

Frontier is not blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights. Passengers that don't choose to pay for a seat have one randomly assigned and the airline doesn't appear to be prioritizing spacing.

I was assigned a seat in a crowded row for example when empty rows were available and many took it upon themselves to move rows.

Customer service agents at the airport may allow a free seat change but that all depends on the flight and the agent. Flight attendants aboard the aircraft also may allow a seat change but some prefer to wait until the aircraft is airborne.

Boarding

Frontier boards aircraft from the back to the front in an effort to ensure flyers in the back don't have to walk through a crowded plane. Passengers also must submit to a temperature check before stepping on the plane.

Mask-wearing policies were enforced but many passengers consistently disregarded the rule on a flight I took from Las Vegas to Seattle.

Frontier also does not offer an in-flight snack and beverage service during the pandemic. Bottles of water are available for purchase however for $2.99.

Deplaning

6. American Airlines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

American does not block any seats onboard its aircraft and instead gives flyers an option to change off a flight if it fills up depending on availability on other flights. It's a nice gesture but I've found that this is rarely a dependable alternative since crowded flights are becoming more common and there's no guarantee an emptier flight will remain empty.

Boarding

American still uses its normal boarding procedure where passengers are assigned a group depending on their seat location. The front of the aircraft tends to fill up first forcing passengers to walk through a crowded aircraft to get to their seats.

Basic economy passengers regardless of where they are sitting board in the very last group.

American offers a small in-flight service consisting of a bottle of water sanitary wipe and snack in a sealed bag. The offering is basic but more than nothing.

Deplaning

Southwest no longer limits capacity onboard its aircraft and every seat can be sold. Passengers are also no longer notified of full flights Travel Weekly reported.

Boarding

Southwest has reverted to its normal boarding process where flyers are assigned a boarding group and 30 passengers board at a time. Seats in the front of the plane typically fill up first and flyers head towards empty rows in the back.

Flyers can get in a better boarding group by checking in for their flight exactly 24 hours in advance and then head straight to the back of the plane to avoid other passengers.

JetBlue abandoned back-to-front in March and now uses its normal boarding procedure where passengers are assigned a group depending on their seat location. The front of the aircraft tends to fill up first forcing passengers to walk through a crowded aircraft to get to their seats.

Some JetBlue hubs like New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport have automated boarding gates where flyers don't have to interact with a gate agent. Airports without the technology however operate in the traditional method.

1. Delta Air Lines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

Flying on Delta Air Lines during the pandemic. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Delta is the last major US airline to keep middle seats and some aisle seats blocked. The policy is slated to end on May 1 however when Delta will fill planes to capacity.

Blocking middle seats is a popular selling feature for those flying for the first time since the pandemic began and Delta kept it going the longest. I could always breathe easier when flying Delta knowing I wouldn't have a seat neighbor.

The airline has encroached on the policy however when needed to rebook passengers from canceled flights. But for the most part it was a great strategy that made flying on Delta all the better during the pandemic.

Those in Delta Comfort+ or first class also have the option of complimentary beer or wine and snack boxes are also available in premium cabins on certain flights like those between Los Angeles and New York.

I was surprised that alcohol was on offer but there were no soft drinks to be found. Delta is improving the offering however and giving passengers more snack and drink options including hot meals in first class on certain transcontinental flights.

Delta is still the clear winner among the airlines I've flown in 2021.

The airline's middle seat blocking policy would be enough to earn the title but the airline has gone above and beyond including completely overhauling airports in its network to its new standards as I saw in New York Texas Utah and California. The measures that Delta is taking in the in-flight offering department are also a step in the right direction.

This project is produced in partnership with InvestigateWest and other media outlets and is supported in part by the Fund for Investigative Journalism.

Amid the 1970s Arab oil embargo a gasoline company’s TV ads showed an aging wooden windmill. As the wind died it slowed to stillness.

The ad asked: “But what do you do when the wind stops?”

For the next several decades fossil fuel providers continued to denigrate renewable energy. Big power utilities piled on with claims that fluctuating solar and wind power could black out the grid. Even the U.S. Energy Department deemed renewables “too rare too diffuse too distant too uncertain and too ill-timed” to meaningfully contribute as a top agency analyst put it in 2005.

Today we know that’s not true especially in Washington Oregon and British Columbia.

New research shows we are collectively poised to pioneer a climate-friendly energy future for the globe – that renewable electricity can not only move Cascadia off of fossil fuels but do so at an affordable price while creating some jobs along the way.

After decades of disinformation this may sound like a wishful vision. But building a cleaner and more equitable economy — and doing so in just a few decades to head off the worst effects of climate change — is backed by a growing body of regional and international research.

Getting off fossil fuels is “feasible necessary … and not very expensive” when compared to the earnings of the overall economy said Jeffrey Sachs an economist and global development expert at Columbia University.

To support our nonprofit environmental journalism please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How

Much of the confidence about the price tag comes down to this: Innovation and mass production have made wind and solar power installations cheaper than most fossil-fueled power plants and today’s fastest-growing source of energy worldwide. The key to moving Cascadia’s economies away from fossil fuels according to the latest research is building more to make renewable electricity our go-to “fuel.”

However doing that in time to help head off a cascading climatic crisis by mid-century means the region must take major steps in the next decade to speed the transition researchers say. And that will require social buy-in.

The new research highlights three mutually supporting strategies that squeeze out fossil fuels:

increasing energy efficiency to trim the amount of power we need

boosting renewable energy to make it possible to turn off climate-wrecking fossil-fuel plants and

plugging as much stuff as possible into the electrical grid.

Recent studies in Washington state and British Columbia and underway for Oregon point to efficiency and electrification as the most cost-effective route to slashing emissions while maintaining lifestyles and maximizing jobs. A recent National Academies of Science study reached the same conclusion calling electrification the core strategy for an equitable and economically advantageous energy transition.

However technologies don’t emerge in a vacuum. The social and economic adjustments required by the wholesale shift from fossil fuels that belch climate-warming carbon emissions to renewable power can still make or break decarbonization according to Jim Williams a University of San Francisco energy expert whose simulation software tools have guided many national and regional energy plans including two new U.S.-wide studies a December 2020 analysis for Washington state and another in process for Oregon.

Williams points to vital actions that are liable to rile up those who lose money in the deal. Steps like letting trees grow many decades older before they are cut down so they can suck up more carbon dioxide — which means forgoing quicker profits from selling timber. Or convincing rural communities and conservationists that they should accept power-transmission lines crossing farms and forests.

“It’s those kinds of policy questions and social acceptance questions that are the big challenges” said Williams.

Washington Oregon and British Columbia already mandate growing supplies of renewable power and help cover the added cost of some electric equipment. These include battery-powered cars SUVs and pickups on the road. Heat pumps — air conditioners that run in reverse to push heat into a building — can replace furnaces. And at industrial sites electric machines can take the place of older mechanical systems cutting costs and boosting reliability.

As these options drop in price they are weakening reliance on fossil fuels — even among professional chefs who’ve long sworn by cooking with gas.

“For each of the things that we enjoy and we need there’s a pathway to do that without producing any greenhouse gas emissions” said Jotham Peters managing partner for Vancouver-based energy analysis firm Navius Research whose clients include the B.C. government.

Key to decarbonization planning for Cascadia are computer simulations of future conditions known as models. These projections take electrification and other options and run with them. Researchers run dozens of simulated potential future energy scenarios for a given region tinkering with different variables: How much will energy demand grow? What happens if we can get 80 percent of people into electric cars? What if it’s only 50 percent? And so on.

Accelerating the transition requires large investments this modeling shows. Plugging in millions of vehicles and heat pumps demands both brawnier and more flexible power systems including more power lines and other infrastructure that communities often oppose. That demands both stronger policies and public acceptance. It means training and apprenticeships for the trades that must retrofit homes and ensuring that all communities benefit — especially those disproportionately suffering from energy-related pollution in the fossil fuel era.

Consensus is imperative but the new studies are bound to spark controversy. Because while affordable decarbonization is not free.

Projections for Washington and British Columbia suggest that decarbonizing Cascadia will spur extra job-stimulating growth. But the benefits and relatively low net cost mask a large swing in spending that will create winners and losers and without policies to protect disadvantaged communities from potential energy cost increases could leave some behind.

By 2030 the path to decarbonization shows Washingtonians buying about $5 billion less worth of natural gas coal and petroleum products while putting even more dollars toward cleaner vehicles and homes. No surprise then that oil and gas interests are attacking the new research.

And the research shows a likely economic speed bump around 2030. Economic growth would slow due to increased energy costs as economies race to make a sharp turn toward pollution reductions after nearly a decade of rising greenhouse gas emissions.

“Meeting that 2030 target is tough and I think it took everybody a little bit by surprise” said Nancy Hirsh executive director of the Seattle-based NW Energy Coalition and co-chair of a state panel that shaped Washington’s recent energy supply planning.

But that’s not cause to ease up. Wait longer says Hirsh and the price will only rise.

Charging Up

What most drives Cascadia’s energy models toward electrification is the dropping cost of renewable electricity.

Take solar energy. In 2010 no large power system in the world got more than 3 percent of its electricity from solar. But over the past decade solar energy’s cost fell more than 80 percent and by last year it was delivering over 9 percent of Germany’s electricity and over 19 percent of California’s.

Government mandates and incentives helped get the trend started. Once prohibitively expensive solar’s price now beats nuclear coal and gas-fired power and it’s expected to keep getting cheaper. The same goes for wind power whose jumbo jet-sized composite blades bear no resemblance to the rickety machines once mocked by Big Oil.

The solar array at Puget Sound Energy’s Wild Horse facility east of Ellensburg Washington was the region’s largest at the time of its installation over a decade ago. But its 502-kilowatt output is dwarfed by the generation from each of the site’s wind turbines. Today solar is cheaper than wind power per kilowatt and the largest solar plants generate several thousand times more power than the Wild House array. Dan DeLong/InvestigateWest

In contrast cleaning up gas- or coal-fired power plants by equipping them to capture their carbon pollution remains expensive even after decades of research and development and government incentives. Cost overruns and mechanical failures recently shuttered the world’s largest “low-carbon” coal-fired power plant in Texas after less than four years of operation.

Innovation and incentives are also making equipment that plugs into the grid cheaper. Electric options are good and getting better with a push from governments and a self-reinforcing cycle of performance improvement mass production and increased demand.

Battery advances and cost cuts over the past decade have made owning an electric car cheaper fuel included than conventional cars. Electric heat pumps may be the next electric wave. They’re three to four times more efficient than electric baseboard heaters save money over natural gas in most new homes and work in Cascadia’s coldest zones.

Merran Smith executive director of Vancouver-based nonprofit Clean Energy Canada says that — as with electric cars five years ago — people don’t realize how much heat pumps have improved. “Heat pumps used to be big huge noisy things” said Smith. “Now they’re a fraction of the size they’re quiet and efficient.”

Electrifying certain industrial processes can also cut greenhouse gases at low cost. Surprisingly even oil and gas drilling rigs and pipeline compressors can be converted to electric. Provincial utility BC Hydro is building new transmission lines to meet anticipated power demand from electrification of the fracking fields in northeastern British Columbia that supply much of Cascadia’s natural gas.

Retrofits enabled this coal power plant in southeast Texas to capture some of its carbon dioxide pollution which was then injected into aging oil wells to revive production. But problems with the capture technology and of unexpected shutdowns and energy-intensive technology made the plant’s coal-fired power — which is being priced out of the market by renewable energy — even less competitive. It was expected to run for 20 years but survived three years before low oil prices shut it down last year. NRG Energy

Simulating low-carbon living

The computer simulation tools guiding energy and climate strategies unlike previous models that looked at individual sectors take an economy-wide view. Planners can repeatedly run scenarios through sophisticated software tinkering with their assumptions each time to answer cross-cutting questions such as: Should the limited supply of waste wood from forestry that can be sustainably removed from forests be burned in power plants? Or is it more valuable converted to biofuel for airplanes that can’t plug into the grid?

Evolved Energy Research a San Francisco-based firm analyzed the situation in Washington. Its algorithms are tuned using data about energy production and use today — down to the number and types of furnaces stovetops or vehicles. It has expert assessments of future costs for equipment and fuels. And it knows the state’s mandated emissions targets.

Researchers run the model myriad times simulating decisions about equipment and fuel purchases — such as whether restaurants stick with gas or switch to electric induction ‘burners’ as their gas stoves wear out. The model finds the most cost-effective choices by homes and businesses that meet the state’s climate goals.

Rather than accepting that optimal scenario and calling it a day modelers account for uncertainty in their estimates of future costs by throwing in various additional constraints and rerunning the model.

That probing shows that longer reliance on climate-warming natural gas and petroleum fuels increases costs. In fact all of the climate-protecting scenarios achieve Washington’s goals at relatively low cost compared to the state’s historic spending on energy.

The end result of these scenarios are net-zero carbon emissions in 2050 in which a small amount of emissions remaining are offset by rebounding forests or equipment that scrubs CO2 from the air.

But the seeds of that transformation must be sown by 2030. The scenarios identify common strategies that the state can pursue with low risk of future regrets.

One no-brainer is to rapidly add wind and solar power to wring out CO2 emissions from Washington’s power sector. The projections end coal-fired power by 2025 as required by law but also show that with grid upgrades gas-fired power plants that produce greenhouse gas emissions can stay turned off most of the time. That delivers about 16.2 million of the 44.8 million metric tons of CO2 emissions cut required by 2030 under state law.

All of the Washington scenarios also jack up electricity consumption to power cars and heating. By 2050 Washington homes and businesses would draw more than twice as much power from the grid as they did last year meaning climate-friendly electricity is displacing climate-unfriendly gasoline diesel fuel and natural gas. In the optimal case electricity meets 98 percent of transport energy in 2050 and over 80 percent of building energy use.

By 2050 the high-electrification scenarios would create over 60000 extra jobs across the state as replacing old and inefficient equipment and construction of renewable power plants stimulates economic growth according to projections from Washington D.C.-based FTI Consulting. Scenarios with less electrification require more low-carbon fuels that cut emissions at higher cost and thus create 15000 to 35000 fewer jobs.

Much of the new employment comes in middle-class positions — including about half of the total in construction — leading to big boosts in employment income. Washingtonians earn over $7 billion more in 2050 under the high-electrification scenarios compared to a little over $5 billion if buildings stick with gas heating through 2050 and less than $2 billion with extra transportation fuels.

Rocketing to 2030

Evolved Energy’s electrification-heavy decarbonization pathways for Washington dovetail with a growing body of international research such as that National Academy of Sciences report and a major U.S. decarbonization study led by Princeton University. (See Grist’s 100% Clean Energy video below for a popularized view of similar pathways to slash U.S. carbon emissions informed by Princeton modeler Jesse Jenkins.)

Washington’s projected future also broadly matches other research in Cascadia. Extensive modeling for BC by Navius Research shows electrification carrying the load.

Brianne Riehl an environmental policy researcher and Navius’ communications manager notes that the firm’s recent Canada-wide study with 62 different scenarios identified electrification as British Columbia’s primary carbon-cutter. As Navius described the road forward for BC’s provincially owned utility BC Hydro last year: “The results do not show a future where other potential low-(greenhouse gas) energy pathways out-compete electricity.”

Electrification even sweeps sectors that use British Columbia’s cheap home-drilled natural gas. Peters said that Navius’ model taps electrification for the “vast majority” of predicted emissions reductions from buildings for example.

And its modeling foresees large-scale electrification of BC’s gas fields and the gas liquefaction plants under construction on the coast to ship liquified natural gas to Asia which currently are fueled by gas itself.

The challenge is accelerating these transitions. Action by 2030 is needed across Cascadia to deliver on societal demand to fight climate change and to lay the tracks for the difficult long-term task of squeezing out nearly all carbon emissions a few decades later.

In 2030 Evolved Energy’s optimal case for Washington foresees sales of electric cars SUVs and pickups roaring from 7.3 percent of light-duty vehicle sales in 2020 to 85.2 percent in 2030. In that year’s simulation Washingtonians buy more than 1 million electric vehicles and purchase 21 percent less gasoline and diesel fuel.

That along with growing electrification of buses buildings and more requires infrastructure such as charging stations some quick growth in electricity generation and power lines to carry it. In Oregon and Washington such investments may catch a tailwind if Congress backs President Biden’s $2-trillion infrastructure package. But building transmission lines requires tough negotiations with affected communities which can be time-consuming.

Revving up in BC likely means adding wind and solar plants faster than the province expected. Unpublished province-level findings from Navius’ most recent Canada-wide modeling found that electricity demand in British Columbia could increase by up to 30 percent by 2030.

BC Hydro has high hopes for its Site C hydropower project which is under construction but struggling to overcome cost overruns geotechnical challenges and opposition from First Nations. But it may provide only one-third of the new power required.

Washington’s modeling points to an additional need for 2030: a big jump in supply for cleaner fuels. These would replace fossil fuels that drive heavy vehicles such as ships and airplanes and power industrial processes such as cement and steel foundries. These uses require a more intense energy source than electricity. (More on those fuels in next week’s installment of Getting to Zero.)

Overall both studies suggest Cascadia can afford to transition to a low-carbon economy. Navius figures decarbonization will slow annual economic growth in British Columbia in 2030 by about a tenth trimming it from a projected 2 percent to 1.8 percent in 2030. Economic analysis for Washington state by FTI Consulting also projected slower growth in the late 2020s and early 2030s when extra energy costs are at their highest. It projects 10000 to 15000 fewer jobs to be created in Washington relative to the climate-be-damned growth scenario. The state’s current employment is about 3.3. million.

Embracing the messengers?

Burning less gasoline diesel and natural gas produces cleaner air — something that’s not factored into most economic forecasting including FTI’s costing for Washington. The cost of decarbonization in 2030 looks even more affordable when one considers avoided air and water pollution from burning fossil fuels which studies show will reduce illness lost work and school days and premature deaths.

Avoiding climate damage meanwhile would pay even larger dividends in the long run. Scientists expect action by Cascadia to help slow impacts of climate change reducing future costs for damages to property and infrastructure from megafires larger storms and sea level rise.

For Smith at Clean Energy Canada electrifying is also a potent business opportunity for Cascadia. She urges British Columbia’s government and industries to forsake a dying dream of growing LNG exports and to instead stake the future on decarbonizing the province’s exports.

Smith points to BC’s aluminum which thanks to BC’s near-total reliance on hydropower is gaining advantage as one of the world’s least carbon-intensive suppliers.

Companies like Tesla and BMW are looking for low-carbon aluminum notes Smith: “I don’t think that most British Columbians realize that we have a nearly 100 percent emissions-free electricity grid nor what a competitive advantage it is.”

With more renewable power the province can decarbonize all of its natural resource exports including forest products and other metals such as copper cobalt and nickel. “Branding BC that way rather than as a fossil fuel exporter will attract more investment” she said.

Washington and Oregon could build on toeholds in clean-energy manufacturing such as the Daimler plant that makes electric trucks in Portland and the eCascadia electric semi prototypes that Freightliner is assembling in Redmond Oregon.

Early this month Daimler Trucks North American began signing up buyers for its eCascadia battery-powered semi truck one of two electric models that Damiler expects to begin manufacturing late next year at the Freightliner plant in Redmond Washington. The eCascadia will have a 250-mile range. Conventional semis can travel over 2000 miles on a full tank of diesel. Daimler Trucks

But not everyone embraces an electrified future. Fossil fuel interests in Washington have called the modeling biased and are raising the specter of electrification-driven blackouts.

When asked to comment on the modeling for Washington Jessica Spiegel northwest region director for the Western States Petroleum Association issued a statement saying that “an all-electric economy is not a viable alternative.”

Natural gas interests are also pushing back. The Northwest Gas Association and other interests joined WSPA in a joint December 2020 letter attacking the modeling as “insufficient” and calling the state’s endorsement of electrification a result of bias: “Using this endpoint as justification the strategy then makes determinations about the best path to get there” they wrote.

Resistance to action toward accelerated electrification has been on full display in recent months as Washington’s Legislature considers an array of policies to encourage or mandate a transition to cleaner energy. One proposal backed by Washington Governor Jay Inslee to restrict delivery of gas to new buildings by 2030 died early under assault from the gas industry and some unions.

During a hearing on the Better Homes & Clean Buildings Bill a lobbyist for Puget Sound Energy a suburban Seattle-based investor-owned utility that sells power and is also Washington’s largest natural gas supplier raised the threat of energy shortfalls citing a 2019 study suggesting that power demand could soon outstrip supply as the region’s coal-fired power plants shut down.

Environmental advocates point out that oil and gas producers and distributors have a vested interest in opposing rapid reductions in petroleum and natural gas consumption. They also note that BP an oil and gas major that operates Washington’s largest refinery dropped its membership in WSPA over the group’s lobbying to block climate action.

Grid experts say the best way to ensure reliability is to get cracking on power system upgrades needed to support a larger supply of wind and solar power. Patrick Oshie an energy policy expert and Washington’s representative on a regional power grid planning group said Evolved Energy’s modeling demonstrated that the state “can progress to a zero carbon future” and indicated a “need for early action.”

Spencer Gray the Portland-based executive director for the Northwest & Intermountain Power Producers Coalition which represents many renewable energy developers says ensuring Cascadia’s power supply is “solvable” without slowing decarbonization. What’s crucial he says is to strengthen the grid.

Gray and Oshie are two of the many experts working toward creation of a regional power market for the Western grid which interconnects all of the electrical systems in the U.S. and Canada west of the Rockies. They are also working to accelerate expansion of power lines so that Cascadia and its neighbors can access more low-cost renewable energy such as the excellent wind resources in Montana.

“Five to 10 years from now is when we need it” said Gray. “We need to start getting the stuff financed and sited now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvb3Bpbmlvbi9jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1tZWF0bGVzcy1tZWF0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Let's Launch a Moonshot for Meatless Meat (Published 2021),"I’m a vegan but I’m also a realist. There’s no chance humanity is going to give up meat en masse anytime soon. That said we can’t just wish away the risks of industrial animal agriculture. If we don’t end this system soon terrible things will happen to us and to the planet. Terrible things are already happening.

So this is going to be a column about finding a way to work with humanity’s growing appetite for meat rather than against it. All we need to do is replace the animals or at least a lot of them. Technologically we’re closer to that than you might think. What we need is for government to put money and muscle behind the project — just as it’s doing for electric cars and weatherized homes and renewable energy — so that the future happens fast enough to save the present. This is the hole in the American Jobs Plan and it wouldn’t take much money just a bit of vision to fill.

Let me first lay out the urgency of the task and the rewards we could reap. As best we can tell the novel coronavirus jumped from bats to some other animal to humans with the locus of infection being a Chinese meat market. There’s nothing unusual about that. Swine flus — yes plural — jump from pigs to humans. Avian flus jump from birds to humans. Ebola most likely came from monkeys. “Preventing the Next Pandemic” a report by the United Nations Environment Program estimates that 75 percent of the new infectious diseases that threaten humans come from animals.

The U.N. report goes on to name the seven major drivers of these emerging animal-to-human diseases. First is the increasing demand for animal protein. As populations get richer they eat more meat. Since 1961 global meat production has more than quadrupled to more than 340 million tons from 71 million tons. Americans are among the top meat consumers in the world: In 2018 each of us ate on average 222 pounds of red meat and chicken. Consumption in most other countries is far lower but rising. In China for instance per capita meat consumption has more than doubled since 1990.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy90ZXNsYS1vcGVucy10ZWwtYXZpdi1wb3AtdXAtc2hvcC02NjYwMjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla opens Tel Aviv pop-up shop - Israel News,"Tesla has opened a pop-up store in Tel Aviv to increase interest in its electric vehicle which it began selling in Israel in February.The company said that the shop in the Ramat Aviv Mall was “an opportunity for future owners to see the Model 3 up close and meet with Tesla staff.” The pop-up exhibit will run for the next three months.Since launching phone and online sales of its flagship Model 3 car in Israel two months ago Tesla has completed shipment to customers of the first wave of about 120 orders.

Tesla is planning to open additional Supercharger stations across Israel: in Haifa next month and in Eilat.

Under new business motion was made by Councilperson Lemont Glasgow and seconded by Councilperson David DuBose on an ordinance to amend the zoning map for a property located at 2639 Preston Street in Newberry.

The proposed assignment of zoning classification and future land use and zoning map amendment is the result of the owner’s petition to reclassify parcels from GC – General Commercial to R8 – Residential. The Newberry Planning Commission recommended a zoning classification of R8 – Residential. Per Article 10.02 the land owner will have to install buffer yards of six trees per linear 100 feet or 18 shrubs per linear 100 feet to get the parcel to code after rezoning. A public hearing will be held May 11 prior to second reading.

Motion was made by Councilperson Jackie Holmes and seconded by Councilperson Edwin Wicker to approve first reading of an ordinance to repeal and replace Article 1 of Chapter 10 pertaining to occupational licenses taxes and regulations. Complying with the South Carolina Business License Tax Standardization Act the ordinance would repeal the existing license ordinance and replace it with the revised standardized model business license ordinance. This would be effective for the business license year beginning May 1 2022.

Eric Budds with the Municipal Association of South Carolina (MASC) spoke with council about Act 176 the business license standardization act and said one of the required steps of compliance was for municipalities to reclassify their businesses to a 2021 Class Schedule that used the IRS profitability statistics in order to classify businesses into one of seven rate classes as well as some optional rate classes that council may choose to use.

“The association has assisted the City of Newberry in doing that rebalancing and reclassifying your businesses based on that class schedule” Budds said. “I’m pleased to tell you that the results were very positive your ordinance has been kept up to date and the impact on the businesses is relatively minor.”

Budds said there would be some businesses that would move up or down within rate classifications that would result in them paying slightly more or less than they paid the prior year however the movement was mandated by Act 176.

Councilpersons David Force and Carlton Kinard inquired as to the importance of notifying business owners of the change no matter how they may be impacted DeWitt said city staff could send out a letter along with business license renewals that would hopefully explain the mandate to business owners.

Motion was made by Wicker and seconded by Holmes to extend the city’s mask ordinance 30 days more to expire (unless extended) on May 13.

Senn said the town’s number of cases were down and among those aged 15 and up 37.5% had been vaccinated. Inquiring with businesses the city’s mask ordinance impacted the reaction was mixed Senn said with some saying they had difficulties with the ordinance and others asking to keep it in place as their employees worked to get vaccinated.

Force voted not to extend the ordinance.

Other Business:

• A proclamation was read and approved designating the month of May as Building Safety Month.

• A proclamation was read and approved designating May 2-8 2021 as Drinking Water Week.

• A proclamation was read and approved designating April 10-16 2021 as Week of the Young Child.

• Motion was made by Wicker and seconded by Force of an authorization to allow alcohol in designated areas for Business After Hours. The Newberry County Chamber of Commerce requested permission to allow alcoholic beer and wine served by designated event venue staff using plastic cups for the wine and beer in original cans as part of their event on May 7 from 5:30-7 p.m. The event will be held in front of the Chamber/Visitors Center offices bound by the front of Community Hall Main Street Caldwell Street and Boyce Street. This would allow for event patrons to travel the event space by foot with an alcoholic beverage.

• Following a return to open session DuBose made a motion to appoint Keith Avery to the Newberry Opera House Board seconded by Holmes.

The directive was a penalty for the two networks not adhering to the central bank’s norms on storing data within India.What this means is that American Express and other banks that issue cards under the Amex network can no longer issue these to new customers. Further new Diners Club cards  which is issued by HDFC Bank can also not be given.The order added that this will not impact existing customers which means that cards can be renewed and lost ones replaced.In April 2018 the RBI had asked all payment system providers to ensure that within six months all data relating to payment systems operated by them is stored onshore in India. Although the initial deadline was September 2018 the process of ensuring compliance turned out to be a long-drawn one as card companies initially lobbied for relaxation of regulations.The card companies said that by preventing data from being sent outside banks would be denied fraud prevention analytics which is obtained by gathering experiences across the world. The RBI subsequently clarified that while data could be sent abroad for processing the same should be brought back to India within 24 hours and deleted from offshore computers.In India the card industry consists of issuing bank and the payment networks which are dominated by RuPay Visa and Mastercard. While Visa and Mastercard have stated that they are compliant with the norms RBI’s circular makes it clear that Amex and Diners Club did not comply.“These entities have been found non-compliant with the directions on Storage of Payment System Data ” the RBI said. It clarified that both these entities are being penalised in their role as payment system operators authorised to operate card networks in the country under the Payments and Systems Settlements Act 2007. Amex besides being a network operator also has a bank licence in India. However it uses the bank licence only to issue credit cards.These networks will have to now report compliance to the RBI and submit a board-approved system audit report (SAR) conducted by a CERT-In empanelled auditor within the timelines specified therein.An Amex spokesperson said “We have been in regular dialogue with the Reserve Bank of India about data localisation requirements and have demonstrated our progress towards complying with the regulation. While we’re disappointed that the RBI has taken this course of action we are working with them to resolve their concerns as quickly as possible. This does not impact the services that we offer to our existing customers in India and our customers can continue to use and accept our cards as normal.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9jYXJpYmJlYW4tbGllLWZsYXQtYXdhcmQtc3BhY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fly lie-flat to Mexico and the Caribbean with American and Delta award space,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Bernie Madoff: How he pulled it off

Bernie Madoff: How he pulled it off

For the 12-and-a-half years between his arrest and his death this past April 14 Bernie Madoff barely said a word to reporters … or so we thought. It turns out he was engaged in extensive correspondence with a journalist named Jim Campbell – 400 pages' worth.

There were handwritten letters Campbell told correspondent Jim Axelrod. ""The vast bulk of 400 pages is emails. I have a chunk they're single spaced they're long. They're full of compulsion to explain. Very Nixonian in the need to rationalize and justify his behavior.""

A few of the hundreds of pages of correspondence disgraced investor Bernie Madoff sent to Jim Campbell author of the book ""Madoff Talks."" CBS News

Campbell is out with a book ""Madoff Talks"" which takes us inside the mind of the man who perpetrated the biggest fraud in American financial history.

Axelrod asked ""Did he ever express remorse?""

""Yes and it would happen this way: 'My lawyers tell me I have to express remorse Jim'"" Campbell said. ""I said 'Here's a victim that you decimated how do you feel about that?' And he said 'I really … a tremendous amount of remorse. Please tell her that I say that.'""

""Why didn't he reach out to her himself and say 'I'm sorry'?""

""He couldn't do that really.""

His grotesque ego permitted only one sentence of apology to his son Andrew but allowed him to write letter after letter to a stranger to try to manage his legacy.

Campbell said ""You realize that he's writing a guy that he's never met six- seven-page single-spaced letters and he sent a letter to Andy and his fiancée-partner one sentence: 'I'm so sorry Dad.' Not even 'love' – 'I'm so sorry Dad.'""

Jim Campbell

""That's chilling"" Axelrod said.

""It illuminates a narcissist that is compelled to rationalize what happened. Sometimes he would go 'Jim you know nobody knows why Madoff did this.' I'd say 'Bernie you're Madoff!'""

Prison officials refused Campbell's request for a face-to-face visit with Madoff but he took Madoff's wife Ruth to lunch many times starting in 2011.

McGraw-Hill Education

Axelrod asked ""Was Ruth Madoff complicit?""

""My assessment is she was not complicit and she did not know about it"" said Campbell. ""I asked her 'What did you say after Bernie told you guys?' 'What is a Ponzi scheme?'""

""And you think that's on the level? You think Ruth Madoff really didn't know what a Ponzi scheme was?""

""I don't believe that she really understood what was going on.""

""It removes an element of sinister that Bernie has attached to him and just makes Ruth tragic.""

""It does"" said Campbell ""and also it's again emanating from Madoff's ego. He could never have admitted to his wife and family that he was running this thing as a criminal enterprise.""

Bernie Madoff outlived both his sons: Mark died by suicide on the second anniversary of Madoff's arrest; Andrew died of cancer in 2014. Campbell said ""Andrew would say to me 'He killed Mark quickly he's killing me slowly.'""

Andrew and his brother had worked for their father in a legitimate billion-dollar market-making business Madoff kept separate from the Ponzi scheme. After Madoff confessed to his sons they turned him in. Andrew never spoke a word to him again.

Axelrod asked ""Did he have any capacity for introspection?""

""No. Not much. I don't think he had introspection because he's keeping this thing running in his brain every day complete criminal enterprise at the same time he's keeping the legitimate business going. How could a guy do that if he looked inside himself for two minutes?""

""It's the work of a psychopath.""

""It's the work of a financial psychopath yes"" Campbell said.

Campbell showed Axelrod one of the principle tools of the fraud: a statement of Madoff's firm that went to his investors each month.

Jim Campbell

""Morgan Stanley PepsiCo American Express Pfizer Bank of America Procter & Gamble – this particular client thought Madoff was investing his or her money in these companies?"" Axelrod asked.

""Yes.""

Was he? ""No it's completely fake"" said Campbell. ""He had complete phony records run off of an old archaic IBM AS400. And every trade there [was] faked. But that was just for the regulators and for show.""

Campbell says plenty of blame extends well beyond Madoff. When Axelrod asked how regulators could not uncover the fraud he replied ""It's inexcusable it's gross negligence incompetence.""

But at the heart of his story is a criminal mastermind who kept spinning to the end. Said Campbell ""He thought that I would set the record straight and you'll see the first letter says 'You can help clear up all the misperceptions that are out there.'""

If that was his calculus then Bernie Madoff's final investment in Jim Campbell ended up like all the others: worthless.

He said ""I say it's not too far of a stretch to say that he was a monster. He was 'a product' as he told me 'of the corrupt nature of Wall Street.'""

""So it was somebody else's fault?"" asked Axelrod.

""Yes the blame was always shifted to somebody else.""

The event was captured on film with multiple passengers taking out their phones to record.

However despite one video shared to social media lasting a full minute and a half there didn’t appear to be many people trying to break up the melee. Nor were the many law enforcement agencies resident inside the airport quick to respond although near the end of the video an American Airlines employee does appear to try to encourage peace.

Reportedly though after this series of incidents arrests were made. Perhaps the most fitting thing about all of this be that it all took place right in front of the Urban Decay store.

New Delhi made an emergency order to Twitter and Facebook to censor over 100 posts in the country. Twitter disclosed the government order on Lumen database a Harvard University project. The microblogging network and Facebook complied with the request and withheld those posts from users in India.

TechCrunch reported on Saturday that Twitter was not the only platform affected by the new order. Facebook which identifies India as its largest market by users didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.

The Indian government confirmed on Sunday that it ordered Facebook and Instagram and Twitter to take down posts that it deemed posed potential to incite panic among the public hinder its efforts to contain the pandemic or were simply misleading.

(Credit where it's due: Twitter is one of the handful of companies that timely discloses takedown actions and also shares who made those requests.)

The world's second largest nation -- which has also previously ordered Twitter to block some tweets and accounts critical of its policies and threatened jail time to employees in the event of non-compliance -- comes as the country reports a record of over 330000 new Covid cases a day the worst by any country. Multiple news reports doctors and academicians say that even these Covid figures as alarmingly high as they are are underreported.

Amid an unprecedented collapse of the nation's health infrastructure Twitter has become a rare beam of hope in what it describes as one of its ""priority markets"" as people crowdsource data to help one another find medicines and availability of beds and oxygen supplies.

Policy-focused Indian news outlet Medianama which first reported on New Delhi's new order Friday said among those whose tweets have been censored in India include high profile public figures such as Revanth Reddy (a Member of Parliament) Moloy Ghatak (a minister in West Bengal) Vineet Kumar Singh (actor) filmmakers Vinod Kapri and Avinash Das.

In a statement a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch ""When we receive a valid legal request we review it under both the Twitter Rules and local law. If the content violates Twitter’s Rules the content will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction but not in violation of the Twitter Rules we may withhold access to the content in India only. In all cases we notify the account holder directly so they’re aware that we’ve received a legal order pertaining to the account.""

""We notify the user(s) by sending a message to the email address associated with the account(s) if available. Read more about our Legal request FAQs. The legal requests that we receive are detailed in the bianual Twitter Transparency Report and requests to withhold content are published on Lumen.""

India has become one of the key markets for several global technology giants as they look to accelerate their userbase growth and make long-term bets. But India once the example of an ideal open market has also proposed or enforced several rules in the country in recent years under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership that in some ways arguably makes it difficult for American firms to keep expanding in the South Asian market without compromising on some of the values that users in their home market take for granted.

An East Coast businessman lures in more than two dozen investors with promises of lucrative profits — when in reality those profits don’t exist and he’s using money from new investors to pay back previous ones.

But in this particular case his name isn’t Bernie Madoff. It’s Ian Bick.

By 2013 Bick was an 18-year-old event promoter with multiple businesses in Danbury Connecticut. On the outside they seemed to be the successful ventures of an entrepreneurial prodigy. But behind the scenes “it was a free-for-all s**tshow” Bick says in “Generation Hustle” HBO Max’s new anthology series about the young ambitious and fraudulent.

While Bick says he wasn’t trying to run a Ponzi scheme – “I looked at it as taking one loan to pay off another loan” Bick explains in the series – the feds disagreed. In 2016 Bick was convicted of defrauding his business investors of nearly $500000.

Whether on the smaller scale like Bick’s or superlatively large like Bernie Madoff’s this kind of financial fraud is unnervingly and increasingly common. Here’s a look at eight of the most notorious Ponzi schemes in US history:

1. Charles Ponzi – $15 million

Compared to today’s notorious cons the loss associated with this scam in 1920 might seem a pittance. But in the tale of Charles Ponzi it wasn’t just the size of the swindle but the speed with which it was done. According to Smithsonian Magazine Ponzi made an estimated $15 million in eight months by convincing lenders he could make them rich with investments in international postal reply coupons. His story was so infamous that the basics of the pyramid scheme – take money from a new investor to pay back an old one – began to carry his name despite the fact that he wasn’t the first to do it.

2. Lou Pearlman – $300 million

The man behind platinum-selling boy bands ‘NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys Lou Pearlman’s legacy also includes a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition to being sued by the very boy bands he created for stealing money Pearlman swindled investors and banks out of more than $300 million on the basis of companies that only existed on paper.

In 2008 he was convicted of conspiracy and money laundering charges and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. He died at the age of 62 in 2016.

3. Gerald Payne and Greater Ministries International – $448 million

In the 1990s Gerald Payne and leadership at his Greater Ministries International Church convinced nearly 20000 investors to hand over millions in a program that claimed it could “Double Your Blessings.” The IRS began to investigate based on suspicious bank activity and by 2001 Payne was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison. At the time the IRS called it one of the biggest Ponzi schemes it had ever investigated.

4. Reed Slatkin – $593 million

Known as a co-founder of EarthLink the internet service provider that launched in the mid-90s prosecutors say Reed Slatkin’s massive Ponzi scheme began long before the company existed. In 2003 the former Santa Barbara investment manager pleaded guilty to defrauding his investors of more than $500 million across 15 years starting in 1986.

5. Scott Rothstein – $1.2 billion

It isn’t always finance types who run the biggest scams: Scott Rothstein used his Fort Lauderdale law firm to run an eye-popping $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. According to the Miami Herald Rothstein convinced his investors to buy into bogus legal settlements. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 – a term that’s held despite his attempts at reduction.

6. Tom Petters – $3.7 billion

Businessman Tom Petters was accused of stealing money from hedge funds missionaries and pastors alike according to the New York Times. Petters promised investors that by pouring money into his organization they’d fund the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit. But that’s not what happened and in 2010 Petters was sentenced to 50 years in prison. The scam is reportedly the biggest in Minnesota history.

7. R. Allen Stanford – $7 billion

Texas tycoon R. Allen Stanford masterminded a 20-year scheme via his offshore bank in Antigua cheating almost 30000 investors from more than 100 countries out of billions. The scam involved fake certificates of deposit and prosecutors accused Stanford of funneling funds into his personal interests including real estate and cricket tournaments. In 2012 Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in federal lockup.

8. Bernie Madoff – $20 billion

It’s unclear at what point Bernie Madoff began shaping the largest Ponzi scheme in history; some believe it may have extended all the way back to the 1960s. Regardless of the timeframe what is known is that he conned thousands of investors out of $20 billion in principal funds. After his arrest in 2008 he was sentenced to 150 years in prison where he died on April 14 at the age of 82.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L2pvZS1iaWRlbi1hc3NlcnRzLWFtZXJpY2FzLXJvbGUtaW4tdGhlLWZpZ2h0LWFnYWluc3QtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Biden asserts America's role in the fight against climate change,"Editor’s note: This article has been updated to take in news of Joe Biden’s climate summit which occurred after The Economist went to press

MEETINGS OF GLOBAL leaders always combine in varying proportions pomp substance glitches and questionable set design. The first day of President Joe Biden’s virtual climate summit on April 22nd was no different. There were lofty declarations and flurries of press releases. Presidents spoke from desks festooned by flags. Mr Biden—along with John Kerry and Antony Blinken America’s climate envoy and secretary of state respectively—sat at a desk curved around an oddly scraggly patch of grass. And there was a long silence when America’s president and most senior statesmen waited awkwardly while staring at a jumbo screen that showed Vladimir Putin Russia’s president looking bored and vaguely annoyed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9wYXVsLXJ1c2VzYWJhZ2luYS1jYWxsZWQtaGVyby1ob3RlbC1yd2FuZGEtbm93LWFjY3VzZWQvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9NzY5NTM1NjnSAXFodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3BhdWwtcnVzZXNhYmFnaW5hLWNhbGxlZC1oZXJvLWhvdGVsLXJ3YW5kYS1ub3ctYWNjdXNlZC9zdG9yeT9pZD03Njk1MzU2OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Rusesabagina was called a hero after 'Hotel Rwanda' now he's accused of terrorism,"""Are you going to allow my father to die in jail?""

LONDON -- Paul Rusesabagina thought he was heading to Burundi when he boarded an airplane in the United Arab Emirates on the night of Aug. 27 2020. But the 66-year-old former hotelier who inspired the acclaimed 2004 film ""Hotel Rwanda"" landed behind bars in Rwanda's capital.

Rusesabagina's whereabouts were unknown for several days until Rwandan authorities paraded him in handcuffs during a press conference in Kigali on Aug. 31. Rusesabagina's adopted daughters Anaise and Carine Kanimba were together in Washington D.C. when they got a telephone call from their brother telling them about their father's arrest.

""It was 6 a.m. in the morning and he said 'Dad is in Kigali'"" Anaise Kanimba 29 recalled during an interview with ABC News in Washington. ""We didn't believe what he said at first but then we know he would never joke on something like that. And it was this nightmare that we never thought would ever be true.""

Rusesabagina who is originally from Rwanda but is a Belgian citizen and permanent U.S. resident has been detained in his home country ever since and is facing a slew of terrorism-related charges that include murder and financing terrorism. If convicted he could face 25 years to life in prison. He has maintained his innocence.

The case has drawn worldwide attention and alarm including from Rusesabagina’s family who fear that he is facing a show trial and will die in jail.

""The understanding has always been that these allegations against Paul are linked to his criticism of the regime that's in power in Rwanda"" Rusesabagina's lead counsel Kate Gibson told ABC News during a remote interview from Geneva.

The 'Hotel Rwanda' story

Rusesabagina was the manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali during the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when divisions between the country's two main ethnic groups came to a head. The Rwandan government controlled by extremist members of the Hutu ethnic majority launched a systemic campaign with its allied Hutu militias to wipe out the Tutsi ethnic minority slaughtering more than 800000 people over the course of 100 days mostly Tutsis and the moderate Hutus who tried to protect them according to the United Nations.

Anaise and Carine Kanimba were toddlers when their biological Tutsi parents were among those killed in the bloodshed.

""They were telling people to like come out of their houses come out to the streets and that they were going to take everyone to a safe place and my parents believed it"" Carine Kanimba 27 recalled during a telephone interview with ABC News from Brussels. ""As soon as they got everyone kind of lined up in the streets they started shooting.""

More than 1200 people took shelter in the Hotel des Mille Collines during what is often described as the darkest chapter of Rwanda's history. Rusesabagina who is of both Hutu and Tutsi descent said he used his job and his connections with the Hutu elite to protect the hotel's guests from massacre. The events were later immortalized in ""Hotel Rwanda"" with American actor Don Cheadle's portrayal of Rusesabagina garnering an Academy Award nomination for best actor in 2005.

The genocide ended in July 1994 when a rebel group led by a Tutsi major-general named Paul Kagame defeated Rwandan government forces. Kagame now 63 became Rwanda's de facto leader before officially assuming the role of president in 2000.

Rusesabagina and his wife adopted their newly orphaned nieces Anaise and Carine Kanimba before fleeing Rwanda with the girls and their four other children in 1996 to live in exile in Belgium.

From real-life hero to hunted dissident

After the movie's release Rusesabagina rose to fame and was lauded as a hero. He published an autobiography ""An Ordinary Man"" and began giving paid speeches at schools universities churches and businesses. He started the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation ""to help provide voice to victims of genocide and support peace efforts in Rwanda and throughout the world"" according to the nonprofit's website. And he picked up numerous awards along the way including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 the highest civilian honor given by the American president.

Since fleeing his homeland Rusesabagina also became an outspoken critic of the Rwandan government. In his book Rusesabagina condemned Kagame's Rwanda as ""a nation governed by and for the benefit of a small group of elite Tutsis."" He also publicly denounced Kagame as a dictator in various interviews statements and speeches.

The Rwandan government hit back. Just months after the film's debut Kagame called Rusesabagina a ""manufactured hero.""

In 2007 Rwanda’s ambassador to the United Nations accused Rusesabagina of financing armed rebel groups along the country’s border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A Rwandan prosecutor repeated the claim in 2010 saying he had evidence that Rusesabagina wired large sums of money to rebel commanders.

Rusesabagina relocated his family to San Antonio Texas in 2009 after assassination attempts and several break-ins at their home just outside Brussels.

""Kagame has been after my father since the movie 'Hotel Rwanda' came out. When my father received the Presidential Medal of Freedom Kagame also increased his attacks on him"" Anaise Kanimba told ABC News. ""My father had to wear a bulletproof jacket every time he had to give a speech.""

In May 2020 Rwanda's National Commission for the Fight against Genocide an ostensibly independent body published a report about ""what really took place at the Hotel des Mille Collines"" featuring dozens of testimonies from genocide survivors who accused Rusesabagina of exaggerating his role in saving the refugees or even profiting from it.

ABC News spoke with some of the survivors who have come out against Rusesabagina. One of them Wellars ""Zozo"" Bizumuremyi said he worked with Rusesabagina as the hotel's concierge.

""Paul says he protected people -- it's a lie"" Bizumuremyi told ABC News during an interview in Kigali. ""If you didn't have money he wouldn't let you stay at the hotel.""

But American screenwriter Keir Pearson who co-wrote “Hotel Rwanda” and garnered an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay said the dispute over Rusesabagina’s claim to fame is ""just a smoke screen.""

""Kagame praised the film when it screened in Rwanda in 2005"" Pearson told ABC News in an email. ""It was only after Paul became critical of Kagame for not implementing long promised democratic reforms that the smear campaign against Paul and the veracity of the film began.""

Pearson said he spent about four years researching the Rwandan genocide and what took place at the Hotel des Mille Collines prior to making the movie interviewing survivors for ""countless hours.""

""We got Paul's story right"" he said.

A 'flawless' trap

Rusesabagina didn't tell his family that he was planning to fly to Burundi from Dubai last August. But one of his daughters who helped book his flights to and from Dubai said that wasn't unusual.

""I didn't know much about his plans in Dubai and generally given how much he travels we usually don't even get into those details"" Carine Kanimba told ABC News. ""We're also very careful over what we say over the phone because we know that the [Rwandan] government has been chasing him for so many years. There had been assassination attempts they had broken into our home we knew that they had bugged his phone and were tracking him.""

When Rusesabagina arrived in the emirate on the evening of Aug. 27 2020 he contacted his family to let them know that he had landed safely. He then met up with Constantin Niyomwungere a Burundi-born pastor who Rusesabagina alleged had invited him to speak at churches in Burundi about his experience during the Rwandan genocide. Later that night the pair hopped on a private jet that Rusesabagina believed would take them to Burundi's capital Bujumbura according to Rusesabagina's international legal team.

Rusesabagina didn't know that the pastor was working as an informant for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau and had tricked him into boarding a chartered flight to Kigali.

""Myself the pilot and cabin crew knew we were coming to Kigali"" Niyomwungere told Rwanda's high court in Kigali on March 5. ""The only person who didn’t know where we were headed was Paul.""

Rwandan prosecutors alleged that Rusesabagina wanted to go to Burundi to coordinate with rebel groups based there and in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Rusesabagina told the court that after arriving in Kigali early on Aug. 28 2020 he was brought to an unknown location where he remained blindfolded and bound at the hands and feet for three days and was unable to communicate with his family or lawyers. Rusesabagina's attorneys have accused Rwandan authorities of kidnapping him and bringing him to the country illegally.

""Instead of being able to go through these legal routes that the Rwandan government has taken in the past when they wanted to bring someone back into their jurisdiction for a criminal trial they went out of their way to avoid and circumvent that procedure by kidnaping him"" Gibson told ABC News. ""To me that speaks volumes about the credibility and reliability of the evidence that they have against Paul. If they had a real case against him they would have had him extradited.""

The Rwandan government has admitted to paying for the plane that took Rusesabagina to Kigali but Kagame said there was no wrongdoing because he was ""brought here on the basis of what he believed and wanted to do.""

""So there was no kidnap. It was actually flawless"" Kagame told Rwanda’s public broadcaster during an interview on Sept. 6 2020.

The United Arab Emirates has denied having any involvement in Rusesabagina’s arrest and said he left Dubai legally.

On March 10 a Rwandan judge determined that Rusesabagina was deceived into coming back to Rwanda but was not kidnapped and thus the charges against him can't be dropped.

Human Rights Watch a New York-based international human rights watchdog said Rusesabagina's arrest ""amounted to an enforced disappearance a serious violation of international law"" and that ""Rwanda has an established track record of using unlawful cloak-and-dagger methods to target those it perceives to be a threat to the ruling party.""

Kagame is credited by some with turning Rwanda into an economic powerhouse for the East Africa region in the years after the devastating genocide. But others claim the reconstruction came at a price as Rwanda’s strongman leader has been consolidating power for decades and is known for sniffing out his opponents. Some of Kagame’s critics have even died under mysterious circumstances both in Rwanda and abroad.

'A sham trial'

The charges that Rusesabagina faces stem from his leadership of an exiled opposition coalition called the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change known by its French acronym MRCD. In 2018 there were a series of deadly attacks on villages in southern Rwanda near the country's border with Burundi and Rwandan authorities inculpated the National Liberation Front or FLN which is the armed wing of the MRCD. In a video statement released later that year Rusesabagina pledged his ""unreserved support"" for the FLN declared Kagame's government to be ""the enemy of the Rwandan people"" and called for ""any means possible to bring about change.""

In a pretrial hearing on Sept. 25 2020 Rusesabagina acknowledged that the MRCD had an armed wing but denied his involvement.

""We formed the FLN as an armed wing not as a terrorist group as the prosecution keeps saying. I do not deny that the FLN committed crimes but my role was diplomacy"" he told the court. ""The agreement we signed to form MRCD as a political platform included the formation of an armed wing called FLN. But my work was under the political platform and I was in charge of diplomacy.""

Belgian investigators at the request of Rwanda have previously questioned Rusesabagina about his alleged involvement in rebel groups. In October 2019 Belgian authorities searched Rusesabagina's residence near Brussels after declining to extradite him to Rwanda according to Eric Van Duyse spokesperson for the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office.

""Rwanda asked for extradition and we refused as he is a Belgian citizen and we opened an investigation"" Van Duyse told ABC News over the phone. ""We cannot share any details on the investigation because it is still ongoing.""

Although the file remains open the investigation is effectively on hold due to Rusesabagina's current status. The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office has had no contact with Rwandan authorities since Rusesabagina appeared in Kigali according to Van Duyse.

""This is something quite new for us in such a case"" he said ""because he was not supposed to be in Rwanda.""

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on whether its agents had ever summoned Rusesabagina for questioning as well.

Rusesabagina is being tried alongside 20 other defendants who are accused of being FLN organizers and fighters. The proceedings are expected to last several months. Rwandan officials refused to grant ABC News an interview with him from prison.

""Rusesabagina very early on was collaborating with groups that committed genocide here in '94 and that escaped to Congo"" Jean-Paul Kimonyo a former presidential adviser to Kagame told ABC News during an interview in Kigali. ""The evidence against him is overwhelming.""

Rusesabagina's family has denounced the proceedings as ""a sham trail"" in a ""kangaroo court.""

""If you're a dissident in Rwanda you can go to jail you can get imprisoned you know you can get killed"" Anaise Kanimba told ABC News. ""On top of that my father has a platform that President Kagame doesn't like. You know my father has been able to tell the world about what happens in Rwanda.""

Rusesabagina's legal team and loved ones have also expressed grave concern over the conditions in which he is being held. Rusesabagina who is a cancer survivor has been in solitary confinement in a Kigali prison for nearly seven months and has been denied his prescribed medication for a heart disorder according to Gibson. The United Nation's Nelson Mandela Rules state that keeping someone in solitary confinement for more than 15 consecutive days is torture.

Rusesabagina was initially denied access to any of his chosen counsel and still does not have access to his international lawyers including Gibson who has previously represented Rwandan accused before the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda. Rusesabagina is not given adequate time and resources to prepare for trial and the privileged documents provided to him by his Rwandan attorneys are routinely confiscated in prison according to Gibson.

""In any other jurisdiction any one of those violations would lead to the trial being permanently staid and the accused being released"" Gibson told ABC News. ""And here in Paul's case we just have a litany of violations that are open that we can see that no one is trying to hide. And the culmination of all those violations together should make it clear to the international community that a fair trial in Paul's case in Rwanda is no longer possible.""

Both Rusesabagina's family and lawyers have said they fear his fate is already sealed and that his only hope is for the international community to intervene.

The U.S. Department of State ""has engaged the government of Rwanda at the highest levels"" and ""will continue to do as the proceedings run apace"" according to spokesperson Ned Price who told reporters that Rusesabagina's trial must be ""fair and transparent."" In an open letter to Kagame in February 37 members of Congress called for Rusesabagina's release and return to the United States ""on humanitarian grounds."" Meanwhile the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for an international investigation into Rusesabagina's case and for Rwandan authorities to allow him a fair trial.

""I can already tell you he will be convicted. We've known that he will be convicted since the first day he arrived there"" Anaise Kanimba told ABC News. ""Are you going to allow my father to die in jail? Because I think that's really the fear.""

Grayback has finally been found.

It was hidden from discovery all this time by a single errant digit.

The mystery began on Jan. 28 1944 when the Grayback one of the most successful American submarines of World War II sailed out of Pearl Harbor for its 10th combat patrol. By late March it was more than three weeks overdue to return and the Navy listed the submarine as missing and presumed lost.

After the war the Navy tried to piece together a comprehensive history of the 52 submarines it had lost. The history issued in 1949 gave approximate locations of where each submarine had disappeared.

The Grayback was thought to have gone down in the open ocean 100 miles east-southeast of Okinawa. But the Navy had unknowingly relied on a flawed translation of Japanese war records that got one digit wrong in the latitude and longitude of the spot where the Grayback had probably met its end.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1hc2lhLTU2ODYwNzgx0gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWFzaWEtNTY4NjA3ODEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Afghanistan War: How can the West fight terrorism after leaving?,

You need to check this out…,"As the largest city in North America and one of the largest in the world Mexico City may be a bit daunting to first-time visitors. There’s enough to see and do in Mexico’s capital to fill various visits after all.

So where to start? To keep from being overwhelmed by the options it’s a good idea to break down the attractions and activities into categories.

Note: Most attractions and businesses in Mexico City were operating at reduced capacity and limited hours as of press time in accordance with the destination’s pandemic safety guidelines. Some facilities may be completely closed and those that are open likely require temperature checks and face masks. Be sure to confirm operating hours before making plans to visit any attraction.

Here are some of the top attractions for first-time visitors.

History Lessons

Square one for history lovers in Mexico City is the Zocalo one of the world’s largest city squares which sits in the heart of the historic downtown a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here visitors can view what remains of the Templo Mayor a former temple of the Mexica people who thrived in the region back when the city was called Tenochtitlan. Spanish colonists destroyed most of the temple in 1521 to make room for the massive cathedral which is another must-see in downtown Mexico City.

It’s easy to travel across centuries in a matter of blocks in downtown Mexico City. At one end of the bustling pedestrian street called Calle Madero is the Torre Latinoamericana (Latin American Tower) which was the tallest building in Latin America when it opened in 1956; today the observation deck offers a rewarding view of the neighborhood’s architectural treasures including the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) a performing arts center that opened in 1934 and draws admirers with its live performances as well as its stunning Neoclassical and Art Nouveau façade and Art Deco interior.

Visitors can also find historical treasures inside Parque Chapultepec the massive city park that spans some 1700 acres. Perched atop a hillside is the Castillo de Chapultepec (Chapultepec Castle) which served as the official residence of Emperor Maximilian I from 1864 to 1867. The city’s short-lived imperial era is long gone but the castle now houses the Museo Nacional de Historia (National Museum of History) offering visitors an opportunity to learn more about the nation’s rich history as they explore the castle.

In the southern part of the city is Xochimilco which is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as the “only reminder of traditional pre-Hispanic land use in the lagoons of the Mexico City basin” according to the organization. The best way to appreciate the neighborhood’s lovely network of canals is to book a ride aboard a colorful trajinera boat.

Another must-see for anyone interested in the region’s pre-Hispanic history is Teotihuacan the ruins of a city founded sometime around 200 B.C. It’s best to plan an entire day to visit this breathtaking collection of pyramids and other structures which lies about 25 miles from the city.

Cultural Wonders

According to some estimates Mexico City has more museums than any other city on the planet (except perhaps London) and there are cultural facilities to suit just about every taste and interest. The crown jewel many would say is the Museo Nacional de Antropologia (National Museum of Anthropology) a massive facility dedicated to the region’s pre-Hispanic history and indigenous cultures.

Art lovers meanwhile should consider a visit to Casa Azul the blue house now also known as the Museo Frida Kahlo (Frida Kahlo Museum). The famed artist was born lived and died in this very home and a tour provides a fascinating glimpse into her creative genius. True fans of her work should also visit the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo (Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo House Studio Museum) which is set in the twin attached homes where the legendary couple lived and worked.

It is super-fast and does not need wires or towers to connect to the world wide web. Satellite broadband promises to be the next big thing and a slew of big names are ready to roll it out as early as next year reports ET’s Kalyan Parbat.Imagine sitting in a remote mountain village north of the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh and chatting with colleagues in Delhi or Bengaluru over an uninterrupted video call. Or watching a Clint Eastwood western on a laptop in the Andamans – without using a cellular network or wired broadband.This may soon turn into a reality once satellite broadband connections are rolled out across India likely as early as next year.Some of the biggest global names – including OneWeb SpaceX and Hughes - are betting big on the opportunity to deliver satellite-based fast internet services - anywhere anytime.OneWeb co-owned by Bharti Global and the UK government is launching high-speed satellite internet services in the country by mid-2022.Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX Technologies is looking to do the same next year with a maze of satellites. Hughes Communications India the local arm of US satellite maker Hughes Network Systems is also ready to invest in a $500 million satellite and pump in $300 million more on ground-level gear to deliver such connectivity.There is growing buzz around satellite broadband and the far-reaching implications of the internet-from-space race.“The future is probably shifting now. If you extrapolate this 10 years from now will there be ground networks at all? Who knows?” Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal told ET in a recent interaction. “Every month you will see a launch; we need to send 650 satellites; they will go up by April 2022. Then we’ll be up and running. This will be nothing but telecom in space.”OneWeb is in constant touch with the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and regulators to ensure all approvals for market access and landing rights are in place before it goes live in India Mittal’s UK-based son Shravin the managing director of Bharti Global and the one responsible for driving the group’s satellite business told ET separately.SpaceX is already offering a beta version of its Starlink satellite internet service on pre-orders.This comes with a refundable deposit of $99 (more than Rs 7000) in India.The Starlink beta service has even been opened up for pre-orders to potential customers in remote trans-Himalayan zones such as the Keylong-Leh road in the high-altitude Lahaul valley.Once operational the beta version alone will pack data speeds of 50-150 Mbps which will increase sharply once more satellites are put into orbit according to Starlink’s website.So why are these marquee names keen to enter the satellite broadband business in a country with a 63% reach of 4G services and one of the lowest mobile data rates in the world?While existing telecom networks have largely delivered broadband connectivity to consumers in urban and suburban areas industry experts say the Covid-19 pandemic painfully revealed how millions in India’s rural and remote corners still do not have access to fast internet or reliable mobile connections.“SpaceX’s Starlink high-capacity high-speed low-latency satellite network would advance the goal of delivering broadband connectivity to all Indians particularly those without access now or in the near-term to broadband services traditionally available only to customers in urban and suburban areas” said Patricia Cooper VP (satellite government affairs) of SpaceX responding to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's paper on broadband speeds.Nearly 75% of India’s rural population do not have access to broadband since many locations go without cellular or fibre connectivity according to the estimates of the Broadband India Forum (BIF) which represents OneWeb Hughes Amazon Google Facebook Microsoft and Qualcomm.Hence powerful next-generation satellite systems are being touted as a viable alternative to connect the unconnected.One reason why the likes of OneWeb and SpaceX are “attracted to the new stirrings in India's satellite broadband space is that satellite networks can be rolled out and scaled up a lot faster and more cost-effectively than terrestrial mobile/broadband networks especially to connect a sizable chunk of the population living in remote and inhospitable regions” says Mahesh Uppal a telecom analyst and director of Com First (India).Satellite internet players also do not have to worry about securing right-of-way clearances which typically slow down terrestrial broadband network rollouts.Last year finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would create a level-playing field for private satellite builders satellite launchers and space-based service providers under its new space communication policy which would ring in a predictable regulatory regime.Once the ‘Open Space’ policy is fully operational satellite broadband services can be a $500 million-plus near-term market opportunity the Satcom Industry Association (SIA-India) says.At present satellite broadband services in India are a primarily B2B play with a market size of roughly $100 million.Satellite broadband is a key connectivity solution – for banks with numerous branches in remote areas where mobile coverage and wired internet are unreliable or even small and medium enterprises operating in far-flung regions.The biggest potential money spinner - in a B2B scenario - is to use satellites to boost mobile broadband coverage in rural areas where there is not enough mobile towers or terrestrial backhaul links via fibre networks industry executives point out.“We believe satellite broadband can provide the vital ‘backhaul’ or connectivity between mobile towers and a telco’s core mobile network in rural areas to ensure uninterrupted mobile coverage in such regions” K Krishna vice president and CTO at Hughes Communications India told ET.The revenue opportunity is significant.Each remote tower would need at least 20 Mbps to deliver cellular backhaul via satellite.Since every Mbps of satellite connectivity can garner an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 16000-Rs 20000 a month the potential monthly ARPU for a satcom operator providing such connectivity in a remote area can be as much as Rs 3.2-Rs 4 lakh per month.However satellite broadband will not see mass consumer traction like mobile services unless satellite internet rates crash.At present these services are priced at around $15-$20 per GB in India about 22-30 times higher than the $0.68 charged per GB for mobile data.There are several reasons why this is so.Satcom operators in India have no access to high-throughput satellites offering 100-500 Gbps of bandwidth. This is because most conventional satellites (with low transponder capacity) are run by Isro and offer only a maximum 12 Gbps. These are largely reserved for government programmes hampering commercial satcom services.Satcom players also cannot lease bandwidth capacity directly from foreign satellite operators.They have to go via the Department of Space (DoS) which pushes up final leasing costs by around 15-20% including a withholding tax component.“Hughes provides satellite broadband services to consumers in many markets but for this service to be viable and successful (in India) the input cost of capacity has to be substantially lower than what it is today” Krishna says.Current leasing costs “are in the range of Rs 75000 per Mbps per month which is 10 times the global average of Rs 7500” he says.The rates will fall sharply only if a satellite service provider is able to control every cost element like in the mature satellite markets.In the United States satellite companies like SpaceX Hughes or Viasat own operate and launch satellites. They also directly deliver satellite internet services to consumers. This is akin to telcos who buy spectrum roll out networks and offer mobile services.In India though the case is different.A potential satellite broadband operator will first need to lease bandwidth at a higher cost through DoS. They will then have to separately seek a VSAT permit from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) or enter into a third-party pact with an existing VSAT permit-holder before offering satellite internet services. Multiple intermediaries end up hiking the cost of services.Further bandwidth leasing agreements are only for a year or less despite a satellite’s 15-year lifespan. This artificially increases costs due to the uncertainties around foreign satellite capacity utilisation making satellite broadband rates unaffordable.Industry experts say such leasing contracts should be for a minimum of three years. India’s dependence on foreign satellite operators will not disappear overnight they say since Isro satellites meet only around 50% of the country’s needs.India is working on building high throughput satellites -- offering more than 100 Gbps bandwidth capacity -- but there are no timelines yet.“There is an insatiable demand for broadband connectivity but there simply isn’t enough domestic satellite capacity to serve this growing demand in India” says Anil Prakash director general SIA-India.Isro did not reply to ET’s detailed queries while questions to OneWeb and SpaceX also went unanswered.Pricing of satellite broadband services can plunge to as little as $1 per GB -- on par with global rates -- if satcom operators can directly lease bandwidth from foreign operators and access very high-throughput satellites.Going forward satellite broadband can become the backbone for networks of Internet of Things (IoT) devices smart factories utilities and other systems that require complex machine-to-machine communications according to brokerage CLSA.The satellite industry is also hopeful that the government may allow 100% foreign direct investment through the automatic route.The industry though is wary of DoS’s current combined role as licensor market regulator and satellite operator. This they say is leading to a conflict of interest with private satellite makers and satcom service providers.In its recent submissions to the government on the draft satcom policy the VSAT Services Association of India has suggested that DoS’s role should be segregated.BIF is also of the view that DoS must only evaluate proposals for authorisation of satellite capacity. It should not be a party in commercial contracts between satellite operators and service providers it says.",,,,,,

Why Is There No Money ...,"PENSACOLA Florida—As the sun set over Pensacola Bay Dixie Wilkinson sat in a lawn chair on her back porch overlooking her carefully tended yard that slopes toward the water. She gazed at the sinewy oak tree in the middle of the freshly cut grass the same tree she had played under as a child.

The silence of the dusk surrounding her was broken only by a distant train whistle and the fluttering of wind chimes hanging from her carport.

Wilkinson thought about the land that she and generations of her family were raised on. “I would not want to live anywhere else. I’ve gone to different places all over. But this is my you know this is the place I love” she said with a soft southern drawl gesturing towards her yard.

Yet the soil and the groundwater in her neighborhood have been poisoned over the years and she believes the contaminants have sickened her and her neighbors.

Wilkinson 66 lives less than 100 yards from the old American Creosote Works one of the country’s worst hazardous waste sites. It was so laced with carcinogenic dioxins from treating railroad ties and telephone poles with creosote that the Environmental Protection Agency put it on a new list of the worst so-called Superfund sites in 1983.

It’s been on the list ever since only now there is no funding in the federal budget to finish the cleanup.

The 18-acre site three blocks north of Pensacola Bay is one of just five Superfund sites nationwide that the EPA considers an uncontrolled threat to human health and at risk of climate change-related events like flooding and hurricanes according to an Inside Climate News analysis of EPA data.

As recently as last September—days before Hurricane Sally dumped 30 inches of rain on Pensacola in four hours and left an oil slick-like sheen on the streets of Wilkinson’s Sanders Beach neighborhood—the EPA found dioxin levels in the soil of nearby homes that were well above Florida’s safety standard for the toxin: one sample came back 35 times higher.

Earlier in the year the EPA found naphthalene which has been linked with neurological and liver disease in one groundwater sample at more than 785 times the level of Florida’s groundwater cleanup standard.

In his $2 trillion infrastructure plan President Biden has proposed reimposing a tax on potential corporate polluters to help pay for Superfund cleanups. While the tax which Congress let expire in 1995 faces an uncertain future an international coalition of environmentalists and lawyers has begun a global campaign to make this type of systemic long-lasting environmental devastation an international crime called “ecocide” before the International Criminal Court. The campaign’s future is also uncertain—and even if ecocide were to become an international crime five or six years from now it would have no bearing on sites like the American Creosote Works. The United States is not a member of the court and at times has been critical of the institution.

But those behind the campaign and many U.S. environmentalists say the ecocide framework remains highly relevant for assessing America’s Superfund sites and other examples of widespread environmental damage in moral terms. The nation’s existing laws and courts have failed to protect the environment and safeguard public health and environmental damage in one country can lead to climate change felt worldwide.

“Superfund sites in America are living examples of the worst instances of ecocide within our borders and are almost exclusively located in or next to communities of color” said Scott W. Badenoch Jr. an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide.

For decades Wilkinson a retired police administrator had fought to get the American Creosote site cleaned up. But time and inaction weathered her resolve leading her to believe that she was unlikely to see things change during her lifetime.

Then in December 2016 she met her new next-door neighbor a 30-year-old bartender and nutritionist named Kelly Hagen.

Shortly after Hagen and her partner moved into their new pale gray three-bedroom home they discovered a rotting odor coming from underneath the house. Hagen pulled on a white protective suit and without flinching disappeared into the crawl space.

Wilkinson watched from behind the chest-high brown picket fence dividing the two properties as Hagen emerged with a decaying possum in hand. “I think I’m going to like her” Wilkinson said to her husband.

At the time Hagen didn’t even know what a Superfund site was. But soon the fight was on.

The Wood Preservation Industry: A Legacy of Toxic Pollution

Along with coal and iron wood was an important natural resource for fueling the fire of the American Industrial Revolution. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries timber much of which flowed through the Port of Pensacola was used to build homes bridges ships and railroads.

By 1909 the nation was cutting forests down three times faster than they could grow according to the U.S. Forest Service.

The country’s voracious appetite for wood sparked an odd alliance between conservationists concerned with environmental protection and industrialists worried that lumber scarcity would drive up prices. The coalition began championing the use of chemicals like the coal-distillate creosote to preserve timber products. The technology works by pressure-treating wood to kill insects and prevent natural decay extending the average life of timber from seven to 40 years.

But in attempting to solve one environmental problem humans created another.

Public documents and court records dating back to the early 1900s show that the wood-preservation industry—including American Creosote Works—fought off workers’ claims that creosote exposure made them sick and caused skin burns and irritation.

Today the EPA recognizes creosote as a probable human carcinogen that contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs such as naphthalene.

The American Creosote Works plant in Pensacola operated from 1902 to 1981. Workers there treated timber with the tar-like creosote for use in telephone poles railroad ties and bridge beams and left the wood outside to drip-dry. In 1950 the company started also using pentachlorophenol or PCP a dioxin-containing chemical used to preserve wood.

Dioxins are a variety of persistent organic pollutants that have long been considered some of the most toxic chemicals in the world. They can cause cancer reproductive and developmental problems damage to the immune system and can interfere with hormones according to the EPA. Dioxins were also byproducts found in Agent Orange the herbicide and defoliant sprayed over dense jungles during the Vietnam War.

Waste from American Creosote Works was routinely dumped into evaporation ponds and unlined pits. Contaminants seeped into the earth and flowed into nearby Pensacola Bay and Bayou Chico.

Growing up next door in Sanders Beach in the 1960s Wilkinson regularly scrubbed her creosote-drenched cats and dogs in a steel galvanized tub on her parents’ back porch. “It was gooey oily and smelly” she said. “And it was not easy to get off … you never got rid of the smell.”

Back then Sanders Beach was primarily a working-class neighborhood with many residents working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Wilkinson’s father had three. “I don’t know if we made it to middle-class but we were better off than some down here” she said referring in part to workers at American Creosote.

Victor Alexander a pastor and Air Force veteran grew up next door to Sanders Beach in a predominantly-Black area called The Tanyard Community from 1963 to 1974. Alexander 66 said part of survival for his community meant growing their own food. “You always had a garden” he remembered. “Collard greens turnip greens you know mustard greens black-eyed peas peas or string beans.”

Shavings from discarded pieces of pine from American Creosote treated with that dark sticky foul-smelling substance helped those gardens to flourish when mixed with topsoil. Alexander’s father along with other men from The Tanyard collected the wood—gloves were unaffordable—and piled it into cars. Those pine shavings were also used to make footpaths in the neighborhood’s numerous gardens Alexander said and just about everyone walked through them barefoot.

It would be years until Tanyard residents fully realized what dangers they were bringing back home. “We operated out of ignorance because knowledge was withheld from us” he said. “Looking back a lot of playmates colleagues that grew up in the area have passed on. Unfortunately a majority have passed on by some form of cancer.”

Alexander the oldest of seven children came down with prostate cancer at 44 and two of his sisters have had breast cancer. He acknowledges that there were many contaminants back then—like the waste treatment facility dubbed “Ol’ Stinky” just a few blocks away—and that it’s difficult to draw a straight line from any illness back to American Creosote Works. But still he wonders.

“It did affect us” Alexander said. “Not just affect us it infected us. But compensation was never something that was received especially in that community.”

After more than 75 years of unchecked pollution Florida began monitoring the American Creosote Works site bringing its first enforcement action against the company in 1981.

A year later American Creosote Works filed for bankruptcy according to EPA records. Around the same time other wood treatment plants across the country took the same tack effectively evading liability for cleanup costs which can be upwards of $50 million per site.

The industry’s legacy of toxic creosote and dioxin pollution affects mostly poor communities and has been largely overlooked as one of the country’s biggest historical industrial polluters. Today the use of creosote and other wood-treatment chemicals is allowable though regulated. And the EPA is in the process of performing a 15-year review of creosote and other heavy-duty wood preservatives to determine whether the chemicals can “carry out their intended function without creating unreasonable risks to human health and the environment.”

The Creosote Council a pro-industry group that promotes the use of creosote as environmentally friendly declined to comment.

The Superfund Program Is Born

Two years before American Creosote Works went bankrupt Congress in 1980 passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The law gave the EPA then just 10 years old the authority and funds to identify and regulate the nation’s toxic waste sites that posed a threat to human health.

Originally funded in large part by a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries lawmakers intended the measure to hold polluting companies responsible for cleaning up their own messes. If the companies couldn’t afford to pay for it or no responsible party could be found the program charged the EPA for the cleanup using money from the Superfund Trust.

In 1983 the American Creosote Works became one of the first sites placed by the EPA on the National Priorities List a grouping of some of the most toxic places in America. It’s been there ever since despite about $30 million in remedial cleanup work done already. The EPA estimates there have been about 90 former wood treatment sites on the National Priorities List.

While a 1985 study from the EPA linked exposure to dioxins with liver and neurological damage such as impairment to sensory functions the first health assessment at American Creosote carried out in 1986 by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services incorrectly determined there to be no threat.

Early one summer morning two years later Wilkinson then a young mother and her brother took his 28-foot sailboat out into Pensacola Bay. Not long after they set sail Wilkinson collapsed onto the deck of the boat in a wave of pain and was rushed to the hospital.

She had ignored the aching in her left side for months but she couldn’t ignore this. Doctors discovered a tumor on her pancreas the source of the pain and separately diagnosed colon cancer. The event shifted something for Wilkinson a healthy 34-year-old with no family history of cancer. In the years to come she suffered from a series of grapefruit-sized tumors in her abdomen.

After the diagnoses she began to see the past in a new light questioning why multiple neighbors had gotten sick with cancer and multiple sclerosis at young ages some of them teenagers.

“I can’t prove any of that had anything to do with growing up here but it is odd” she said.

No longer walking barefoot in the grass digging into the ground to garden or letting her son play in the yard Wilkinson’s relationship with the place she loved began to change.

The Third Largest Environmental Evacuation in U.S. History

Although workers first found a creosote-like substance in groundwater in 1980 the area wasn’t deemed a public health hazard until 1992 in an assessment by the Florida Department of Health.

By then 3.5 miles north of American Creosote residents in mostly Black neighborhoods were complaining about a similar plant nearby Escambia Wood Treating Company. It too went bankrupt and became a notorious Superfund site known locally as “Mt. Dioxin.” It too sat for decades on the National Priorities List despite local officials touting big plans for repurposing the land after its cleanup. The site even received one of Florida’s first-ever Brownfield grants the federal program that aims to clean up and then repurpose old industrial properties.

Wilma Subra a chemist and environmental scientist who consulted on behalf of the residents said that anyone who came in contact with dioxin-contaminated soil would potentially risk bioaccumulation—the absorption of a chemical into an organism faster than it can be expelled. According to the World Health Organization dioxins remain in the human body for seven to 11 years.

Contaminated groundwater on the other hand “can take decades to a century or more to clean up” Subra said.

Given the dioxin levels found in the soil and the naphthalene detected in groundwater around the American Creosote Works she believes the level of environmental devastation there could be described as “ecocide.”

When the EPA finally investigated the Escambia Woods site it found dioxin levels so atrocious that it evacuated four entire neighborhoods in 1996 and permanently moved the residents into new homes in what remains the third-largest environmental relocation in U.S. history.

But by then the decline of the Superfund program had already begun. A year earlier Republicans in Congress allowed the tax on polluting industries to expire. Industry lobbyists were gaining support in their argument that the tax was unfair and a larger anti-tax political movement led by the Republican party was growing across the country said Jim Woolford a former EPA official who ran the Superfund program from 2006 until he retired last April.

The Superfund Trust which peaked at $4.7 billion in 1997 soon dwindled to a fraction of that amount: at the beginning of 2021 the program’s budget sat at just $75 million. Without the polluters’ tax the Superfund program relied almost entirely on Congressional appropriations. But that too has fallen to the whims of politics Woolford said.

As the years carried on and old and unfinished projects became more costly to clean up Woolford said more sites were added to the Superfund program—there are now 1327 on the National Priorities List.

“I wouldn’t call it the perfect storm but it is a bad storm because your buying power is going down the sites are more costly and Congressional appropriations are going down as well” he said.

The Long Fight to Cleanup Creosote

Keith Wilkins affable and soft-spoken joined Escambia County as its natural resources and community redevelopment director in 1998. There was still money in the Superfund Trust. He dreamed of cleaning up the Escambia Wood creosote site and turning it into a park or a commercial hub for new businesses.

But for one reason or another—whether it was the state taking years to negotiate dioxin safety standards with the EPA or the county struggling with liability issues and lining up buyers—the dream never materialized.

Officials with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment and deferred questions to the EPA.

The Escambia Woods plot remains empty to this day Wilkins said. “There’s nothing there.”

He hit the same roadblocks working to clean up the American Creosote site again with the goal of turning it into a park and the lack of progress over 17 years has been a huge blow to him.

More than a decade into his quest a 2009 study by researchers at the University of West Florida found sediments beneath Sanders Beach to be heavily polluted. The researchers discovered creosote and high concentrations of PAHs which have been linked to cancer in the aquifer beneath the site as well.

The study also warned that eating seafood caught in Pensacola Bay could lead to exposure to dioxins a fact that has prompted many residents to swear off eating fish caught in the bay or food grown in nearby soil. Around the same time two health studies done on communities living near other wood treatment plants found residents had significantly elevated levels of dioxin in their blood compared with control groups.

In 2015 when Wilkins left the county with retirement in mind he took some solace from the fact that nearly all of the cleanup at the Escambia Woods site had been completed. As he began discussing positions with the city of Pensacola there seemed to be no one left to carry on his fight in county government which is responsible for managing and redeveloping Superfund sites after cleanup.

Then Kelly Hagen moved in next door to Dixie Wilkinson.

When the plucky newcomer bought her home on South I Street Hagen had no idea how toxic the site just a few feet away actually was. “I didn’t know what a Superfund site was at that time” she said. “I’ve learned a lot.”

Over time she would become vice president of the Sanders Beach Neighborhood Association and sit on Pensacola’s Environmental Advisory Board energized by Wilkinson’s deep-rooted connection to Sanders Beach and her own desire for a safe neighborhood.

When the EPA tested Hagen’s yard for dioxins in 2019 as part of its remedial design for cleaning up the site it found dioxins at 14 parts per trillion between the surface and six inches deep twice the State of Florida’s minimum level for cleanup of seven parts per trillion for residential properties.

Samples taken in 2018 in Wilkinson’s yard found dioxins at 17 parts per trillion. The EPA told both in letters describing the results that removal of the soil from their yards would begin after the summer of 2019 “if EPA funding is available.”

The dioxin-laced soil has yet to be touched.

“I started to learn more and more” Hagen said. “And being on the board you know I decided that that was going to be like my main focus … What the heck what’s going on? Where are we at in this process? Why isn’t it moving forward? How do we get it to move forward? What else needs to happen?”

When the EPA tested 54 groundwater wells in March 2020 for naphthalene a toxic compound derived from coal tar that is considered a possible human carcinogen five of the samples came back between 1600 micrograms per liter and 11000 micrograms per liter. The state’s cleanup level for naphthalene is 14 micrograms per liter.

The University of West Florida researchers took several samples from different fish species and found in many of them concentrations of dioxin above EPA screening levels which are discretionary guidelines used at hazardous waste sites. But they said the lack of previous data made it impossible to determine how these levels had changed over time; there are no federal or state regulations for monitoring the bioaccumulation of dioxins in fish.

If the EPA ever gets around to cleaning up the site and her property Hagen said she still won’t eat anything from the ground or caught in the bay. “No matter what even after the cleanup” she said. “I just won’t—I won’t do it.”

In the Aftermath of Hurricane Sally an Oil Slick

The threat represented by uncontrolled dioxins and other toxic chemicals leaking from the American Creosote Superfund site was made clear in dramatic fashion last year when Hurricane Sally a slow-moving Category 2 storm made landfall in Pensacola at 8 p.m. on Sept. 16 and dumped up to 30 inches of rain in four hours.

Climate scientists say that warming oceans are intensifying hurricanes and greatly increasing the amount of rainfall they bring often leading to significant flooding.

Wilkinson whose roof was damaged by the storm rode out the hurricane on her couch with Jackson her Australian Shepherd. As the storm let up a colorful sheen appeared in the water puddled on the sides of the street like an oil slic and a gasoline-like smell filled the air.

“Have you ever walked on a railroad track on a hot day? Yeah like that. Sort of tar-y” said Hagen.

Shortly before the hurricane the EPA took 46 soil samples around Sanders Beach. Nine came back between seven and 30 parts per trillion for dioxins. But one was found to have 120 and another had 250 parts per trillion. EPA’s default minimum level for cleaning up dioxins is 50 parts per trillion compared with Florida’s seven parts per trillion.

Subra the chemist and environmental scientist who first consulted for the Escambia Woods residents back in the 1990s said she still considers Florida’s seven parts per trillion standard—the toughest in the country—unsafe for residents like Wilkinson and Hagen.

“It is totally not sufficient to reduce exposure for people to live on” she said.

Hagen remembers how hard she had to push Peter Thorpe the EPA official overseeing the cleanup to do testing after Hurricane Sally to determine what levels of dioxins and other chemicals were washed off the site by that much rain.

“It’s not something I should have to be asking for them to do” she said. “It should be done any time there’s a major storm. And I’ve still not heard back from them on the dioxin reports.”

In an email EPA spokesperson Brandi Jenkins said the agency tested the soils and wells around the site shortly after being informed of community concerns experienced travel delays due to the pandemic and “rushed for the fastest laboratory turnaround time possible.”

The soil samples though not from Wilkinson’s or Hagen’s yards came back below Florida’s safety standards but the water samples had site-related contaminants “consistent with previous sampling results” which exceeded safe standards including the EPA’s standard for PCP.

Despite all the concern over dioxins the city issued a construction permit after the hurricane to Hagen’s neighbors who wanted to remodel their home next to the Superfund site. Hagen watched from her second-story bedroom window as the crew cut down another of the neighborhood’s old oak trees to make way for an inground pool.

The workers operating without any protective equipment took the timber and soil to a nearby landfill unaware of the dioxins that might be embedded in the material. Hagen expressed frustration that there was no warning that contaminated dust would be disturbed over the course of two days.

Wilkins the former county natural resources director who became Pensacola’s city administrator in 2019 acknowledged that the city overlooked a possible hazard. “There’s no cross referencing” between departments he said. “It falls through the cracks just bureaucratically and it’s very frustrating.”

Petitioning Congress for $34 Million

Earlier this month Hagen sat cross-legged on her couch looking over a letter she and other members of the Sanders Beach Neighborhood Association plan to send to their Congressional representatives asking them to support increased funding for Superfund cleanups. Wilkinson was one of the first to sign.

Halfway through her pregnancy Hagen still plans to canvass the neighborhood and gather as many signatures as she can.

While the American Creosote site is among 34 “unfunded” Superfund locations the EPA has previously put a $34.1 million price tag on the last stage of the cleanup according to EPA documents. The plan calls for soil from neighboring yards like Hagen’s to be removed and replaced.

Escambia County which was allocated over $80 million from British Petroleum’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill has not earmarked any funds for the cleanup. County Natural Resources Director Chips Kirschenfeld said the idea “may warrant a discussion” but the county would need assurances the federal government would provide reimbursement.

Much of the pollution remaining on the Superfund site itself will be contained with a 100-foot underground barrier wall and a concrete cap. The process to get to this stage with a final cleanup plan approved has been long complicated and expensive costing about $30 million.

Now that the state and EPA have agreed on a final remediation plan the last hurdle is for the Superfund Priority Panel a group of program experts to decide the site is enough of a priority compared with other sites to receive funding.

Other developments in Washington could help in the long term.

President Biden proposed reinstating the polluters’ tax to help fund the Superfund Trust in his $2 trillion “American Jobs Plan” as the administration prioritizes climate change and environmental justice as key components of its regulatory agenda.

EPA Press Secretary Nick Conger said in a written statement that the agency is waiting for congressional funding to complete the final clean up of American Creosote Works. “In the event that Congress agrees with President Biden to provide such an increase to the program in the final budget EPA will be better positioned to address projects that are awaiting funding such as the American Creosote Works site” he said.

U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer an Oregon Democrat introduced his own plan this week to reinstate the tax. The Superfund Reinvestment Act is estimated to bring in about $1.7 billion per year and $18.9 billion over 10 years according to Blumenauer’s office.

Blumenauer has introduced a version of the bill every two years since the late 1990s to no avail. But this year he thinks it has a good chance of passing with Democrats running majorities in both Congressional chambers and the new administration showing early support.

“The intersection of these issues in terms of environmental justice environmental cleanup climate issues it’s a perfect convergence of forces” Blumenauer said “and I think we’re going to get it.”

The need is overwhelming. At least 945 of the nation’s Superfund sites are vulnerable to the increasing threat of hurricanes flooding sea level rise heavy rainfall or wildfires as the planet warms—all of which can spread toxic materials into communities or ecosystems where they endanger human health and wildlife.

The 1327 hazardous waste sites on the National Priorities List mean that approximately one in six Americans lives within three miles of a Superfund site according to a 2020 report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group a nonprofit organization.

Another recent nationwide study from researchers at the University of Houston found that those who live near a Superfund site have their life expectancy decreased by more than two months. For communities burdened by poverty and other negative socioeconomic factors nearly 15 months of life can be lost. Having spent her life in Sanders Beach next to the American Creosote site the finding hits home for Wilkinson.

Next door Hagen headed out one morning last week on her blue and silver Trek bike with her 10-and-a-half-pound poodle Lexi in her backpack to canvas the neighborhood of about 200 homes. She dropped off copies of her letter for people to read sign and send back. So far 30 have returned.

Old-timers told her about past neighbors who died of cancer. Newcomers to Sanders Beach said they had health concerns: “‘Is it safe to drink the water? Is my yard contaminated?’ They don’t know how to get that information.”

Her goal is 100 signatures. “It’s going to be time-consuming and exhausting repeating myself multiple times a day” she said “But if I’m not going to do it how else is it going to get done?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Results were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Virtual Meeting Experience 2021.

""Many people with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis still report challenges in managing their symptoms which can have a significant impact on their daily lives despite the availability of existing topical treatment options"" said Linda Stein Gold MD director of dermatology clinical research at Henry Ford Health System Detroit Michigan and lead investigator for the ADVANCE study. ""The ADVANCE findings demonstrated that oral apremilast significantly improved clinical measures of disease severity such as Body Surface Area and scalp involvement.""

In ADVANCE oral Otezla 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement of the primary endpoint of static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) response at week 16 compared to placebo (21.6% vs 4.1% p<0.0001). These clinical improvements were maintained through week 32.

Otezla also demonstrated improvements in all secondary endpoints at week 16. A greater proportion of adults with BSA ≤5% treated with Otezla compared to placebo achieved a BSA ≤3% (respectively 71.7% vs 35.8%) at least a 75% improvement in BSA (29.0% vs 6.1%) and a Scalp PGA (ScPGA) response score of clear or almost clear (35.6% vs 12.9%).

Comparable improvements in disease severity were seen in adults with BSA >5% in ADVANCE. At week 16 a greater proportion of adults with BSA >5% treated with Otezla compared to placebo achieved a BSA ≤3% (respectively 54.6% vs 14.9%) at least a 75% improvement in BSA (36.8% vs 8.6%) and a ScPGA response score of clear or almost clear (50.6% vs 19.2%).

The adverse events observed in this trial analysis were consistent with the known safety profile of Otezla. The most commonly reported (≥5%) treatment-emergent adverse events with Otezla treatment were diarrhea (14.3%) headache (12.9%) nausea (12.7%) upper respiratory tract infection (8.5%) and nasopharyngitis (6.8%).

""These positive ADVANCE results add to the growing evidence supporting the potential benefit of Otezla in adults with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis"" said David M. Reese MD executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA to potentially expand access to oral Otezla to adults with mild to moderate disease severity.""

In February 2021 Amgen submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Otezla for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis based on the Phase 3 ADVANCE data.

In the U.S. Otezla is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and for adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease. Since its initial FDA approval in 2014 Otezla has been prescribed to more than 250000 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S.

Offshore fixed-in-place wind farms are not new but they are providing renewable power in many locations around the world. But there’s a limit to the water depth — and thus distance offshore — that these wind-power sources can be located: about 60 meters (~200 feet) deep typically corresponding to an offshore distance of a few miles depending on the ocean-floor drop-off at the continental shelf.

However there is an alternative “grounding” system being explored for the deeper-water wind farms: floating towers. Instead of being inserted into steel tubes buried in the seabed as is usually the case for fixed wind farms these generating turbines are tethered to the sea floor in various ways. One such floating system is the Hywind Scotland in use since 2017 Figure 1.

Why go so far offshore? There are several reasons:

The winds tend to be stronger and more consistent.

Many of the suitable close-to-shore locations are already taken.

It provides an opportunity to build bigger more powerful more cost-effective towers and generators.

The environmental approvals are easier to get.

The visual impact is far less; due to the curvature of the Earth (sorry flatlanders!) these wind farms are not visible to observers once they are more than 25 to 30 miles away depending on their height.

But — and it’s a very big “but” — the technical challenges of building these farms are considerable for many reasons. Obviously construction of these big structures in deep water is difficult complicated and costly while maintenance is also a costly ongoing issue due to the salty sea water fog and storms as well as the usual wear and tear. A rough guideline is that it costs about twice as much to build and maintain a floating system compared to a fixed-in-place non-floating of the same capacity. In an ironic twist some of the electrical power generated by such systems may be used to power offshore oil and gas drilling platforms!

The Hywind Scotland with five towers and turbines is operated by Norwegian oil company Equinor ASA and is located in the North Sea off the east coast of Scotland in water more than 90 meters (~300 feet) deep Figure 2.

Its website provides these basic high-level specifics:

The wind farm will provide enough electricity to power the equivalent of around 36000 households.

The farm consists of five 6 MW turbines with a total installed capacity of 30 MW and a transmission voltage of 33 kV.

The rotor diameter is 154 meters and overall height is 253 meters.

The pilot farm will cover around 4 square kilometers in water depths varying between 95 and 129 meters.

The average wind speed in this area of the North Sea is around 10 meter/second while the average wave height is 1.8 meters.

The export cable length to shore is 30 km (about 18 miles).

From mechanical materials and construction-engineering perspectives even this “modest” arrangement is a very substantial undertaking. Other more ambitious floating systems are in the planning and financing stages.

As with most engineering designs there are alternative ways to solve a given problem such as anchoring the floating structure Figure 3 (the IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) reference listed below has an interesting table detailing the pros and cons of the three options as well as their demonstration status).

What about the electrical power output and transmission? We’re looking at some very big numbers here no doubt of it. The Hywind Scotland project delivers peak power of 30 megawatts at 33 kilovolts which corresponds to current of just under 1000 A. There are issues of insulation integrity and potential flashover as well as the substantial cable needed to carry that magnitude of current with acceptably low IR loss (just do the math) and I2R self-heating along the 30 km run (fortunately the ocean offers excellent convection cooling). One nice feature is that optical fibers can be incorporated into the cable design for a data link between generator system and land-based control center.

In addition to the cable-conductor diameter the outer insulation and protective sheathing must prevent any ingress of water or moisture into the insulation which would compromise its properties. This barrier needs to be thick enough to provide reliable protection but not so thick that it resists the cable’s flexing.Yet it must also withstand the constant dynamic movement without fatigue cracking.

Of course the cable itself is only part of the story. It has to be terminated and terminations for 1000 A conductors in these applications are not off-the-shelf catalog items. Three types of terminations are needed: one at the turbine side one at the landing side and the ones that splice together the outputs of the individual turbines before the single-cable link to shore.

There’s much more information available about these floating wind farms in the references below. Since much of the material is from proponents and boosters of these systems the content tends to be upbeat not surprisingly. These are ambitious and somewhat audacious projects and it will be interesting to see how well they work out versus the plans and promises. Will these floating wind farms be successful and by which metrics should that success be measured? It is too early to know and the sample size is too small. They offer many potential benefits but the technical and cost challenges are significant. It may turn out that their financial and performance viability is closely aligned with the specific location and available alternatives.

Will the harsh sea defeat these well-intended projects? Or will careful and comprehensive design construction and installation — plus lots of money of course — make them generally successful? And to those engineers who worry about milliwatts and nanoamps all I can say is this: you don’t know how easy you have it in comparison!

AirDrop lets you share photos documents and other files with other Apple devices nearby. When users have Bluetooth and WiFi turned on they can discover each others' devices and connect and share.

But the discovery process can also leave your device open to potential data pirates say computer science researchers at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.

In a recently published alert the researchers said strangers within range of your device can learn your email address and phone number when you open the sharing function. That's because as part of the process to authenticate file sharing AirDrop checks phone numbers and email addresses against the other user's address book.

You don't have to initiate a connection with the other device for it to potentially eavesdrop and that represents ""a severe privacy leak"" the researchers said. Several outlets including 9to5Mac.com have reported on the flaw.

Even though the data shared in AirDrop authentications has privacy protections – cryptography measures called hash functions – those ""hash values can be quickly reversed using simple techniques such as brute-force attacks"" the researchers said. With your email address and phone number discovered you could be more at risk for phishing attempts and other scams.

The researchers say they notified Apple about the vulnerability nearly two years ago but Apple ""has neither acknowledged the problem nor indicated that they are working on a solution"" they said. ""This means that the users of more than 1.5 billion Apple devices are still vulnerable to the outlined privacy attacks.""

They suggest users of Apple devices disable AirDrop – ""Go to Settings>General>AirDrop>Receiving Off"" – and not open the sharing menu. When you really need to share files just turn the function back on and turn it off when you are finished.

Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment on the alert. On its AirDrop instruction page Apple suggests that users ""make sure that the person you're sending to is nearby and within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range.""

The German researchers also said they designed a ""PrivateDrop"" feature to replace AirDrop with improved privacy protections and ""authentication delay well below one second""

When the third minute of Apple’s first product event of 2021 ticked over and they had already made 3 announcements we knew it was going to be a packed one. In a tight single hour this week Apple launched a ton of new product including AirTags new Apple Card family sharing a new Apple TV a new set of colorful iMacs and a purple iPhone 12 shade.

Of the new devices announced though Apple’s new 12.9” iPad Pro is the most interesting from a market positioning perspective.

This week I got a chance to speak to Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak and Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus about this latest version of the iPad Pro and its place in the working universe of computing professionals.

In many ways this new iPad Pro is the equivalent of a sprinter being lengths ahead going into the last lap and just turning on the afterburners to put a undebatable distance between themselves and the rest of the pack. Last year’s model is still one of the best computers you can buy with a densely packed offering of powerful computing tools battery performance and portability. And this year gets upgrades in the M1 processor RAM storage speed Thunderbolt connection 5G radio new ultra wide front camera and its Liquid Retina XDR display.

This is a major bump even while the 2020 iPad Pro still dominates the field. And at the center of that is the display.

Apple has essentially ported its enormously good $5000 Pro Display XDR down to a 12.9” touch version with some slight improvements. But the specs are flat out incredible. 1000 nit brightness peaking at 1600 nits in HDR with 2500 full array local dimming zones — compared to the Pro Display XDR’s 576 in a much larger scale.

Given that this year’s first product launch from Apple was virtual the media again got no immediate hands on with the new devices introduced including iPad Pro. This means that I have not yet seen the XDR display in action. Unfortunately these specs are so good that estimating them without having seen the screen yet is akin to trying to visualize “a trillion” in your head. It’s intellectually possible but not really practical.

It’s brighter than any Mac or iOS device on the market and could be a big game shifting device for professionals working in HDR video and photography. But even still this is a major investment to ship a micro-LED display in the millions or tens of millions of units with more density and brightness than any other display on the market.

I ask both of them why there’s a need to do this doubling down on what is already one of the best portable displays ever made — if not one of the best displays period.

“We’ve always tried to have the best display” says Ternus. “We’re going from the best display on any device like this and making it even better because that’s what we do and that’s why we we love coming to work every day is to take that next big step.

“[With the] Pro Display XDR if you remember one thing we talked about was being able to have this display and this capability in more places in the work stream. Because traditionally there was just this one super expensive reference monitor at the end of the line. This is like the next extreme of that now you don’t even have to be in the studio anymore you can take it with you on the go and you can have that capability so from a from a creative pro standpoint we think this is going to be huge.”

In my use of the Pro Display and my conversations with professionals about it one of the the common themes that I’ve heard is the reduction in overall workload due to the multiple points in the flow where color and image can be managed accurately to spec now. The general system in place puts a reference monitor very late in the production stage which can often lead to expensive and time consuming re-rendering or new color passes. Adding the Liquid Retina XDR display into the mix at an extremely low price point means that a lot more plot points on the production line suddenly get a lot closer to the right curve.

One of the stronger answers on the ‘why the aggressive spec bump’ question comes later in our discussion but is worth mentioning in this context. The point Joswiak says is to offer headroom. Headroom for users and headroom for developers.

“One of the things that iPad Pro has done as John [Ternus] has talked about is push the envelope. And by pushing the envelope that has created this space for developers to come in and fill it. When we created the very first iPad Pro there was no Photoshop” Joswiak notes. “There was no creative apps that could immediately use it. But now there’s so many you can’t count. Because we created that capability we created that performance — and by the way sold a fairly massive number of them — which is a pretty good combination for developers to then come in and say I can take advantage of that. There’s enough customers here and there’s enough performance. I know how to use that. And that’s the same thing we do with each generation. We create more headroom to performance that developers will figure out how to use.

“The customer is in a great spot because they know they’re buying something that’s got some headroom and developers love it.”

The iPad Pro is now powered by the M1 chip — a move away from the A-series naming. And that processor part is identical (given similar memory configurations) to the one found in the iMac announced this week and MacBooks launched earlier this year.

“It’s the same part it’s M1” says Ternus. “iPad Pro has always had the best Apple silicon we make.”

“How crazy is it that you can take a chip that’s in a desktop and drop it into an iPad” says Joswiak. “I mean it’s just incredible to have that kind of performance at such amazing power efficiency. And then have all the technologies that come with it. To have the neural engine and ISP and Thunderbolt and all these amazing things that come with it it’s just miles beyond what anybody else is doing.”

As the M1 was rolling out and I began running my testing the power per watt aspects really became the story. That really is the big differentiator for M1. For decades laptop users have been accustomed to saving any heavy or intense workloads for the times when their machines were plugged in due to power consumption. M1 is in the process of resetting those expectations for desktop class processors. In fact Apple is offering not only the most powerful CPUs but also the most power-efficient CPUs on the market. And it’s doing it in a $700 Mac Mini a $1700 iMac and a $1100 iPad Pro at the same time. It’s a pretty ridiculous display of stunting but it’s also the product of more than a decade of work building its own architecture and silicon.

“Your battery life is defined by the capacity of your battery and the efficiency of your system right? So we’re always pushing really really hard on the system efficiency and obviously with M1 the team’s done a tremendous job with that. But the display as well. We designed a new mini LED for this display focusing on efficiency and on package size obviously to really to be able to make sure that it could fit into the iPad experience with the iPad experience’s good battery life.

“We weren’t going to compromise on that” says Ternus.

One of the marquee features of the new iPad Pro is its 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage. An auto-centering and cropping video feature designed to make FaceTime calling more human-centric literally. It finds humans in the frame and centers their faces keeping them in the frame even if they move standing and stretching or leaning to the side. It also includes additional people in the frame automatically if they enter the range of the new ultra-wide 12MP front-facing camera. And yes it also works with other apps like Zoom and Webex and there will be an API for it.

I’ve gotten to see it in action a bit more and I can say with surety that this will become an industry standard implementation of this kind of subject focusing. The crop mechanic is handled with taste taking on the characteristics of a smooth zoom pulled by a steady hand rather than an abrupt cut to a smaller closer framing. It really is like watching a TV show directed by an invisible machine learning engine.

“This is one of the examples of some of our favorite stuff to do because of the way it marries the hardware and software right” Ternus says. “So sure it’s the camera but it’s also the SOC and and the algorithms associated with detecting the person and panning and zooming. There’s the kind of the taste aspect right? Which is; how do we make something that feels good it doesn’t move too fast and doesn’t move too slow. That’s a lot of talented creative people coming together and trying to find the thing that makes it Apple like.”

It also goes a long way to masking the awkward horizontal camera placement when using the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. This has been a big drawback for using the iPad Pro as a portable video conferencing tool something we’ve all been doing a lot of lately. I ask Ternus whether Center Stage was designed to mitigate this placement.

“Well you can use iPad in any orientation right? So you’re going to have different experiences based on how you’re using it. But what’s amazing about this is that we can keep correcting the frame. What’s been really cool is that we’ve all been sitting around in these meetings all day long on video conferencing and it’s just nice to get up. This experience of just being able to stand up and kind of stretch and move around the room without walking away from the camera has been just absolutely game changing it’s really cool.”

It’s worth noting that several other video sharing devices like the Portal and some video software like Teams already offer cropping-type follow features but the user experience is everything when you’re shipping software like this to millions of people at once. It will be interesting to see how Center Stage stacks up agains the competition when we see it live.

With the ongoing chatter about how the iPad Pro and Mac are converging from a feature-set perspective I ask how they would you characterize an iPad Pro vs. a MacBook buyer? Joswiak is quick to respond to this one.

“This is my favorite question because you know you have one camp of people who believe that the iPad and the Mac are at war with one another right it’s one or the other to the death. And then you have others who are like no they’re bringing them together — they’re forcing them into one single platform and there’s a grand conspiracy here” he says.

“They are at opposite ends of a thought spectrum and the reality is that neither is correct. We pride ourselves in the fact that we work really really really hard to have the best products in the respective categories. The Mac is the best personal computer it just is. Customer satisfaction would indicate that is the case by a longshot.”

Joswiak points out that the whole PC category is growing which he says is nice to see. But he points out that Macs are way outgrowing PCs and doing ‘quite well’. He also notes that the iPad business is still outgrowing the tablets category (while still refusing to label the iPad a tablet).

“And it’s also the case that it’s not an ‘either or’. The majority of our Mac customers have an iPad. That’s an awesome thing. They don’t have it because they’re replacing their Mac it’s because they use the right tool at the right time.

What’s very cool about what [Ternus] and his team have done with iPad Pro is that they’ve created something where that’s still the case for creative professionals too — the hardest to please audience. They’ve given them a tool where they can be equally at home using the Mac for their professional making money with it kind of work and now they can pick up an iPad Pro — and they have been for multiple generations now and do things that again are part of how they make money part of their creative workflow flow” says Joswiak. “And that test is exciting. it isn’t one or the other both of them have a role for these people.”

Since converting over to an iPad Pro as my only portable computer I’ve been thinking a lot about the multimodal aspects of professional work. And clearly Apple has as well given its launch of a Pro Workflows team back in 2018. Workflows have changed massively over the last decade and obviously the iPhone and an iPad with their popularization of the direct manipulation paradigm have had everything to do with that. In the current world we’re in we’re way past ‘what is this new thing’ and we’re even way past ‘oh cool this feels normal’ and we’re well into ‘this feels vital it feels necessary.’

“Contrary to some people’s beliefs we’re never thinking about what we should not do on an iPad because we don’t want to encroach on Mac or vice versa” says Ternus. “Our focus is what is the best way? What is the best iPad we can make what are the best Macs we can make. Some people are going to work across both of them some people will kind of lean towards one because it better suits their needs and that’s that’s all good.”

If you follow along you’ll know that Apple studiously refuses to enter into the iPad vs. Mac debate — and in fact likes to place the iPad in a special place in the market that exists unchallenged. Joswiak often says that he doesn’t even like to say the word tablet.

“There’s iPads and tablets and tablets aren’t very good. iPads are great” Joswiak says. “We’re always pushing the boundaries with iPad Pro and that’s what you want leaders to do. Leaders are the ones that push the boundaries leaders are the ones that take this further than has ever been taken before and the XDR display is a great example of that. Who else would you expect to do that other than us. And then once you see it and once you use it you won’t wonder you’ll be glad we did.”

Apple's App Clips feature delivers just the right features of an app to you exactly when you need it quickly and securely. Here's what you need to know to use Apple App Clips on iOS 14 and up.

App Clips are not the same thing as the Apple-made app named Clips. It's confusing we know! Luckily we've got all the details on the not-related-to-App-Clips app named Clips.

What Is an iPhone App Clip?

App Clips are a feature of iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 and up. They deliver small pieces of functionality from an app to you when you need them without forcing you to download the entire app.

Apple Inc.

Think of it this way: Let's say you want to rent a scooter or bike from one of those roadside kiosks. With an App Clip you don't have to download the full app. Instead you just download a small part of the larger app which includes only the features you need right then (creating an account paying and unlocking the scooter or bike). With the App Clip you'll be done much faster and with less data used than with a normal app.

App Clips work on the iPhone iPod touch and iPad.

App Clips are essentially Apple's answer to Google Instant Apps which have been available on Android since 2018.

How Do I Get an iOS App Clip?

Apple Inc.

There will be a bunch of ways to get App Clips:

App Clip code: The image above shows Apple's new App Clip code. When you see one of these symbols in a store or at a location just scan it with your device's Camera app and you'll be prompted to install the App Clip linked to the code.

Safari and Messages: Websites in Safari can prompt you to download an App Clip. App Clips can also be shared via the Messages app.

How to Use Apple App Clips on iOS 14

When you're ready to use an App Clip here's what to do:

Find the prompt to us the App Clip on a website using a QR code via NFC or another means. Tap the Play or Open button (the button name is different based on the kind of App Clip it is). Depending on where the first button appeared you may need to tap the button in the pop-up from the bottom of the screen. In other cases the pop-up at the bottom of the screen is the first thing you see. Wait a few seconds for the App Clip to download and launch then start using it.

Will I Have a Ton of App Clips Cluttering up My iPhone or iPad?

No. First of all App Clips can only be a maximum of 10 MB. This ensures they'll download quickly (after all quick access to a feature is the main goal here) but also that they won't take up a lot of space on your device.

Even better the 10 MB App Clip is automatically deleted from your device 30 days after you download it (though you'll be able to manually delete App Clips the same way you delete apps too).

Lastly App Clips don't download to your home screen so they won't take up space there. All App Clips are automatically downloaded to your iPhone App Library.

Do I Need an Account to Use App Clips?

Most of the scenarios in which you'd use an App Clip would also require creating an account if you were using a full app. But if App Clips are supposed to be faster and easier than full apps how does creating an account work?

App Clips use Apple's Sign In With Apple feature which was introduced in iOS 13. This feature lets you create secure private one-off accounts with just one button tap. Sign In With Apple accounts are protected by Touch ID or Face ID so you'll just tap the account button authenticate yourself and your account will be up and running.

How Do I Make Payments With App Clips?

App Clips use Apple Pay for in-app payments. So you don't need to enter any new payment information or perform any additional payment verification steps to use App Clips. Just use Apple Pay like normal and the payment card on file in your Apple ID will be charged.

How Do I Find App Clips on My iPhone or iPad?

Apple Inc.

This is an Inside Science story.

Typical commercial white paints reflect only 80% to 90% of sunlight and fail to help buildings stay cool during the day. For the past six years mechanical engineer Xiulin Ruan at Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana and his colleagues sought to create whiter paints to cool buildings ""similar to an air conditioner but without the need of electricity"" he said. They explored more than 100 materials narrowing them down to 10 and testing roughly 50 different formulations of each material.

The one that performed best is based on barium sulfate a compound used to whiten photo paper and cosmetics. Its molecular structure can make it highly reflective to solar wavelengths of light. When it does absorb energy from heat or other sources it typically emanates it out at infrared wavelengths that zip unobstructed through air into outer space instead of heating its surroundings.

The scientists made sure the paint had a high concentration of barium sulfate particles of many different sizes. The wavelength of light each particle scatters depends on its size so a wide range of particle sizes helps the paint scatter more light from the sun.

The new paint reflects up to 98.1% of sunlight compared with the 95.5% of sunlight reflected by the researchers' previous ultra-white paint based on calcium carbonate. They suggest this white may be the equivalent of the blackest black ""Vantablack"" made using carbon nanotubes which absorbs up to 99.9% of visible light.

Outdoor tests of the new paint revealed it was the coolest on record keeping surfaces 19 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than their surrounding surfaces at night and 8 degrees cooler than surroundings under strong noon sunlight. It even worked in the middle of winter -- when the ambient temperature was 43 degrees F it still managed to lower temperatures by 18 degrees F. (This latter quality suggests this paint might work best for hot climates that would benefit most from cooling although Ruan noted they ""may come up with dynamic paints that can switch properties for other climates in the future."")

The scientists estimate that if 1000 square feet of roof were covered with this paint it would provide a cooling power of 10 kilowatts more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses. The scientists noted they could likely make the paint even whiter by increasing the particle concentration although too high a concentration would make the paint easier to peel off. Ruan noted that painting 0.5% to 1% of the Earth's surface with their paint for example by coating roofs roads unused land and so on might even help stop global warming.

Barium sulfate is common and environmentally safe and powders of it are roughly half the cost of the titanium dioxide powders often used in commercial white paints Ruan said. The scientists also noted the methods they used to make their paint are compatible with commercial paint fabrication techniques and can likely handle conventional outdoor conditions.

In the future the researchers want to optimize and commercialize their paint for a wide range of applications including buildings automobiles and outdoor equipment. They would also like to develop colored versions which won't achieve as much cooling but ""can still provide significant energy savings compared to commercial paints of the same color"" Ruan said.

The scientists detailed their findings online April 15 in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

But the goal is to pick stocks that do better than average. One such company is Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) which saw its share price increase 65% in the last year slightly above the market return of around 55% (not including dividends). The longer term returns have not been as good with the stock price only 29% higher than it was three years ago.

Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During the last year Archer-Daniels-Midland grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 29%. The share price gain of 65% certainly outpaced the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is now more optimistic about the stock.

The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings revenue and cash flow.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Archer-Daniels-Midland the TSR over the last year was 71% which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

It's good to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% in the last twelve months. Of course that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 12% per year) it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario this may hint at some real business momentum implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland you should be aware of.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

« Il y a des dates concrètes (...) je ne vais les citer mais c'est juin » a déclaré Iouri Ouchakov dans un entretien sur la chaîne de télévision publique Rossiya 1.

Après les expulsions croisées de diplomates la forte tension en Ukraine les divergences sur le sort de l’opposant Navalny le retour de l'ambassadeur américain en Russie John Sullivan aux États-Unis les relations entre Moscou et les pays occidentaux et plus précisément Washington semblent entrer dans une phase moins dure.

Un « oui sans doute » après avoir montré un intérêt imprécis c’est comme ça désormais que Moscou répond à l’offre américaine. Il y a 10 jours lors d’un échange téléphonique Joe Biden avait proposé à Vladimir Poutine une rencontre. Cette fois c’est un conseiller du Kremlin qui le dit : des dates concrètes sont à l’étude et ce serait pour le mois de juin. Sommet du G7 et de l’Otan réunion avec des dirigeants européens le premier déplacement à l’étranger du nouveau président des États-Unis s’étoffe.

Après le Royaume-Uni et la Belgique Joe Biden pourrait se rendre en Finlande ou en Autriche ces deux pays se sont portés candidats pour accueillir la rencontre au sommet russo-américaine.

Une rencontre pour stabiliser les relations entre les deux puissances. Le premier signe vers une éclaircie est cette annonce de Moscou : le départ des soldats russes massés à la frontière ukrainienne 100 000 selon l’Union européenne qui achèveraient leur retrait le 1er mai. Un retour qui demande encore à être vérifié sur le terrain.

Méta yachts file toutes voiles dehors

Philippe Brabetz est un homme de défis de plusieurs vies. Jeune champion de descente en eau vive le « Titi parisien » a fabriqué des kayaks et des hydrospeeds. Devenu architecte il a conçu des bâtiments de béton puis des décors et des effets spéciaux pendant près de dix ans pour Les Guignols de l'Info sur Canal + avant de décrocher le très recherché Diplôme d'architecture navale de Nantes et de s'arrimer à sa vraie passion les bâtiments de surface.

Il travaillera sur le Défi Areva pour l'America's Cup dans des chantiers navals au Maroc en Espagne et en France développera ses propres brevets comme le turbo keels® quille balastable assurant la stabilité des voiliers monocoques. Un brevet que Philippe Brabetz veut exploiter et qui fera du rachat de Méta « une évidence ». Une évidence toutefois vite percutée par le Covid.

Nos bateaux s'adressent à une clientèle qui n'a pas été impactée par la crise Philippe Brabetz (Dirigeant de Méta Yachts)

« J'ai signé le 12 mars 2020. Le dimanche 15 j'arrivais à Tarare. Le lundi 16 je mettais tout le monde au chômage partiel. » La production ne sera interrompue que trois semaines. « On a trois bateaux touristiques pour le Lac Léman qui sont en stand-by mais pour le reste nous n'avons pas été trop perturbés au niveau du travail ou du carnet de commandes explique M. Brabetz. Il y a une envie d'évasion qui se confirme. Nos bateaux s'adressent à une clientèle de dirigeants de société de cadres supérieurs de CSP + qui n'a pas été impactée par la crise sanitaire. La crise leur a même servis à mûrir leur projet à se décider à vendre leur entreprise à prendre leur retraite et à partir en bateau. »

Le Strongall® cet aluminium ultra-résistant mis au point par Joseph Fricaud le fondateur de Méta qui a fait la renommée internationale des coques sortant de l'atelier bordant la RN7 à la sortie est de Tarare reste un argument de vente incomparable pour sa durabilité.

« C'est plus écolo que les bateaux en fibre que l'on ne sait pas trop comment recycler explique Philippe Brabetz. Les bateaux conçus par Méta ne sont pas jetables ils sont transmissibles. » La transmission de l'entreprise qui a construit les Joshua de Bernard Moitessier Damien du chanteur Antoine Fleur australe de Philippe Poupon Nouveau monde de José Bové s'est bien passée. Patrice Passinge qui l'avait rachetée en 2005 à M. Fricaud dont il était le chef d'atelier a assuré la transition. Il n'est pas parti bien loin puisqu'il a investi un atelier voisin pour y aménager et y commercialiser le Méta 36' un voilier de 11 mètres « son bébé » dixit Philippe Brabetz.

Le Méta 50'

en figure de proue

La construction sera assurée par Méta Yachts le nouveau nom commercial du chantier naval qui a résolument aiguisé son sabre d'abordage marketing. Nouveau site internet nouvelle présence sur les plateformes de vente sur les salons virtuels nouveaux modèles « le téléphone sonne des mails arrivent on a des demandes » se réjouit le nouveau capitaine qui table sur un chiffre d'affaires « d'un à deux millions d'euros pour 2021 ».

Nouvelle figure de proue le Méta 50' un voilier familial de 15 mètres renouant avec la tradition de grand voyage du chantier tararien le premier signé Philippe Brabetz et Romain Acquaviva jeune architecte naval lui aussi diplômé de l'école nantaise embauché en janvier. Le Méta 50' sera commercialisé entre 700.000 et 900.000 euros selon les aménagements. Méta a aussi développé le Noé un bateau-logement fluvio-maritime de 24 mètres disposant d'une vaste serre de permaculture pour un médecin clermontois qui voudrait désormais le produire en série des coches solaires catamarans d'habitation entièrement autonomes énergétiquement qui seront posés sur le Lot ou le canal du Midi.

Côté énergies fossiles Méta a sorti aussi de ses logiciels CAO des bateaux de pêche au gros pour les Caraïbes des vedettes de sport pour le marché US et travaille avec un investisseur lyonnais à la création d'une gamme de bateaux de luxe néo-rétros inspirés du Riva pour le marché azuréen.

Pour tous ces projets avec la volonté d'intégrer l'aménagement des bateaux jusque-là sous-traité un effectif (10 personnes actuellement) qui est appelé à s'étoffer avec le recrutement rapide de quatre chaudronniers supplémentaires Méta cherche à trouver de nouveaux locaux. « Pas forcément à Tarare mais en tout cas dans la région lyonnaise indique Philippe Brabetz.

L’instit’ devenu chaudronnier

L'avantage de la région c'est que nous sommes au centre de l'Europe que c'est un bassin de compétences très riche et que les loyers et la main-d'œuvre y sont à un coût plus raisonnable que sur la Côte d'Azur ou la côte Atlantique. »

Au Sénégal les autorités annoncent avoir démantelé un trafic de faux médicaments début avril.

Selon l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) 42% de tous les faux médicaments qui lui ont été signalés entre 2013 et 2017 provenaient d'Afrique.

Le trafic de produits pharmaceutiques contrefaits représente jusqu'à 200 milliards de dollars US par an selon les estimations des Nations unies.

Mais face à cette prolifération de faux médicaments qui constitue un véritable problème de santé publique comment reconnaître un faux médicament ? Voici quelques conseils.

Comment reconnaître un faux médicaments ?

Crédit photo Getty Images Légende image Des séances d'incinérations des faux médicaments sont souvent organisées.

Voici les conseils de l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) pour identifier un produit médical de qualité inférieure ou falsifiée.

Certains produits médicaux falsifiés sont presque visuellement identiques au produit authentique et sont très difficiles à détecter. Cependant beaucoup peuvent être identifiés en examinant l'emballage pour vérifier l'état les fautes d'orthographe ou les erreurs grammaticales.

L'OMS conseille aussi de vérifier les dates de fabrication et de péremption en s'assurant que les détails figurant sur l'emballage extérieur correspondent aux dates indiquées sur l'emballage intérieur.

Il faut également vérifier que le médicament a une apparence correcte qu'il n'est pas décoloré dégradé ou qu'il a une odeur inhabituelle.

Qu'est-ce qu'un faux médicament ?

Crédit photo AFP Légende image 42% de tous les faux médicaments qui lui ont été signalés entre 2013 et 2017 provenaient d'Afrique.

Serigne Omar Sarr professeur agrégé de pharmacie à l'université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar définit un faux médicament comme « celui qui ne respecte pas les bonnes pratiques de fabrication et qui ne répond pas aux normes de qualité d'un médicament ».

« C'est un médicament qui circule sans aucune autorisation et qu'on peut retrouver dans le circuit illicite et qui est présenté de manière frauduleuse et délibérée en vue de tromper sur son identité et ou sa source » déclare-t-il dans un entretien avec BBC Afrique.

Selon l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) le faux médicament est une imitation.

«Un médicament contrefait est un médicament qui est délibérément et frauduleusement muni d'une étiquette n'indiquant pas son identité et/ou sa source véritable. Il peut s'agir d'une spécialité ou d'un produit générique et parmi les produits contrefaits il en est qui contiennent les bons ingrédients ou de mauvais ingrédients ou bien encore pas de principe actif et il en est d'autres où le principe actif est en quantité insuffisante ou dont le conditionnement a été falsifié» indique l'OMS.

Momar Ndao président de l'Association des consommateurs sénégalais (Ascosen) ajoute qu'il s'agit de médicaments « qui sont faits en ne remplissant pas les normes ».

« Il y a comprimé sous-dosés qui sont sur le marché des comprimés non-dosés sans principe actif dedans (des placebos) des comprimés surdosés. Tout cela ce sont des médicaments non conformes. Cela crée des problèmes de santé extraordinairement importants. » explique-t-il à BBC Afrique.

Quels sont les effets néfastes des faux médicaments ?

Crédit photo AFP Légende image Les faux médicaments sont responsables de nombreuses complications chez ceux qui les utilisent

Une analyse de la London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pour l'OMS estime que les médicaments antipaludiques de qualité inférieure et les faux médicaments pourraient causer 116.000 décès supplémentaires dus à la maladie chaque année en Afrique subsaharienne pour un coût moyen de 385 millions de dollars par an pour les patients et les systèmes de santé.

Et en 2015 une étude publiée dans l'American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene a estimé que plus de 122.000 enfants de moins de cinq ans meurent chaque année à cause de médicaments antipaludiques de qualité inférieure en Afrique subsaharienne.

Bien que ces résultats ne soient que des estimations les scientifiques suggèrent que les médicaments de mauvaise qualité contribuent de manière importante aux taux de mortalité des enfants de moins de cinq ans.

Pourquoi est-il difficile de lutter contre les faux médicaments ?

Les faux médicaments sont souvent impossibles à distinguer des vrais produits l'emballage étant aussi bon sinon meilleur que l'original.

La faiblesse ou l'incohérence des cadres juridiques et l'absence de réglementation pour réglementer les ventes souvent effectuées en ligne ou dans des lieux informels rendent compliqué la lutte contre ce fléau selon l'ONU..

Le coût des médicaments dans les pays pauvres pose également un problème.

""Si un médicament de bonne qualité provenant d'un fournisseur connu est trop cher les gens peuvent essayer un médicament moins cher provenant d'un fournisseur non agréé"" explique l'OMS.

Are We Not Aroused?,"Watching the red carpet at Monday night’s Met Gala I couldn’t help but recall a prediction I’d heard from Emily Kirkpatrick who writes the Substack newsletter “I <3 Mess.” She’d told me recently that before the end of 2024 it’s possible that “someone is going to show up fully nude on a red carpet.”

That didn’t happen at this year’s gala but it got very close as Doja Cat — who appeared earlier this year at the Grammy Awards in what was called “the most naked dress ever” — presented at the Met Gala in a long clinging soaking wet transparent and entirely revealing white T-shirt by the label Vetements.

Near-nudity is everywhere at least on celebrities and the celebrity adjacent. Bianca Censori Kanye West’s 29 year-old partner wandered around Paris wearing a cropped jacket with sheer pantyhose and seemingly nothing on underneath her modesty preserved only by the stockings’ single center seam. Julia Fox attended a fashion launch with three silver medallions covering her private parts under a long — and frequently parted — trench coat.

Should you get one?,"CNN —

An influential group of medical experts the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended last week that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue to get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74 the task force said.

This is a marked difference from the task force’s previous guidance which was to start biennial mammograms by age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health care provider but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50.

I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer?

To help us with these questions I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

People should now starting getting mammograms at age 40 according to new recommendations. yacobchuk/iStockphoto/Getty Images

CNN: How common is breast cancer?

Dr. Leana Wen: In the United States breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About 42000 women die every year from this cancer.

It’s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening by definition is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage before it has spread when there is the best chance for successful treatment.

CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes?

Wen: In recent years there has been a disturbing trend of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer.

In fact breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women.

This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100000 person-years compared to 15 per 100000 person-years among White women according to a 2023 JAMA Network Open study.

According to a study in the journal Lancet Oncology the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier at age 40.

The US Preventive Task Force’s change now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for instance recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The American Cancer Society gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.)

CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?

Wen: I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40.

This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations.

The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings.

CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives?

Wen: The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers.

Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer.

CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram?

Wen: A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don’t need to remove your underwear pants or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts.

The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram.

CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed?

Wen: Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound breast MRI or both.

I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses.

The American College of Radiology for example recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur.

CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer?

Wen: The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This once again is an issue to be discussed with one’s individual provider who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient’s wishes.

CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk?

Wen: Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that exercise can lower cancer risk in general as well as eating more whole foods and less ultraprocessed substances.

Women should also seek care if they develop any concerning symptoms such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit redness or flaky skin on the breast nipple discharge other than breast milk or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.

But on board the 12-year-old girl quaked with fear.

The captain and crew who she says had tortured her and three other women and girls were not finished. And the punishment for disobedience the men warned would be death.

It was the third night that the girl and around 140 other ethnic Rohingya refugees had been trapped on the wooden fishing boat floating off the coast of Indonesia. These children women and men had fled Bangladesh and their homeland of Myanmar in a bid to escape violence and terror only to face the same horrors with a crew that seemed to delight in their dread.

Huddled among the other women and girls the 12-year-old — identified in this story only by the initial N because she is a sexual assault survivor — tried to hide her face. She had already survived a night in the captain’s bedroom where she says he and several crew members had beaten and sexually abused her.

Like most of the passengers she had survived attacks by Myanmar’s military that forced her and her family to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. There she had survived nearly seven years in violence-plagued refugee camps. And she had thus far survived this journey without her family who hoped she’d make it to Malaysia where she was promised as a child bride to a man she had never met.

Her young life had been one long battle to survive. And so it seemed this night would be no different.

The captain was in a rage. He ordered more girls to join him and his crew in the bedroom.

No one budged.

“If you don’t come to us” the captain shouted “then we will capsize this boat!”

What happened next would force N and the other Rohingya on board into yet another battle for survival.

For many this would be the battle they finally lost.

____

In March Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from atop the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia’s northern province of Aceh. Another 67 passengers including at least 28 children had been killed when the boat capsized according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Until now little was known about how the boat capsized or why. This account as told to The Associated Press in separate interviews with eight surviving passengers provides the first insight into what happened on board and why so many died. The men women and children interviewed include witnesses of the events leading to the capsize and of the sexual abuse as well as the only surviving sexual assault victim N.

The disaster is the latest in a string of tragedies to befall the Rohingya a stateless Muslim minority that suffered mass slaughter at the hands of Myanmar’s military in 2017 in what the United States has dubbed a genocide. Over the past two years the Rohingya have increasingly fled Bangladesh's refugee camps where gang violence and hunger has surged and Myanmar where a bloody conflict between the ruling military junta and ethnic rebel groups has escalated. Muslim-majority Malaysia which the Rohingya view as relatively safe is the preferred destination.

The results of this mass exodus have been catastrophic. Last year 4500 Rohingya — two-thirds of them women and children — fled Myanmar and Bangladesh by boat the UNHCR reported. Of those 569 died or went missing while crossing the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea the highest annual death toll since 2014.

International indifference toward the Rohingya has in many ways worsened the crisis. In several cases coastal countries in Asia have ignored pleas to rescue imperiled Rohingya boats despite international laws mandating the rescue of boats in distress. Global donations for the nearly 1 million Rohingya languishing in overcrowded camps have plummeted leading to slashed food rations. And no country is offering large-scale resettlement.

Most Rohingya understand the risks of taking to the sea. But those who board the vessels say the world has left them with little choice.

And so it was that N arrived one night in March at a remote beach in southern Bangladesh where she climbed into a small fishing boat that would take her away from everything she knew including her family.

Like an increasing number of underage Rohingya girls she had been promised as a wife to a man in Malaysia she’d spoken to only by phone. These marriages are rooted in desperation: Many parents in the camps can no longer feed their children or afford the traditional dowry demanded by grooms. The men in Malaysia forfeit dowries and often send money to the brides’ parents.

The fishing boat ferried N and her fellow passengers to a larger boat which took them deeper into the Bay of Bengal. One day later they were moved again to an even bigger boat with a crew from Myanmar.

For around a week they slid seamlessly through the sea. The crew was kind providing enough food and water. The children had space to play. The waves were placid. For Rahena Begum traveling with her 9-year-old daughter and 12- and 13-year-old sons it almost felt too easy.

Until suddenly it wasn’t.

The captain told those on board the plan had changed. They would need to transfer everyone to an Indonesian fishing boat with a crew who would take them the rest of the way to Indonesia. From there the passengers would be smuggled into neighboring Malaysia. Though the captain gave no reason for the switch the recent surge in Rohingya arrivals has put Indonesian authorities on alert for boats from Bangladesh and Myanmar.

The sight of the rickety Indonesian vessel sent a chill through the passengers. Muhammed Amin who had fished the waters off Bangladesh for years and spent countless hours on boats estimated the Indonesian vessel was built to accommodate at most 60 people — not 140.

But the Myanmar captain and crew he says reassured him the boat was safe and that it would reach Indonesia in one day.

Reluctantly Amin N Rahena and the others climbed into the Indonesian vessel. The Myanmar boat soon disappeared into the distance.

____

Almost immediately the Indonesian captain and crew separated the men from the women.

The men were forced into the boat’s cramped stifling cargo holds one of which was beneath the captain’s bedroom. Anyone who protested was beaten Amin says.

The captain and crew turned to the women and girls but they did not speak Indonesian and could not understand their demands.

A few Rohingya men who spoke the language were allowed out of the hold to translate. When the women understood what the captain wanted they began to cry.

The men told the crew to leave the women alone. The crew beat them and then beat the women.

Seventeen-year-old Samira whose husband was stuck in the hold became an early target. The captain and crew repeatedly ordered her into the bedroom. A relative of Samira’s Fatima Khatun told the tearful teen to say she was sick and used hand signals to explain to the captain that Samira was married. The crew moved on.

N however had no one to protect her. And she quickly caught the captain’s attention.

She was a child stuck in the middle of the ocean facing a group of men who warned they were armed though no one ever saw a gun.

She had no choice.

And so N and four other women and girls entered the bedroom.

It wasn’t long before the stillness of the night was shattered by their screams.

____

Through her terror N struggled to make sense of what was happening then struggled to make it stop. But inside the room there was no pity only pain.

One of the women managed to slip out but N and the others were trapped. Two of the girls were teenagers and the third around 20 N estimated. All were in tears.

The abuse by the captain and five of his six crew members lasted all night N says. Attempts to fight back were met with beatings.

From the cargo hold below the bedroom the men could hear the cries. Those who dared to climb onto the deck could see the abuse unfolding through the room’s windows. But believing the crew was armed they say they were powerless to stop them.

When morning finally dawned N spotted a man she knew and signaled to him for help. He approached the room and was beaten by the crew but persuaded the captain to let N out to use the toilet. She hid among the other women and hoped the captain was finished with her.

He was at least for the moment. But he and the crew were not done with the other three girls whose assaults continued for a second night.

In the sweltering hold 19-year-old Jannat Ullah’s yearning for fresh air grew so intense he risked climbing on deck. When he emerged he says he looked through the bedroom window and saw the captain raping one of the teens. A crew member spotted Jannat and slapped his head until he retreated. But later Jannat says he watched through a gap in the wall as another crew member raped the same girl.

The sun was rising again along with the passengers’ desperation. The crew had given them no water and only tiny portions of rice noodles and eggs. They wondered how much longer they could last.

Fatima Khatun sitting next to the captain’s room with her 8-year-old daughter Ruma had witnessed the abuse of the girls inside and could bear no more. She signaled through the window to the girls to come out.

At last that night they did emerging sobbing and speechless. Fatima and Samira told them to cover themselves with hijabs and tried to hide them.

It was then that the captain and crew began demanding fresh victims.

The women and girls refused. The crew kicked and punched them. The women wept but stood their ground.

The captain and crew had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana the passengers told the AP. The captain was growing angrier.

“If you don’t come into the room I will capsize this boat!” he thundered again and again.

Samira told herself he must be joking.

____

It was around 9 p.m. and many of the children had fallen asleep oblivious to the chaos. As Fatima fretted over the captain’s threats daughter Ruma slumbered against her arm.

Fed up with the hold Amin and Jannat had come up on deck. The captain Amin says looked drunk his body wobbly. The captain went to the toilet and then headed to the helm.

Which is when Jannat says he saw the captain push the steering wheel with his leg.

The vessel tilted violently sending passengers tumbling. And then it smashed into a wave.

___

In the blackness of the water people screamed for salvation for God for their children.

“RUMA!” Fatima cried searching wildly for her daughter who had been ripped away when the boat overturned. “RUMA!”

Fatima fought to stay afloat but the water was swallowing her as fast as she was swallowing the water.

Suddenly hands closed around her arm and yanked upwards. Passengers who had climbed on top of the overturned hull were pulling her to safety.

She screamed and screamed for her little girl. But Ruma was gone.

Jannat could hear his 7-year-old cousin Futika shouting from somewhere inside the boat. Frantic the teen swam back into the vessel and spotted Futika wedged with others inside the cargo hold. Jannat tried to yank him free again and again. But it was futile. Jannat swam out clambered onto the hull and wept.

Those who were drowning desperately clutched at others struggling in a sea that was fast becoming a graveyard. Among the dying were mothers and fathers sisters and brothers a 3-year-old boy and his parents.

Scores of passengers found themselves trapped under heavy fishing nets that ensnared them when the boat overturned. Women wailed for help that did not come.

N battled her way through the throngs until she made it onto the hull. Once again she had managed to survive.

But the three girls who were abused alongside her in the captain’s bedroom had not their battered bodies disappearing into the depths.

In the water Rahena Begum spotted her 9-year-old daughter Rema but her two sons were nowhere to be seen. Other passengers pushed Rahena and Rema onto the hull then began to pump the unresponsive child’s chest and water-swollen stomach. Suddenly Rema’s hand moved and she sputtered a few words.

Rahena pulled her daughter into her lap and cuddled her. Her baby was alive at least for now. So was her 13-year-old son who’d also made it onto the hull. But her 12-year-old boy Noor Aziz was missing. She would never see him again.

Amin knew they had to keep the vessel stable if they had any hope of surviving. He ordered the men to stand on the corners of the hull to try to balance the weight.

The crew meanwhile wanted to be anywhere but the boat. Amin spotted the captain and three crew members swimming away using water jugs as flotation devices. The remaining three crew tried to follow them but Amin and the other men held them back forcing them to stay on the hull. Amin feared that if rescuers found them on the boat without a crew the passengers would be blamed for the disaster.

Hours passed and those on the hull waited for a miracle. In the morning it seemed to arrive in the form of another fishing boat. Scores of passengers leaped into the water and swam toward it. But the fishing boat was tiny and could not hold them all. The crew allowed six people on board then headed for shore.

The waves had worsened and passengers’ frantic attempts to flee the overturned boat had left the vessel unstable. It capsized again.

Rahena found herself back in the water fighting once more to save her daughter. She spotted Rema slipping below the surface and grabbed her before other passengers pushed the pair back onto the hull.

But Rema had grown delirious. She tried to bite people and could not speak. Rahena knew her daughter was in urgent need of help.

Others never made it back on board. Samira’s husband Akram Ullah estimates at least 20 drowned when the boat overturned the second time.

The subsequent capsize had knocked loose the remains of passengers who had drowned inside the vessel the night before. Jannat spotted the lifeless body of his little cousin Futika bobbing in the waves.

More fishing boats arrived and passengers called out for help. But those on board the vessels simply shot photos and videos of them then left.

A few passengers tried to swim to shore promising to send help if they made it. They were never seen again. And help still did not come.

But at least the rain did.

The passengers weak with thirst collected what they could in a tarp and shared sips of it thanking Allah for sparing their lives.

Yet as another night passed it was clear not everyone would be spared. Rahena’s daughter cradled in her lap had gone still. Rahena hugged her little girl and tried to talk to her. But the life had drained from her daughter.

The passengers prayed for the child then slid her body into the sea.

Around 30 minutes later Rahena says the rescue ship finally arrived.

____

In the days following the disaster the bodies of 12 women and three children were recovered from the waters off Aceh according to the UNHCR. The search for more has been called off.

Although the fishing boat’s crew rescued the initial six people from the hull the morning of March 20 search and rescue vessels were not launched until later that evening. Officials finally spotted the boat around 9 a.m. March 21 about 22 kilometers (14 miles) offshore and finished evacuating all the passengers from the hull around midday.

Ibnu Harris Al Hussain chief of Banda Aceh’s search and rescue agency said the rescue operation began shortly after his agency learned about the capsized boat. He also said officials needed time to coordinate a plan to care for survivors once they reached land while crews at sea initially kept their distance out of fear the passengers would hurt themselves trying to swim to the rescue boat.

“The most important thing is that we have ensured their safety when they were found” Hussain wrote to the AP.

On April 2 police announced they had arrested three members of the crew plus a fourth man who was not on board the boat. They were charged with people smuggling which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Police are still searching for the remaining crew including the captain whose mobile phone activity places him in Malaysia West Aceh Police Chief Andi Kirana told the AP.

Police are not considering murder charges Kirana says because they believe the capsize was an accident — the result of an overcrowded boat simply taking on too much water.

But N and the other passengers believe the disaster was a deliberate act of revenge by a sadistic captain and crew who thought they could escape. And for that — and for all the suffering endured — the punishment N says should fit the crime.

“They tortured us. They treated us like animals” she says. “We want the government to treat them like animals.”

Kirana also said police are not considering rape charges because they haven’t received any reports of sexual assault. But N says police have never questioned her about what happened on board.

For now she and the other passengers remain in limbo sleeping under tents behind a government office building. They have been shifted between shelters amid protests by locals who want them to go away. But there is nowhere for them to go.

Though they have survived so much some wonder what it was all for.

Rahena questions why she was spared when two of her children were not. Her husband already in Malaysia blames her for attempting the journey and for the death of their daughter and son.

“I lost my hope when I lost my children” Rahena says. “I feel like I have nothing.”

N alone and aching for her mother hopes to somehow make it to Malaysia and to the man who wants her as his wife.

Maybe then she says she will finally be free — though in reality Rohingya child brides in Malaysia often become prisoners to abusive husbands.

For now all she can do is fight to survive another day and pray for a future free of pain.

“I don’t want to suffer anymore” she says.

Stone masonry and other traditional crafts will take center stage over the next three years but digital models of the edifice before and after the fire will guide progress.

Enough data to create a digital twin of the cathedral building was already on the servers of the locally based survey company Art Graphique & Patrimoine (AGP) before the April 15 2019 fire. To capture the damaged building's geometry an AGP team completed another survey four days later.

The fire started in the cathedral’s roof consuming 1000-year-old oak beams toppling its 19th century spire and pouring tons of molten roofing lead onto internal stonework vaults. The cause of the fire has still not been determined. Rescue work started the next day and French President Emmanuel Macron promptly set a five-year deadline for the cathedral’s restoration.

Reaction from U.S. software company Autodesk Inc. was just as rapid. As news of the fire spread Nicolas Mangon vice president for architecture engineering and construction design got a call from company President and CEO Andrew Anagnost instructing him to offer Autodesk resources to the cathedral team.

Mangon a French citizen entered the charred building about two weeks after the fire and Autodesk began work on the BIM model a few weeks later. The company is providing models and support resources for the five-year restoration at no cost to the French authorities he says.

To achieve his rapid restoration schedule Macron ""had to create a public body [to go] faster than the traditional design bid build contract that takes place in France” says Mangon. Several months later the restoration program was put into the hands of the newly created public body (EPRNDP) led by Army General Jean-Louis Georgelin who reports to Macron.

In the months it took EPRNDP to move into action “we already started to build a 3D BIM model of the cathedral” says Mangon. Autodesk recruited AGP to provide the billions of coordinates in the point cloud representing the cathedral geometry with the survey firm having accumulated precise data of the cathedral over many years working for the ministry of culture’s regional department which owns the building.

The post-fire survey “was to see if there had been movement in the structure” says AGP business development manager Chiara Christarella. Using laser scanners and drone-based photogrammetry the team completed the survey in one day generating more than 30 billion data points in a “commando” operation that would normally have taken a week according to AGP.

“It was really in a rush” says Caitlin Roclin an AGP architect and modeller. Building the BIM model for a stonework structure erected over a period of nearly two centuries starting more than 800 years ago was a challenge she says. AGP specializes in surveying historic buildings “but it’s the scale of Notre Dame that’s difficult” she adds.

Progress Made

Autodesk will continue supporting the restoration until its end not as a paid supplier but as a patron. Meanwhile on site the $200-million rescue phase has gone well despite the presence of lead potential structural instability and the pandemic according to EPRNDP.

By last November some 40000 twisted and partially melted scaffolding tubes previously erected around the spire had been cut away. The great organ with its 8000 pipes left the site by December.

To stabilize the cathedral structure external flying buttresses have been propped with timber arches while scaffolding up to 27 m tall is being erected inside the chancel transepts and nave to allow propping of the weakened stonework ceiling.

Meanwhile 1000 oak trees have been procured to rebuild the roof and after much debate the decision was made last summer to replicate the 19th century spire rather than erect a modern structure as had been controversially proposed.",,,,,,,,,

ADVERTISEMENT

The world’s biggest oilfield contractor joined rivals Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Co. this week in predicting expansion in overseas work and a more muted recovery in North America through the rest of 2021. Global oil demand should return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year if not sooner Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch told analysts on Friday.

“A new growth cycle has finally commenced” he said in a statement released on Friday. “There is an increasingly positive sentiment in the industry outlook as the recovery strengthens despite the lingering concerns regarding the Covid-19 crisis.”

The service sector that helps oil explorers detect and drill underground reserves is slowly returning to work after a global glut and pandemic-led lockdowns sapped energy demand triggering job cuts and bankruptcies across the industry. The big three contractors who this week posted better-than-expected first-quarter results are pivoting away from the once-booming North American shale patch and chasing work elsewhere instead.

Schlumberger said it expects an increase in U.S. onshore activity in the second quarter that will level off during the second half. But international activity is poised to continue ramping up through the end of this year and beyond.

Sales are expected to grow by mid-single digits this quarter while operating margins probably will expand by as much a percentage point Chief Financial Officer Stephane Biguet said during the call.

The shares which have climbed more than 50% in the past year rose 1.9% to $25.73 at 10:58 a.m. in New York.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Schlumberger’s sales of its North American completion and artificial-lift businesses increase its focus on overseas markets which may account for 80% of revenue in 2021. ... The balance sheet should support its reduced dividend payout though buybacks are unlikely until the pandemic subsides. -- Scott J. Levine and Justin Rothhaupt BI analysts Read the report here.

Le Peuch has cut tens of thousands of workers reshuffled the company’s business around the globe and sold off assets in North America in order to focus on overseas work. The service provider expects to generate about 80% of sales from international markets.

The company continues to work on a pair of asset sales including drilling rigs in the Middle East and a business in Canada that shares in the ownership of wells Le Peuch said.

The first-quarter results reflect Schlumberger’s shifting strategy with its lowest North American sales output since the start of the shale boom roughly a decade ago. While a seasonal drop in international revenue from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is typical Schlumberger said the 3% sequential drop during the quarter was its shallowest since 2008.

Meanwhile Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller told investors on Wednesday that early signs of an international recovery are already showing up in orders for tools.

“These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year” Miller said. “We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcmJuZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9kb250LXN0b3AtbWUtbm93LWhvdy1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWhhcy1jb250aW51ZWQtdG8tb3V0cGFjZS1jcnVkZS1zaW5jZS1jb3ZpZC1oaXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't Stop Me Now - How Natural Gas Production Has Continued to Outpace Crude Since COVID Hit,,,,,,,,,,

IPL 2021 RCB vs CSK Match Report: Jadeja's all-round heroics powers Chennai Super Kings to top of table

Meanwhile it was a memorable day for the Chennai-based IPL franchise as Ravindra Jadeja blasted an IPL record-equalling 37 runs in one over and then grabbed three big wickets in an outstanding all-round display as Chennai Super Kings crushed Royal Challengers Bangalore by 69 runs at Wankhede Stadium Mumbai.

Jadeja pummelled 62 off 28 balls and lifted CSK to 191 for four after skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni opted to bat in a top-of-the-table clash. Then with his slow left-arm spin bowling the star all-rounder picked up the important wickets of AB de Villiers and Glenn Maxwell to derail RCB's run-chase on a sluggish Wankhede pitch.

After a cracking start that saw them cross 50 in five overs RCB were stopped at 122 for nine in 20 overs. The immensely talented Devdutt Padikkal top-scored with a blazing 34 off just 15 balls.

Veteran South African leg-spinner Imran Tahir (2/16) picked up two wickets for CSK while giving away very few runs. Jadeja began the final over of CSK innings by clobbering four consecutive sixes off Harshal Patel before adding another off the fifth ball. He smashed the last ball over square leg for four as Harshal who had figures of 3 for 14 going into the final over finished with 4-0-51-3.

Jadeja batting at No.5 was yet to open his account when he was dropped by Dan Christian off Washington Sundar. With CSK placed at 154/4 when Harshal was handed the ball Jadeja hit the first four balls for towering sixes and followed them with another maximum and a boundary in the seven-ball final over.

RCB capitulated after the exit of skipper Virat Kohli (8) and Padikkal who provided a flying start by racing to 44 in three overs. Padikkal looked in sublime touch as he hit boundaries effortlessly sending two over the fence.

After Kohli fell to a slower ball from Sam Curran (1/35) and Padikkal was dismissed by Shardul Thakur (1/11) things went downhill for the Bengaluru team as it slipped to 81 for 5 in the 10th over.

Washington Sundar (7) who was promoted to the No.3 spot could not make an impact and was Jadeja's first victim. Glenn Maxwell (22 15 balls) threatened albeit briefly before being castled by Jadeja. De Villiers (4) on whom the team's hopes rested was foxed by Jadeja who got one to turn to dismiss the dangerous South African.",,,,,,,,,

Morgan Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are three of the banks who have taken the lead on using APIs for global banking

With companies expanding into new regions and doing more trade with the rest of the world than ever before global transaction banking has become critical to their success.

Traditionally major banks have provided these essential services covering everything from transfers payments and cash and asset management to financing and global trade.

It’s a money spinner that generates almost $1 trillion in global annual revenues and is expected to grow to $7.2 trillion in ten years according to industry estimates.

Previously banks had relied on legacy systems and technologies such as host-to-host file transfer to integrate their services with clients’ systems. However while working well for single-step transactions they struggle with more complicated real-time functionalities such as reconciliation trade services collections and supply chain finance.

In the face of increasing competition from more nimble rivals notably fintechs and digital banks banking institutions have had to up their game. Enter business-to-business (B2B) application programming interfaces (APIs) which enable banks to simplify transactions and provide clients with a seamless service.

Why use APIs in global banking?

But what are the key challenges involved in migrating to this new technology and how can banks overcome them? What has been the effect of regulation? And how can they capitalise on the biggest growth areas?

APIs work in closed networks that integrate banks’ services with their clients’ enterprise systems and workflows. They allow banks to scale complex operations and eliminate the need for brokers or service bureaus.

Banks including Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan and the Bank of America have already taken the lead. Yet as a technology it’s still in its relative infancy with a lack of clearly defined industry standards and is restricted by clunky infrastructure and governance protocols.

What are the drawbacks of APIs?

The biggest challenge is in developing a platform that is both user friendly and compatible with clients’ systems. Too many APIs however are let down by poor or overcomplicated designs due to lack of development expertise.

“API banking is a product with unique design constraints and challenges in the same way mobile or web banking are” says David Jarvis co-founder and chief executive of Griffin a banking-as-a-service provider. “You need to build out that expertise internally and none of the banks have invested in this to date.”

They also need to be fully secure well documented and meet ever-evolving regulatory changes. Then there is the considerable cost involved too as well as overhaul of existing systems and processes.

To overcome these issues banks must embrace technology and change with a dedicated team focused on developing a strategy and rigorously testing their APIs. They should also collaborate with clients and partners including fintechs thus spreading the cost of innovation and reducing time to market.

How to implement APIs properly

As an absolute basic first step banks need to invest in a digital banking platform that links their gateway and product processors and functions to enable their APIs. That platform informs all the modification authentication authorisation and consent-management capabilities as well as connecting multiple information sources.

Société Générale has achieved this by building its B2B SG Markets platform. It provides everything from cash management financing and security services to global markets and private banking.

“By implementing machine learning and combining our cash management and FX [foreign exchange] within our platform we have created a one-stop shop” says Société Générale’s head of execution platforms and UK chief digital officer Sohail Raja. “It enables clients to do everything from managing their transactions to taking cash positions on different currencies.”

Citi meanwhile has partnered with treasury software providers including FIS Kyriba Oracle and SAP to embed its API functionalities into their core products. This month its CitiConnect platform reached one billion calls from corporate clients since its launch in 2017 while API volume grew 60 per cent in 2020.

“APIs are great for real-time treasury services to enable our clients to have the most optimal digital banking experience” says Mayank Mishra managing director and global head of digital channels at Citi treasury and trade solutions. “Open banking is an extension of this but one that helps enable an entire market or industry vertical.”

UniCredit has also teamed up with FinDynamic to build its platform which allows clients to automatically view invoices through a web-based or mobile platform and approve invoices for payment. In September 2020 it launched the first open banking API with an IBAN check to enable clients to verify their customers’ account details.

Open banking innovation

The move to APIs is being fuelled by open banking regulations such as the European Union’s Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the introduction of the United Payments Interface in India. PSD2 has required banks to release their data in a secure standardised form so it can be readily shared between authorised parties online.

“Industry needs like smart personalisation and corporate banking are driving the conversation beyond banking directives now” says Vikram Gupta global vice president at Oracle Financial Services. “These capabilities need access to premium information beyond regulatory mandates that give banks an opportunity to tap into new revenue streams and provide better services to their customers as well maintain customer stickiness.”

How new tech is supporting global transaction banking

Simultaneously artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have vastly improved risk and liquidity analytics and forecasting within treasury management systems. Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have also driven the digitalisation of trade and supply chain finance.

“Banks need to accept that the future of finance is decentralised and integrate blockchain and AI into their overall digital transformation strategy” says Inpay’s head of financial institutions Stan Cole. “They can remain a central part of society by capitalising on the tremendous opportunities technology brings in terms of an incomparably higher speed and lower cost.”

The biggest growth areas over the next three years will be cash management and trade finance. More than 85 per cent of respondents to a McKinsey survey plan to invest in cash management APIs in the next three years and almost 50 per cent want to expand their trade finance APIs.

Banks can support this by upgrading their API capabilities to allow clients to initiate self-service transactions directly. They can also cater to clients in different time zones with real-time payment processing liquidity risk and fraud management cash-flow forecasting reporting and pricing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90aGUtZ3JlZW5pbmctb2YtdGhlLXMtcC01MDAtNy1jaGFydHMtZm9yLWVhcnRoLWRheS0xMTYxOTAyOTYwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvdGhlLWdyZWVuaW5nLW9mLXRoZS1zLXAtNTAwLTctY2hhcnRzLWZvci1lYXJ0aC1kYXktMTE2MTkwMjk2MDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 'greening' of the S&P 500: 7 charts for Earth Day,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-greening-of-the-s-p-500-7-charts-for-earth-day-11619029602 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90aGUtZ3JlZW5pbmctb2YtdGhlLXMtcC01MDAtNy1jaGFydHMtZm9yLWVhcnRoLWRheS0xMTYxOTAyOTYwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvdGhlLWdyZWVuaW5nLW9mLXRoZS1zLXAtNTAwLTctY2hhcnRzLWZvci1lYXJ0aC1kYXktMTE2MTkwMjk2MDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdidHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtdW5pb24tYW1lcmljYS1wcm9tb3Rlcy1oZWF0aGVyLWxhbWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit Union of America promotes Heather Lamb - GREAT BEND TRIBUNE,"Credit Union of America (CUA) promoted Heather Lamb to Real Estate Loan Officer.

An East Coast businessman lures in more than two dozen investors with promises of lucrative profits — when in reality those profits don’t exist and he’s using money from new investors to pay back previous ones.

But in this particular case his name isn’t Bernie Madoff. It’s Ian Bick.

By 2013 Bick was an 18-year-old event promoter with multiple businesses in Danbury Connecticut. On the outside they seemed to be the successful ventures of an entrepreneurial prodigy. But behind the scenes “it was a free-for-all s**tshow” Bick says in “Generation Hustle” HBO Max’s new anthology series about the young ambitious and fraudulent.

While Bick says he wasn’t trying to run a Ponzi scheme – “I looked at it as taking one loan to pay off another loan” Bick explains in the series – the feds disagreed. In 2016 Bick was convicted of defrauding his business investors of nearly $500000.

Whether on the smaller scale like Bick’s or superlatively large like Bernie Madoff’s this kind of financial fraud is unnervingly and increasingly common. Here’s a look at eight of the most notorious Ponzi schemes in US history:

1. Charles Ponzi – $15 million

Compared to today’s notorious cons the loss associated with this scam in 1920 might seem a pittance. But in the tale of Charles Ponzi it wasn’t just the size of the swindle but the speed with which it was done. According to Smithsonian Magazine Ponzi made an estimated $15 million in eight months by convincing lenders he could make them rich with investments in international postal reply coupons. His story was so infamous that the basics of the pyramid scheme – take money from a new investor to pay back an old one – began to carry his name despite the fact that he wasn’t the first to do it.

2. Lou Pearlman – $300 million

The man behind platinum-selling boy bands ‘NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys Lou Pearlman’s legacy also includes a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition to being sued by the very boy bands he created for stealing money Pearlman swindled investors and banks out of more than $300 million on the basis of companies that only existed on paper.

In 2008 he was convicted of conspiracy and money laundering charges and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. He died at the age of 62 in 2016.

3. Gerald Payne and Greater Ministries International – $448 million

In the 1990s Gerald Payne and leadership at his Greater Ministries International Church convinced nearly 20000 investors to hand over millions in a program that claimed it could “Double Your Blessings.” The IRS began to investigate based on suspicious bank activity and by 2001 Payne was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison. At the time the IRS called it one of the biggest Ponzi schemes it had ever investigated.

4. Reed Slatkin – $593 million

Known as a co-founder of EarthLink the internet service provider that launched in the mid-90s prosecutors say Reed Slatkin’s massive Ponzi scheme began long before the company existed. In 2003 the former Santa Barbara investment manager pleaded guilty to defrauding his investors of more than $500 million across 15 years starting in 1986.

5. Scott Rothstein – $1.2 billion

It isn’t always finance types who run the biggest scams: Scott Rothstein used his Fort Lauderdale law firm to run an eye-popping $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. According to the Miami Herald Rothstein convinced his investors to buy into bogus legal settlements. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 – a term that’s held despite his attempts at reduction.

6. Tom Petters – $3.7 billion

Businessman Tom Petters was accused of stealing money from hedge funds missionaries and pastors alike according to the New York Times. Petters promised investors that by pouring money into his organization they’d fund the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit. But that’s not what happened and in 2010 Petters was sentenced to 50 years in prison. The scam is reportedly the biggest in Minnesota history.

7. R. Allen Stanford – $7 billion

Texas tycoon R. Allen Stanford masterminded a 20-year scheme via his offshore bank in Antigua cheating almost 30000 investors from more than 100 countries out of billions. The scam involved fake certificates of deposit and prosecutors accused Stanford of funneling funds into his personal interests including real estate and cricket tournaments. In 2012 Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in federal lockup.

8. Bernie Madoff – $20 billion

It’s unclear at what point Bernie Madoff began shaping the largest Ponzi scheme in history; some believe it may have extended all the way back to the 1960s. Regardless of the timeframe what is known is that he conned thousands of investors out of $20 billion in principal funds. After his arrest in 2008 he was sentenced to 150 years in prison where he died on April 14 at the age of 82."

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

Other than a press release from Haven at the time of its disbanding only JPM CEO Jamie Dimon has publicly addressed the failed venture. But Warren Buffett watchers may wonder if the Berkshire CEO will discuss the breakup and the state of U.S. health care at the conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting on May 1 which will be streamed live exclusively on Yahoo Finance.

The joint venture was formed with the goal of improving the health care experience and lowering costs of care for their employees in January 2018. As large employers the trio saw firsthand how quickly the costs of health care were rising as employer-based health care remains one of the largest sources of health insurance coverage in the country.

So why did it fail? Largely the venture failed to take off because the U.S. health care system is just too complex to be disrupted experts have said. Haven also faced competition from entrenched players in the health care system and despite their size and reach the three companies had trouble obtaining necessary data that could help them better control costs the Wall Street Journal reported in January citing people familiar with the project's budget. Moreover the venture had unclear goals.

All told the failure of Haven was “not so much because employers or insurers had never tried to control costs. It was always unclear what new value-add Haven brought to the table"" according to Loren Adler an expert with the Brookings Institute.

Dimon in his annual letter to shareholders on April 7 noted that even though Haven disbanded JPM will ""continue to build on what we learned"" stating that the problems that existed when Haven formed in 2018 still exist.

""Our costs are more than twice those of the developed world without justification by better outcomes"" he said. ""We will invest in healthcare innovation and other approaches to improve the health and well-being of our employees and address this critical national issue. More details will be shared as we progress"" he added.

Stakes in different parts of the health care system

The trio also failed to get their venture off the ground because they had stakes in different parts of the health system and according to several reports were never able to align their goals.

Berkshire owns shares in several health care companies including big pharmaceuticals like Merck (MRK) Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) as well as dialysis giant DaVita (DVA).

Amazon expanded its interest in the mail-order pharmacy business with its acquisition of PillPack which it has now transformed into Amazon Pharmacy — with many anticipating an even greater expansion into pharmacy services soon. Its cloud service AWS is increasingly playing a role behind the scenes for all types of health entities including hospitals. The e-commerce giant has also launched clinics for its employees which could expand to the general population.

Meanwhile JPM maintains a significant presence in the industry ranging from its well-known annual health conference in San Francisco to the various services for health companies and research into health policies and issues.

Dr. Atul Gawande who led the joint venture until he left in the middle of last year told Yahoo Finance recently that there are some areas where the private sector can take the lead but — as the pandemic has shown — the U.S.'s weak public health sector needs attention to strengthen the industry overall.

Greater investment into public health is needed in order for the country to avoid being caught flat-footed again at the onset of what is likely to be another pandemic in the future he said.

""We're not committed as a country even now to making sure everyone has coverage everyone has a doctor and they're part of a system that can reach you. That's part of the difficulty that's made this so specifically difficult in the United States"" Gawande said.

Should investors be worried?,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

If this is a new Roaring Twenties for stocks and the economy do we need to worry about how the 1920s ended?

There has been a lot of talk about how the combination of massive economic stimulus and vaccines for Covid-19 could bring about a lengthy financial boom — just as there was during the 1920s after the end of the influenza pandemic.

But if you follow this analogy to its conclusion there could be a major cause for concern. After all the 1920s ended with the Black Tuesday stock market crash in October 1929 — right at the onset of the Great Depression.

“The Roaring Twenties were a great period of time for investors but they didn’t end well” said Randy Frederick vice president of trading and derivatives for Schwab Center for Financial Research.

Some experts worry that similar excesses could be building now in the stock market and economy. You see it with the rise of meme stocks like GameStop (GME) the surge in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the unrelenting runup in US housing prices.

Still that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s time to panic and start preparing for another significant upheaval.

“Another Great Depression scenario is hard to see” said Troy Gayeski co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge Capital.

Gayeski noted that many big businesses and consumers have stockpiled cash. The personal savings rate in the US is currently hovering just under 14% — compared to 7.6% in January 2020.

This cushion should prevent the economy from going into free fall even if there is more volatility in stocks.

“I don’t think a short-term hangover will lead to a multi-year downturn” Gayeski said.

Frederick agreed that investors are not worrying about a meltdown in part because stocks already took a massive hit last year due to the pandemic — and quickly recovered.

Wall Street is also hopeful that economic policymakers most notably Treasury Secretary (and former Federal Reserve chair) Janet Yellen and current Fed chair Jerome Powell will not do anything rash that risks jeopardizing the recovery of the economy or market.

“There is a lot of confidence in Yellen. She knows what she’s doing. And the Fed won’t raise rates aggressively” said Louis Navellier chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates.

That should keep the economy and financial markets humming along. Of course there will likely be corrections along the way. That’s only natural.

But Gayeski said it’s hard to imagine inflation roaring back in such dramatic fashion that it would lead the Fed which meets again on Wednesday to change course.

Absent that the Fed can stay on hold and investors won’t have to worry that the central bank will grind the economy to a halt with big rate hikes.

“Covid dealt such a massive body blow to the economy but there has been unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and the markets have responded to that. At some point the Fed may have to gradually let up on the accelerator. But not right now” he said.

The Oracle of … LA?

Warren Buffett’s “Woodstock for Capitalists” will be a virtual affair for the second straight year due to the pandemic.

Instead of tens of thousands of people flocking to Nebraska investors must settle for tuning into Yahoo Finance’s webcast of the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholder meeting on Saturday May 1.

And this year it will be a Hollywood affair. Buffett will be holding the meeting in Los Angeles — the hometown of Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger.

Expect Buffett (and Munger) to talk about the stock market comeback and top Berkshire holdings like Apple (AAPL) Bank of America (BAC) and the Oracle of Omaha’s beloved Coca-Cola (KO).

They also could discuss the rise of meme stocks and short-term investing the possibility of higher taxes on the wealthy and any updates on Berkshire Hathaway succession planning.

Buffett turns 91 in August. Munger is 97. Berkshire’s two other vice chairmen Ajit Jain and Greg Abel will also be on the webcast — and they are both expected to take on even more responsibility in the eventual post-Buffett era.

More than 10 years ago or almost 123 months in the past. And the verdict? ""The MP4-12C is no more and certainly no less than the most capable supercar on the planet right now."" Not bad for a first effort.

And look what McLaren Automotive has achieved since then. Tens of thousands of supercars sold motorsport success across the globe a host of technological innovations and a reputation as builder of some of the best driver's cars around. Which is pretty good going in a measly decade. Nobody will deny there have been problems - the current covid-induced downturn a particularly bad one - but by the same token those considerable achievements cannot be ignored either. And with cars like the Artura on the horizon the future looks rosy too.

For now though we're looking back. There is no better window into the past than the classifieds and while there are more similarities in the line-up than you might find elsewhere there are some crucial differences to consider as well; a 675LT is older and less powerful than a 720S so should you pay more for one? Should the same money be spent on a nearly new GT or 570S? And is a 650S really worth the premium over a 12C? The latter starts from less than £70k now don't forget...

These being bonafide supercars there's be no £10k bargain basement specials here. But there are cars that having led the class in recent years look even more compelling as secondhand buys. As with so many of these lists what hasn't benefitted the new customer has proved remarkably advantageous for the used buyers. Prepare to be tempted...



Up to £75000...

Were it not such a widely known fact the value on offer in a McLaren 12C would be scarcely believable. Here's a 10-year-old carbon tubbed 200mph supercar one with an engine also used in Longtail McLarens to great effect available for the price of a Cayman GTS. That's not some daft comparison of a mega-miles bit of exotica against a heavily optioned Porsche either. This 718 has almost 3000 miles is for sale at £75000; this 12C has almost 9000 miles and is £74900. It really is remarkable.

Of course there are reasons for the 12C's less than stellar residual performance. The launch wasn't trouble free with early quality issues and some reservations about the styling; made doubly worse by the fact that the 650S so effectively updated the fundamental package just a few years later.

On the other hand there's an awful lot here that's come to characterise what's so good about the modern McLaren experience: the lucid lovely hydraulic steering great visibility from a low scuttle and a spooky ability to combine a serene ride with laser guided handling thanks to the Pro Active Chassis Control. In a car cheaper than an M2 CS. This particular 12C has the 625hp upgrade and looks smart in black with tan; with just two owners since 2011 (many have had a lot more) it looks a fine way to begin a McLaren ownership story. And we're just getting started...

Up to £100000...

If the 12C and 650S strongly hinted at what McLaren could achieve against established supercar rivals the 570S ensured it was beyond all doubt: Woking could make 200mph dream cars as well as any other.

Lessons had learnt from those Super Series cars were obviously incorporated into the Sports Series: put simply it was a more exciting car both to look at and to drive than the early McLarens. The 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 found more of a voice the conventional suspension lent a more connected road feel and it felt just as searingly fast despite less power. Against 911 Turbos and Audi R8s the 570S presented a formidable alternative.

As such plenty of them sold. At the time of writing there are more than 50 Sports Series cars for sale on PH if the 540C GT and Longtail cars are included. With the earliest cars now five years old and the Sports Series effectively replaced by the Artura hybrid now seems as good a time as any for a 570S.

Once more the performance on offer for the price asked looks staggering. This 2017 car has the Track Pack - a £16k option new with lighter wheels and carbon seats - and has covered just 6000 miles in that time yet is on offer for £90k. Attention may inevitably be drawn away from the 570S as the new Artura comes on stream but if anything that only serves to make it a more attractive prospect - it's fantastic.

Up to £125000...

Perhaps the GT wasn't McLaren's most notable achievement. The logic was sound enough - the 570GT was well received so it made sense to broaden the scope - but ultimately the GT didn't quite hit the mark. The problem was the sacrifice made in the name of compromise: it was neither as sharp as a traditional supercar nor as accommodating as dedicated GTs - of which there are plenty to choose from.

Which isn't to say the GT was without merit. Because essentially this car is a more luxurious more capacious slightly less frenzied take on the modern McLaren. Maybe that's a small niche to be catering for but it doesn't make the product any less desirable. All GTs feature a 620hp version of the 4.0-litre V8 a Monocell II-T derivative of the monocoque for more space Proactive Damping Control and some additional sound deadening to help with longer journeys.

Launched at just over £160k it's now possible to pay £120k for a McLaren GT with a fairly nominal mileage. This one is on offer at £122490 from McLaren Glasgow registered last year and with only 4000 miles recorded. Perhaps the GT was an odd tangent to pursue but the car becomes a whole lot more tempting with that sort of saving.

Up to £150000...

In a world of £50k Golf Rs and £90k M3s the McLaren 720S might be the best value fast car out there. Even with early depreciation seemingly now levelled off a tad that a car of this immense desirability and performance can be bought for £135000 is staggering.

Moreover the 720S was arguably when McLaren Automotive really really came good. Launched in 2017 it brought together all that had been learnt from the past years - everything from Longtails to P1s and 12Cs to GTs - to create a phenomenal supercar. It looked sensational it was obscenely fast it drove beautifully and the interior was a significant improvement on what had preceded it. Even today with a 765LT out there and electric hypercars announced on a weekly basis the 720 will blow your mind. Which is exactly the point of a near hypercar isn't it?

The new price just snuck in under a quarter of a million but many cars will have been a lot nearer £300k given the number of extras available to customers. This Performance 720S is fairly modestly specced with the most notable options being the Elite paint finish and upgraded stereo and is for sale at £146950. Creep over the £150k budget and you can even buy McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt's old car...

Up to £200000...

If perhaps less impactful than the 675LT which had come before - because such a tremendously high bar had by then been established - then the 600LT remained a truly epic supercar. It might even have been a better drive than the old 675 arriving later and with the benefit of a few more years development.

The LT approach was identical for 600 as it has been for 675 because why mess with a winning formula? Weight was shed ruthlessly from throughout the car power was nudged ever so slightly up and the car was made ever so slightly longer to keep the name almost valid. In this instance it was 74mm with both front splitter and rear diffuser extended.

The resulting 600LT was as before too: a great supercar made into a simply tremendous one. The clarity of feedback urgency of response and ferociousness of performance put the 600 on another plane compared to the 570 and to most other supercars really. Today that precocious ability if available from less than £150k which means this budget opens up basically box fresh cars. This LT Clubsport has just 214 miles and is chock full of options with the Senna seats both Carbon Exterior Packs and the ultra-lightweight forged wheels.

Typically it's said that you can't have more fun for less when discussing a new car; here it might be true that you can't spend more and have a better experience. The LT really is that good.

Up to £250000...

For many the 675 LT is the pinnacle of McLaren Automotive's decade and it isn't hard to see why. By the launch of the Longtail in 2015 it was clear that McLaren could make some supremely capable supercars. What they lacked however was the intangible allure of the very best the elements that can't be quantified on a spreadsheet and that make you desperately yearn for a Ferrari or Lamborghini. It's sense of occasion for want of a better phrase. The 675LT wanted for almost nothing and a sense of occasion least of all.

Because unlike the McLarens that had come before (P1 notwithstanding) the Longtail didn't have to be driven fast to feel exciting. It was brimming with feel and feedback and excitement from the off; it wouldn't have mattered if the 675 was actually slower than a 650S because as an experience it was that much more memorable. Handily the extra power and 100kg weight saving ensured it was monumentally quick as well as endlessly rewarding to drive. Did we mention it looked extraordinary too?

The LT's almost peerless reputation its position as the car by which all future Woking products were to be judged has worked with limited numbers to ensure values have remained fairly buoyant. There were 500 coupes and 500 Spiders made of which this must be one of the lowest mileage out there: a Spider registered in 2016 but just 388 miles old. £219000 buys it and a lifetime of driving nirvana to boot. Sounds like a good deal to us.

Sky's the limit...

The McLaren P1 had a mighty task on its hands in 2013. Not only did it have to indirectly succeed the almighty F1 but it also had to announce the still very new McLaren Automotive into the realm of genuine hypercars having only produced the 12C up to that point. Oh yes and it had to do so with a hybrid powertrain at the same time as Porsche and Ferrari were doing exactly the same thing. Did it succeed? Take a guess...

The P1's numbers look if anything even more ridiculous all these years later. As the weight of hybrid systems continue to be pilloried so the P1's 1450kg kerbweight seems all the more impressive. Though ostensibly there to aid the twin-turbo V8 there was even some pure EV range in the P1 - it's not until almost a decade later that McLaren is doing it again. And frankly when every EV hypercar is set to be £2m or more its £866000 asking price back then looks positively reasonable.

You'll pay rather more than that today which says a lot about the esteem in which the P1 continues to be held. This UK-supplied car in Volcano Orange (as per the P1 at the 2012 Frankfurt show) first hit the road in 2015 and has covered 4000 miles since then. It's for sale at £1294990 exactly and will feel like money very wisely invested. And if it doesn't then how about a P1 GTR?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcGFydG1lbnR0aGVyYXB5LmNvbS90aGUtYmVzdC1wbGFjZXMtdG8tYnV5LXN0eWxpc2gtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtaG9tZS1kZWNvci1vbmxpbmUtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWludGVyaW9yLWRlc2lnbmVycy0zNjkwOTU4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Places to Buy Stylish Sustainable-Minded Home Decor Online According to Interior Designers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-best-places-to-buy-stylish-sustainable-home-decor-online-according-to-interior-designers-36909584 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcGFydG1lbnR0aGVyYXB5LmNvbS90aGUtYmVzdC1wbGFjZXMtdG8tYnV5LXN0eWxpc2gtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtaG9tZS1kZWNvci1vbmxpbmUtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWludGVyaW9yLWRlc2lnbmVycy0zNjkwOTU4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Bld3RhY3RpY2FsLmNvbS9iZXN0LW1yZS1icmFuZHMta2l0cy1zdXJ2aXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best MRE Brands & Kits [Taste Tested],ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pewpewtactical.com/best-mre-brands-kits-survival/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Bld3RhY3RpY2FsLmNvbS9iZXN0LW1yZS1icmFuZHMta2l0cy1zdXJ2aXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL3doZXJlLXRvLWJ1eS1hLXBzNS1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdS1nZXR0aW5nLXNvbnlzLW5ldy1jb25zb2xlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to buy a PS5: Everything you need to know about getting Sony's new console,"Well it's been more than five months and so many of the gamers seeking a PS5 are still trapped in a constant cycle of waiting for restocks logging on at the exact right moment and getting nothing more than a ""sold out"" message for their troubles. You'd think that demand for a gaming system that dropped last November would have waned by now but high demand exacerbated by low supply caused by a global chip shortage has continued to make it difficult for Sony to produce enough consoles for everyone who wants one.

But don't lose hope! Sony's PlayStation Direct has been holding brief restock events almost weekly and those who continue to queue up for a PS5 might also have a chance to get an email to get into the front of the line. GameStop also continues to receive bundles. And if you're not already on Twitter keeping an eye out for inventory drops at the major retailers you should be: They're happening more and more often.

If you're willing to shell out way more than the sticker price you can get a PlayStation 5 or PS5 bundle at a reseller like eBay or StockX. But our advice is to wait until the console is available at its regular sticker price at retailers like Best Buy Amazon GameStop Target and Walmart. Be sure to check back here often for the latest updates on when retailers might have new console restocks.

Don't give up trying to get one of these. Sony

You can monitor PlayStation 5 stock updates on your own; as mentioned above Twitter is a good source for restock rumors. But we occasionally get word directly from retailers and tipsters about upcoming PS5 console inventory restocks and we update this post immediately. Again be aware: It likely could be months before anything approximating normal inventory levels appears in stores so getting your own PS5 gaming console is likely to be a challenge until summer at the earliest. Below you'll find a list of all the major retailers (and a few high-profile resellers) where you can monitor the video game console's stock and availability.

eBay We don't recommend spending more than retail to get a PS5 but if you must have a console right now eBay is your shortcut to getting a console. That said expect to pay hundreds over list; the average PS5 price on eBay is about $800. See at eBay

StockX If you've exhausted all of the usual retail options and you're willing to pay hundreds over list price you might want to check out StockX an eBay alternative that made its name in the secondary market for sneakers and designer clothing.

Steve McMichael a former Chicago Bears defensive lineman and ex-professional wrestler has been diagnosed with ALS.

On Friday in various interviews given to an array of Chicago-based outlets McMichael 63 revealed he was diagnosed in January with 36-month onset ALS which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.

McMichael who has lost his ability to use both his arms and hands is now bound to a wheelchair and his wife Misty has been his caretaker.

""I promise you this epitaph that I'm going to have on me now? This ain't ever how I envisioned [my life] was going to end"" McMichael told The Chicago Tribune according to ESPN.

McMichael played for the Chicago Bears for 13 years before he later went on to become a professional wrestler for World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) according to USA Today.

The wheelchair that McMichael currently uses was customized and provided to him by the Bears WGN News reported.

Speaking with the outlet McMichael said ""I'm not going to be out in the public anymore …you're not going to see me out doing appearances hell I can't even sign my name anymore and everybody's going to be speculating 'Where's McMichael what's wrong with him?' ""

Hill whose appointment took effect on April 5 was a design adviser at the BIDC before leaving to found the research and development companies Innogen Technologies Inc. and Biogen Biotechnologies Inc. in the clean energy market.

The BIDC said the new CEO had already met with staff to present his vision and approach following a period of orientation at the corporation and had introduced “a laser-focused vision for a BIDC tailored to building a new export economy that can drive growth and transformation”.

The BIDC said Hill’s vision was to “take the corporation back to its core focus with the prioritisation of CAP 340 the Act that established the corporation and outlined its purpose”.

Hill also pointed out the BIDC was an export-focused agency whose functions according to the law by which it was established were “To advise on promote and facilitate the development of export trade; to conduct and facilitate research into investment; industrial development and the export of products and services . . . ; engage in the export of such products and services . . . .”

He emphasised that the functions of the corporation should be contextualised according to their value related to exports.

“Everything we do should be geared towards and support exports for Barbados. Every entrepreneurial client of the corporation from the kitchen maker industrial factory producer to the laptop creative must be thinking exports. Regardless of their size every client can say: “I export!” Export Barbados is who we are and what we do” he said.

Hill is a former European Union scholar a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained product and service innovation specialist (utilising design thinking methodologies) and a doctoral candidate specialising in governance and public policy with a focus on design and economics for Small Island Developing States.

Not so at Amundi Europe’s biggest money manager. In May Yves Perrier its CEO since 2010 will move upstairs and Valérie Baudson his current deputy takes the helm as chief executive. Shareholders have reacted to the news rather well: Amundi’s share price has risen by 11% since it was announced in February.

That shows how much they value continuity at the firm. Under Mr Perrier Amundi’s assets under management and net income more than doubled to €1.7trn ($2.1trn) and €962m by the end of 2020. Its market capitalisation has swollen from €7.5bn in 2015 when it went public to around €15bn. The firm is still a cut below America’s titans: BlackRock for instance manages about $9trn in assets. Yet Amundi is nearly twice as big as its closest continental rival and the only European firm in the global top ten.

Morris Pearl is chair of the Patriotic Millionaires a group of hundreds of high-net-worth people who want millionaires billionaires and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.

Patriotic Millionaires calls for a living wage for US workers and believes that inequality is bad for society and bad for business.

Pearl was a managing director at BlackRock one of the largest investment firms in the world.

Photo: supplied

Patriotic Millionaires this month opened a chapter in the UK and Europe and claims The Warehouse founder Stephen Tindall as a member.

Pearl told Saturday Morning that the main point of the organisation is making the US Congress and other governments understand that wealthy people realise that there is growing inequality which is destabilising society.

He realised this while still working for BlackRock. During a trip to Athens he was trying to put together a deal to save some jobs in the banking sector at the time of the global financial crash.

During a break he noticed a riot was happening in the street below.

""I began to think to myself are we really doing any good for the rest of the people of Greece or anywhere else except for a bunch of bank executives whose jobs we were hopefully saving.

""Shortly after that I decided I'd done enough for the shareholders of BlackRock and I decided to change my career and I've been working fulltime on policy and advocacy work ever since the beginning of 2014.""

He said the wealthy have much more influence over government than the less well off in part because US politicians for example are required to raise huge amounts of money for their own and their party's campaigns.

""They [politicians] spend so much time with the rich people they think they're the only people they have to care about.""

Pearl said that is why his group supports laws seeking to change the system of political funding. In New York where he lives if a person collects a donation of $100 it can be matched eight-fold by a campaign finance organisation if they're interested in running for mayor or other local body positions.

This has opened up political races to anybody instead of just the relatives of rich people.

""But now pretty much anyone can run for office and lot of people do.""

He said currently many members of the US Congress and Supreme Court judges are millionaires.

"" We need to have a government where the government can be independent of outside financial things and represent their constituents.""

Need for tax reforms

Rich people become even wealthier through their investments - stocks and shares that they sell years later - paying between zero and a top rate of 20 percent tax on their gain.

People who work for a living pay much higher tax rates in the US - perhaps as high as 35 percent.

""We just think that's wrong. It makes it harder and harder for the working people to catch up and makes the division between the rich and the poor get greater every year...""

Pearl also advocates a wealth tax. He said US homeowners pay an annual real estate tax based on the value of their property.

Wealthy people don't pay tax on most of their wealth such as their share portfolios or businesses.

It has been estimated that a 2 percent wealth tax on an income of over $US50 million would raise over $4 trillion.

""The very richest among us would not miss it if they only had 98 percent or 97 or 99 percent of the wealth they have now... Our economy needs to be changed because it's not doing a very good job of distributing the resources of the world among the people in our nation or anywhere else for that matter.""

Pearl said philanthropy is not a substitute for politicians making decisions on raising taxation levels so that money can be spent on schools in poor neighbourhoods roading repairs and sewerage systems and all the other infrastructure that helps make life better for local communities.

Change of philosophy needed

He said Patriotic Millionaires - since it was set up 11 years ago - has moved the debate along but has yet to get laws changed that help redistribute wealth in the US.

However its ideas are gaining traction and have spread to Europe and the UK also.

""Our ideas are moving forward. We haven't taken over the world but we're working on it.""

Governments ""doing less stuff"" hasn't worked he said. In the last 40 years a philosophy has dominated and led to governments thinking that they ""are not supposed to do anything"" and instead people should just look out for themselves he said. In that time union membership has dropped dramatically.

""We think America has been very successful when our people - working through their government which is just a name for people working together collectively - has been accomplishing things.""

Pearl said the group is encouraged by the approach being taken by President Joe Biden and his administration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRrcGl0dHNidXJnaHNwb3J0cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8yMy9zaXRlLXN0dWZmLW5ldy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtZ3Jvd3RoLWRr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Site Stuff: Our new investors our growing brand ... and why we're all smiling,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5pZS9pcmlzaC1uZXdzL21hbi1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWFiZHVjdGluZy1naXJsLTE0LXdhcy1hLWNhc2Utb2Ytcm9tZW8tYW5kLWp1bGlldC1nb25lLXdyb25nLWNvdXJ0LXRvbGQvNDAzNTEwMzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man accused of abducting girl (14) was a case of 'Romeo and Juliet gone wrong' court told,"The case of a man accused of abducting a 14-year-old girl has been described as a case of “Romeo and Juliet gone wrong” in court.

Nojus Maculevicius from Blackrock Co Louth is accused of abducting the teenager and travelling across the border into Northern Ireland.

He appeared this morning at Belfast Laganside Magistrates’ Court where he further charged with possessing a Category A indecent image in the form of a Polaroid photograph.

The 18-year-old appeared via Videolink from Musgrave PSNI Station wearing a police issue grey tracksuit.

He was further accused of driving without a licence driving without insurance and driving on a provisional licence unaccompanied.

Defence solicitor Sophie McClintock from Phoenix Law told the court Mr Maculevicius had been involved in a relationship with the 14-year-old for some time and he had only just turned 18 himself in January.

She said: “This is a Romeo and Juliet gone wrong. The IP (Injured Party) came to no harm and she is back safe at home with her family.”

It was claimed the pair had been a relationship with the support of both families.

The solicitor added that no statement had been made to police by the girl herself and said the defendant was in full-time employment and was

training to become an electrical engineer.

She said he had no criminal record either side of the border and this was the first time he had ever been in custody adding he was also a sponsored athlete who was highly thought of at an MMA club where he trains in Dundalk.

A police officer said he could connect Nojus Maculevicius to the charges.

He explained how the girl’s father had alerted the gardaí on April 19 to report his daughter missing.

They were spotted on CCTV in a Tesco supermarket in Newry buying bedding and pillows and where spotted in east Belfast three days later.

A taxi driver had reported having had the pair in his car.

Police objected to bail initially fearing Mr Maculevicius resides in the Republic and had already demonstrated he was capable of evading police having done so for three days despite a high-profile media campaign.

His solicitor said Mr Maculevicius’ parents had offered to put up a £5000 cash surety to secure his release on bail.

Judge Amanda Henderson granted bail but warned the teenager it is “important Nojus that you have absolutely no contact with the injured party in any form through any media or through a third party.”

He was also ordered to surrender his Lithuanian passport.

He is due to reappear in court next month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5pZS9uZXdzLzY4OTc0OTAvbG91dGgtbWFuLW5vanVzLW1hY3VsZXZpY2l1cy0xOC1jaGFyZ2VkLWFiZHVjdGlvbi_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uaWUvbmV3cy82ODk3NDkwL2xvdXRoLW1hbi1ub2p1cy1tYWN1bGV2aWNpdXMtMTgtY2hhcmdlZC1hYmR1Y3Rpb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Louth man Nojus Maculevicius 18 charged with abduction of girl 14 in case of ‘Romeo and Juliet gone w...,"ABDUCTION CASE Louth man Nojus Maculevicius 18 charged with abduction of girl 14 in case of ‘Romeo and Juliet gone wrong’

Representing the accused solicitor Sophie McClintock said her client was in full employment had no criminal record adding: “His family are extremely supportive of him.”

McClintock insisted: “This is a Romeo and Juliet gone wrong. No harm came to either of the parties and the injured party is at home safe with her family.”

A police officer objected to bail amid concerns Maculevicius would not return to Northern Ireland to face legal proceedings if he was allowed return home to the Republic.

The court was told a picture found in the accused’s wallet had been classified as a “category A” indecent image.

McClintock said the accused’s parents were willing to offer a £5000 cash surety as an assurance he would return to court. She said the accused was also willing to offer €4000.

District judge Amanda Henderson granted bail with a number of conditions.

Those included £500 bail from the accused and a further £5000 cash surety that he is to reside at an address agreed by the PSNI that he surrender his passport and that he have no contact whatsoever with the alleged victim.

The case was listed for a further hearing on May 4."

She has more than 20 years of experience as a tech investor and executive in Israel with leadership roles in venture capital banking and consulting Blackstone said.Gillerman will become chairman of Blackstone Israel and continue to serve as an adviser.Until now Blackstone has had only a few relatively small investments in Israel it said. Last summer the company participated in a $25 million funding round for cybersecurity validation company Pcysys.The new Israeli office will give the firm a much stronger presence here and Gillerman said he was confident that several local investments would be made in the near future.Blackstone will focus on investing in mature growth-stage companies and will not be competing with local venture-capital funds Gillerman said.“We are increasingly focused on investing in fast-growing sectors such as technology life sciences and the digital economy” Blackstone chairman CEO and co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman said. “Israel is one of the most promising markets in the world in these areas and Yifat is the perfect choice to scale our firm’s presence and investments there.”There had been talk of Blackstone developing an Israeli presence in the past including talks in 2012 of a joint venture with Israel’s Blackstone Group. However those never materialized.“We are big believers in Israel which is one of the most dynamic and innovative markets in the world” said Jon Korngold global head of Blackstone Growth. “I’m delighted to welcome Yifat an outstanding technology executive and leader to help us bring the full power of the Blackstone platform and our resources to the country’s entrepreneurs.”Prior to serving as the CEO of Bank Leumi ’s technology banking platform Oron spent most of her career as a partner at Vertex Venture Capital where she invested in and served as a board member of companies across the tech ecosystem.Before that she was a technology investment-banking associate at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York and spent three years at the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of R&D where she achieved the rank of lieutenant in the Economics Budget and Control Department.

The office will be run by Yifat Oron the former CEO of LeumiTech the tech banking arm of Bank Leumi Le-Israel. As senior managing director and head of Blackstone’s office Oron will set up a team to vet companies for investment from the US firm’s recently raised inaugural $4.5 billion growth equity fund Blackstone Growth (BXG).

Blackstone Growth in March completed the final close of its inaugural fund touted as the largest first-time growth equity private fund ever raised.

Israel — which is undergoing a transformation from Start-Up Nation in which entrepreneurs set up companies and sell them quickly to the highest bidder to Scale-Up Nation in which entrepreneurs hold on to their firms in a bid to grow them into multi-million or multi-billion-dollar firms — is “ripe enough” to be a recipient of the “big checks” Blackstone is looking to write to help these sorts of firms grow even faster Oron said in a phone interview.

“You have companies that are Israeli originated with Israeli management and founders who become global leaders and they are worth billions and hopefully tens of billions” Oron said. “All of a sudden Israel is ripe enough to be a relevant partner for an entity like Blackstone. The stars are aligned to have Blackstone on the ground here.”

Israeli tech firms are raising record amounts of money at multi-million and over a billion-dollar valuations as entrepreneurs seek to grow their firms.

To be a significant local player you need to have senior leadership on the ground that can lead the deals and not do it from afar Oron said. Setting up an office in Israel says: “We mean business we want to do business with Israel” she added.

Dan Gillerman a former Israeli ambassador to the UN has served as a senior adviser to Blackstone in Israel since 2013. Now with the establishment of Blackstone’s new office Gillerman will become chairman of Blackstone Israel continuing to serve as an adviser to the firm and the Israel-based team the statement said.

“We are big believers in Israel which is one of the most dynamic and innovative markets in the world. I’m delighted to welcome Yifat an outstanding technology executive and leader to help us bring the full power of the Blackstone platform and our resources to the country’s entrepreneurs” said Jon Korngold global head of Blackstone growth in the statement.

Blackstone’s activity typically has focused on private equity investment in which the firm sought control or bought up appropriate targets. With the new $4.5 billion fund the company is expanding its activities to investing in later-stage startups not necessarily for control of the firm Oron explained.

“We don’t intend to compete with anybody on the ground” Oron said referring to VC and other funds active in Israel. “We want to collaborate with every fund here.” The growth of Israel’s tech firms into later-stage companies “exactly fits” with Blackstone’s strategy she said.

The amounts invested by the fund will typically be “tens of millions of dollars or even hundred of millions and if needed more. It is big checks “the amounts of which have not been seen in Israel previously she said.

Oron said the pool of money at her disposal will be the global fund. “We are not capped” she said. “If we find tons of interesting companies we will invest in all of them.”

The fund plans not just to invest in the firms but also to add value to them by helping them recruit specialists in the US and use the vast networking apparatus available to the Blackstone executives Oron said.

Over the last four years this current senior class has gone to two Super Bowls lost a coach and lost a player to cancer. This past year COVID-19 presented the latest challenge for the Beavers.

""It's amazing what these kids have gone through"" BVT head football coach Jim Archibald said. ""Now to have their junior and senior years ripped away from them because of a global pandemic. So just to be able to get out here for these eight weeks and be with these guys they make it fun every day.""

The Beavers concluded their Fall II season with a 37-14 victory over Uxbridge on Saturday. The win capped a topsy-turvy season filled with postponements and cancellations.

""It's tough not knowing who you're going to play from week to week"" Archibald said. ""We have the Leicester game canceled and then a day later we get Sutton and have a half-a-day to watch film we have practice in the gym and we come out and pitch a shutout.""

The players themselves? They were just thankful to have a season.

""Nothing was guaranteed"" senior Cam Gallagher said. ""We weren't guaranteed a season we weren't guaranteed any games at all. So being able to play is just amazing.""

The reality that this season wouldn't be like any other hit home right away as BVT's first game against Uxbridge was postponed because of coronavirus concerns.

""We were ready to go right away and then we got quarantined for 10 days"" Archibald said.

When the Beavers returned to game action nine days later they were blown out by Northbridge. After that BVT (4-1) didn't lost a game and outscored opponents 177-22 over its final four games.

On Saturday the Beavers took an early 7-0 lead with 4:21 left in the first quarter on a 10-yard rushing touchdown by Gallagher. BVT then extended its lead to 14-0 after a 14-yard TD run by Mateo capped a 13-play scoring drive with 8:27 left in the second quarter.

On their next drive after a Mateo interception on defense the Beavers extended their lead to 21-0 on a 30-yard touchdown pass to Carl Muanaya off of a triple-reverse flea flicker with 7:17 left in the first half.

""We've been working on that reverse pass for awhile"" Archibald said. ""Not once in practice were we able to complete it. But we had the lead favorable field position after the turnover so we decided to go for it and we made the handoff. Angelo made the throw and Carl (Muanaya) made the catch and it's a great play. It certainly seemed to open some things up a bit.""

Muanaya admits he was part of the reason why the Beavers weren't able to complete the flea flicker in practice.

""I ran (the route) wrong a couple times"" Muanaya said.

""This was actually the first time he actually ran it right"" Gallagher added.

Gallagher started the scoring in the second half with a pick-six and then the Spartans fumbled a snap in the end zone for a safety which gave the Beavers a 30-7 lead heading into the fourth quarter.

Muanaya proceeded to cap the scoring for BVT with a 16-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 37-7 with 9:53 left in the fourth quarter.

""(This season has been) therapeutic"" Archibald said. ""I think we all needed this in some way or another to get back out onto the field with the guys.""

Many of BVT's 19 seniors were members of the 2018 team that won a Division 7 state championship. The Beavers dedicated that season to assistant coach Derek Yancik who died from pancreatic cancer earlier in the year.

This season was BVT’s first since losing Tony Pena a former player who died from brain cancer in 2020.

""It’s tough to lose somebody but every day we break the huddle saying (Pena's) name giving it all for him"" Gallagher said. ""We play for him.""

And the Blackstone Valley Tech football team played through adversity this Fall II season. The Beavers are used to it by now.

In a statement GDC Technics CEO Brad Foreman said the job cuts are the direct result of Boeing firing the company.

In a letter to the Texas Workforce Commission GDC said it anticipated most operations at its Fort Worth headquarters would cease. It also would close its San Antonio facility where the Air Force One work was done.

There was no immediate comment Friday from Chicago-based Boeing.

Boeing had sued GDC accusing it of running into financial problems and missing deadlines causing millions in damages to Boeing and jeopardizing work critically important to the U.S. Air Force and the president.

In response GDC countersued Boeing alleging that Boeing mismanagement caused the delays that Boeing failed in its contractual obligations to the subcontractors including failing to pay what GDC was due for its work. It also alleges that Boeing has damaged GDC’s reputation with the Pentagon.

The U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing a $3.9 billion contract in 2018 to convert two Boeing 747-8 planes into the iconic presidential jets and deliver them by December 2024. Boeing hired GDC for work on Air Force One and other executive planes used to carry government officials.

Boeing is currently working on electrical power upgrades communication systems executive interiors and other work on the planes at a Boeing facility in San Antonio a Boeing spokeswoman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQva2xtLXZpYXNhdC13aWZpLTczN3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KLM starts flying Viasat-fitted 737s after installing amid Covid-19 -,"KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is now offering Viasat’s high-speed inflight connectivity service to passengers on two Boeing 737-800s and will fit another 16 737-800s with the system by the end of the year. The installs are part a larger agreement with Viasat that will also see 21 of KLM’s Embraer E-195 twinjets equipped in time.

Installing a broadband IFC system onto any aircraft is always a notable occurrence. After all onboard Internet is considered a key amenity for modern travelers. But installing a system amid a global pandemic — and factoring in lockdowns travel restrictions and the winter holidays — can add material complexity to the equation.

Viasat’s airline customers handle the installations whether in-house or via their select MRO partners. The company’s high-capacity Ka-band satellite solution takes roughly three days to install on a 737 inclusive of the antenna install atop the aircraft fuselage.

Don Buchman Viasat’s vice president and general manager commercial aviation tells Runway Girl Network that the Carlsbad California-based satellite operator and aero ISP was able to support KLM throughout the process remotely.

With several years worth of history and knowledge in Ka-band satcom installs the process went “almost perfect” confides Buchman. “We can do most of it almost entirely remotely from a support perspective.”

He adds:

They can do it almost on autopilot.

All KLM aircraft earmarked for the Viasat IFC system operate European flight routes only. Having provided the Internet service free-of-charge starting 22 April for a week KLM will initially offer three inflight connectivity packages — messaging surf and stream — on all Viasat-equipped aircraft which transmit data over Viasat’s high-capacity KA-SAT satellite.

The messaging option will give all passengers 30-minutes of free text messaging via WhatsApp Facebook Messenger and WeChat while the higher-bandwidth surf and stream options can be purchased though we await clarity on the price points for KLM’s short-haul operation.

Offering three tiers of connectivity service including a free messaging tier is intentional and brings a level of consistency to passengers. While the Air France short-haul fleet offers Global Eagle Ku-band connectivity Air France-KLM’s longhaul operation has been installing Gogo’s 2Ku broadband connectivity solution to Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s.

Nearly 80 widebodies are understood to have been fitted with Gogo 2Ku to date. And these aircraft offer three tiers of Internet service to passengers.

Notably given that Air France-KLM’s Boeing 787s are fitted with Panasonic Avionics’ eXConnect Ku-band connectivity service the airline holding company now technically has knowledge of no fewer than four inflight connectivity systems.

“Being Internet connected when on-the-go is a top priority for our customers. That’s why we’re working with Viasat to specifically define and tailor an inflight Wi-Fi approach that meets current and future IFC requirements on short- and medium-haul European flights” says KLM executive vice president customer service Boet Kreiken in a statement.

“We believe this new collaboration will enable us to deliver more memorable connected experiences when passengers fly on Viasat-equipped KLM aircraft.”

As passengers return to the skies “they’ll come back to this great new service” notes Buchman to RGN.

“The Boeing 717-200 is a twin-engine jet with capacity for 115 passengers in a three-class configuration and thanks to its operational performance it fits perfectly with the geography of Ecuador and the region” the airline said.

In addition the company confirmed that it will operate Dash 8-Q400 turboprop aircraft domestically and on some cross-border flights. These aircraft can carry up to 78 passengers making them ideal for short-haul domestic flights.

The airline also announced that on April 29 it will virtually launch its Corporate image Frequent Flyer Founder’s Club and Ecuatoriana Boutique programs.

India's ultra-rich are paying tens and thousands of dollars to escape the country as it set a new global record for daily coronavirus infections — for the fourth day in a row.

In the last week India has become the new epicenter of the virus which has completely overwhelmed the country's healthcare system and crematoriums and has led to a dire shortage of oxygen.

On Sunday public health officials reported 349691 new COVID-19 cases in the country according to Sky News. They also reported 2767 deaths another daily record as some nations announced they would implement travel restrictions on visitors from India.

One popular destination seems to be the United Arab Emirates which is only a short distance away from India and usually operates hundreds of flights there. It announced this week that it was barring the entry of travelers from India for 10 days from April 25 according to Gulf News.

This month it’s the turn of another Sicilian town Castiglione di Sicilia to offer houses for the price of a coffee.

On the slopes of Mount Etna near chic Taormina and the beaches of Sicily’s east coast the town is selling a bumper crop of houses: roughly 900 abandoned homes.

Most are located in the oldest parts of the town. Around half are ruined and will be given away at a symbolic price of €1 ($1.20). The rest are in better condition and will be sold off cheaply starting from €4000- €500.

Mayor Antonino Camarda has undertaken an ambitious project to breathe new life into his village where the population has shrunk from 14000 in the early 1900s to barely 3000 today.

“We have a huge architectural heritage to rescue packed with history. Over time too many people have left leaving behind a bunch of old picturesque houses many even dating back to the Renaissance” he says.

Where some other towns operating similar schemes have put together a job lot of houses for €1 Castiglione di Sicilia is pricing the properties according to their condition.

“We’ve carried out an in-depth study cataloguing each property based on maps and land registry data. According to their conditions buildings will be sold at different prices starting from €1” says Camarda.

If there’s a lot of interest for the same property an auction will be held.

A bumper crop

The scheme which launched in March 2021 is the largest of its kind with at least 400 properties in the town that are in a decent shape and require minimal renovation.

Want to snap one up? Potential buyers should get in touch with a detailed plan of what kind of house they’d like and how they’d renovate it in order to best match demand with supply and help liaise between parties. A special task force has been set up to oversee the project.

“We are moving along two parallel paths: reaching out to old owners who are showing great interest in getting rid of their family homes and new buyers” says Camarda.

“We have already received many emails from investors and people across the world. There’s a wide choice here.”

So what’s the catch? Buyers must complete renovations within three years. Unlike most other schemes however there’s no deposit payable to guarantee doing the works.

Instead they require owners to take out an insurance policy from a bank worth €4000.

“It would cost the new owner €100 per year which seems a fairer sum then a deposit guarantee” says Camarda.

Local taxes are low in Sicily compared to the rest of Italy. Buyers can also take advantage of the Italian government’s “superbonus” scheme that dishes out tax credits of 110% for renovations which make houses more environmentally friendly.

Lava lions and lots of wine

Perched on a rocky cliff on the northern slope of Mount Etna Castiglione di Sicilia overlooks the breathtaking Alcantara valley whose deep chasms and canyons are dubbed “gole” (meaning “gorges” in Italian.)

Cut by clear streams ponds and waterfalls they’re formed by solidified volcanic lava created during past eruptions from the volcano. Woods olive groves orange orchards hazelnut plantations and wine estates dot the landscape.

On the jet-black fertile flanks of Etna vineyards make premium bottles with indigenous grapes including carricante catarratto and nerello. Castiglione is dubbed the “city of wine” — a huge sculpture of a barrel and wine glass stands at the entrance to the village. Guided tours are organized along the Etna wine route.

Etna is Europe’s largest active volcano and the land is dotted with lava caves pine forests and old lava flows. River trekking rafting canyoning biking horse riding and nordic walking trails unwind across the landscape and its dark lava-colored hills are dotted with ruined Greek fortresses and Byzantine chapels with secret tunnels.

Castiglione di Sicilia is said to have been founded on the ashes of prehistoric settlements in 403 BC by refugees from the seaside settlement of Naxos near modern Taormina when it was conquered by a tyrant.

Its name derives from “the Castle of the Lions” and Castiglione’s coat of arms still features two lions standing guard. For centuries it was a vibrant and powerful fiefdom and one of Sicily’s strategic and most prosperous outposts nicknamed the “fiery” town by Frederick II the 13th-century Holy Roman Emperor and king of Sicily.

The town is a member of I Borghi Più Belli d’Italia an association of some of Italy’s prettiest historical towns. Roads and walls are made with dark lava rock cobblestones while aristocratic mansions are juxtaposed with humble dwellings.

“Our territory is vast and goes from the snow-capped peak of Etna all the way downhill close to the sea. There are lots of things to do and beautiful spots to see” says Camarda.

Ghost towns looking for new blood

Racked along the hillside the town is divided into several districts set at different altitudes. The old center is a maze of arched cobbled alleyways and buildings featuring decorated portals with gargoyles. Giudecca the Jewish quarter and one of the oldest areas of town is packed with clusters of abandoned stone houses with thick if ruined walls.

Most of the empty buildings in this area have a unique look shaped like little turrets with various entrances from different streets for the multiple families who used to live in them.

Houses for sale line the main road that winds uphill to the majestic castle which crowns the town and a panoramic piazza paved with lava stones.

There’s a range of properties for sale. The €1 homes tend to be dilapidated cottages once owned by shepherd and farming families while the more expensive options include elegant little palazzos where the rural bourgeoisie lived. Vegetation emerges from windows and through the roofs of the ruined houses and doorsteps are covered in moss and prickly pear branches. Decorated doors swinging off their hinges and flower-patterned wrought iron balconies show the glory of past times.

Many former residents of the town migrated to Australia and South America in search of a brighter future. Their descendants never returned allowing the family homes to fall into oblivion.

“Based on the population and land registry we’re tracking down many heirs by word of mouth knocking at the doors of elders who are still in contact or know where those families migrated to. It’s a small place — people know each other” says Michele La Rosa a member of the mayor’s special task force.

The wine-filled nightlife

The closest beach is Marina di Cottone a 40-minute drive away with a long strip of sand and dunes ideal for families with kids.

And there’s food to match that great wine. Local specialities include maccheroni pasta with pork ragu sauce and baked ricotta and tagghiani pasta with nettle and wild rabbit. Meat lovers can indulge in barbecues of baby goat lamb and pork. Then there’s the sweet stuff: sciauni (delicious ricotta-filled pancakes) cuddureddi fig biscuits and zeppole rice buns.

In the evenings the locals have a glass of Etna wine accompanied with local hazelnuts almonds and pistachios. Meanwhile the summer food and wine festivals pull in the gourmands. Every August 10 the town holds a “Chalices of Stars” wine tasting evening with top producers to celebrate the famously clear night of Saint Sylvester said to be good for watching shooting stars.

Australia’s fast bowler who is also one of the fastest bowlers in the world Pat Cummins and his life partner Becky Boston have purchased an excellent home in Sydney for $9.5 million. Some significant sources have affirmed that the team Australia’s vice captain and his accomplice have spent a gigantic sum for a magnificently restored Victorian estate home in Bronte which is a beachside area in Sydney New South Wales. The 27-year-old star cricketer as of now claims two properties however this one property is expressed to have been enlisted under the couple’s name. Cummins is accounted for to get hitched to Boston soon who is an architect as well as an interior designer.

The house likewise has exclusive spaces for entertainment purposes alongside a trendy kitchen with a marble island seat. There is a warmed mosaic-tiled pool inside the enormous grass. The no.1 Test bowler had gone down on his knee to propose Becky Boston during the cookout date they arranged. The best bowler is now all set to marry his fiance.

The couple has been together for quite a while. They had lived in a rambling home in the Southern Highlands for quite a bit of 2020. With the covid situation all the cricketers were in disguise Pat Cummins and his fiance were no different.

They had kept themselves separated there during the underlying period of COVID-19 in Australia.

""On behalf of all of us citizens on this occasion of the South Shore Science Festival do hereby deem it an honor and pleasure to declare Saturday April 24 2021 'Dr. Fred Calef III day' "" Harris said. ""As children look up into the sky they can be inspired by work like yours that will give them a sense of hope looking past their horizon looking to the future.""

The Quincy native was the keynote speaker at the virtual event where he answered questions from moderator Kasha Patel a NASA writer at the Goddard Space Flight Center and from those in attendance.

Calef grew up in Quincy and graduated from Quincy High School in 1987 before he attended UMass Boston Ohio University and the University of Alaska. Calef said he first fell in love with rocks exploring the granite quarries of Quincy with his grandfather.

""My grandfather would go 'Here's a piece of Quincy granite' and he would tell me a story about how it formed from magma coming up from under the ground before it solidified or this stream carried these sediments down and they collected and they hardened"" Calef said. ""I thought it was fascinating that you could pick up something that looks maybe at first glance plain or simple or doesn't seem like it would have much to say but it has a lot to say and that always interested me and that led me to science.""

Calef became interested in maps while at UMass Boston where he learned the software to map transportation in Boston and voting precincts in Ohio. Now Calef maps Mars with imagery from rovers and directs the rovers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California.

When Calef was presented with the opportunity to name a couple areas on Mars' Gale Crater Calef named the two areas for his hometown: Quincy and Squantum and their special rocks.

""You can't find these rocks in many places but you can find them in Squantum and Quincy. I thought that was important and they're always my go to for local rocks so that's why I pulled the names out"" Calef said.

During his presentation Calef showed Mars' Quincy and Mars' Squantum as well as the maps he works on and images of the geology from the Mars rovers.

Calef's segment was one of many planned for the South Shore Science Festival which is usually hosted in the Quincy Center for Innovation but has been hosted virtually since the start of the pandemic. The festival also had programming about the science of light and trees 3D printing a tour of Boston Scientific and a talk from immunologist and 1996 Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty.

""It's really been an honor to speak with all of you especially my hometown. The inspiration I would say is you can do it I'm here because I asked and I wanted to do it"" Calef said. ""I came from Quincy I come from a dad who was basically a mechanic and my mom did data entry and I don't have a prestigious background. Anyone can do this you just have to ask. If you're interested go tell someone you're interested and pursue it you really can do it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vYWxsdG9nZXRoZXIuc3dlLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA0L2RvZXMteW91ci1qb2ItaGVscC1wZW9wbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SWEet Wisdom: How Does Your Job Help People? - All Together,"We as students have always dreamt of having a job where we could feel connected to people or know we are helping them. So we decided to reach out to some women engineers to see how they feel they are helping others in their careers! See what they had to say!

How does your job help people? Do you feel connected to the end-user?

Connecting software development to helping people is a wide gap that’s more difficult to bridge than more physical engineering disciplines. Whether your end-user is another member of your team via an internal application or tool or one of millions of end-users of a global application the physical needs that are met by digital services can be seen everywhere. My favorite example is an Alexa-enabled microwave. One of the 1-star reviews on its amazon.com listing is something to the effect of “Why is this even necessary if you can physically put food in the microwave you can use the keypad you don’t need an AI personal assistant to do it for you.” One of the 5-star reviews describes how it has revolutionized her husband’s life he’s blind and can prepare food by touch but can’t use a traditional digital microwave key pad because he has no idea what button he’s pressing. Something that most people feel is a luxury “first world problem” convenience device can make a huge difference in providing autonomy and independence for someone else. The same dichotomy applies to grocery delivery. It’s a modern convenience for some but for those who are disabled home-bound or are single parents of small children it can relieve a huge burden of having to physically go to a store to get the basic groceries and home items we need on a daily basis. Making sure we have more diverse people with the right skills to create more diverse solutions – and come up with more diverse problems to solve – is a big part of SWE’s mission!

I work on the Chinook tandem rotor helicopter which is flown by the US Army National Guards and many military organizations throughout the world. My job is to make sure that the helicopters we deliver to our customers meet all of their requirements and are safe to fly. I am only one of a very large team of engineers from the designers to the manufacturing engineers but even after so many years I still get a chill and a sense of pride when I hear how one of our helicopters was used in a mountain-top rescue mission here in the US a humanitarian mission abroad or fight fires in California. I hear about it in the news but also through my connections in these organizations. Those reports never get old!

My job as a civil engineer helps communities through problem solving. As a bridge engineer I help people by maintaining and creating ways to get people where they need to go. The U.S. has 600000 bridges and over 30% are 50 years or older so I also help people through extending the life of several existing bridges through my bridge reconstruction and inspection work. The projects I work on make bridges safe for millions of people to cross over. While I may not know each and every end-user of each bridge it gives me great satisfaction to be able to positively impact a large group of people through my work! Generally speaking any career in STEM is awesome because we build and create the world through our jobs.

District Engineer Woodmoor Water

I work for a water and sanitation district. We help people in both residential and commercial settings by providing them clean and safe drinking water as well as treating their waste water. Citizens require water to drink cook shower wash flush away their waste among other uses. Doctors require water for keeping their tools and equipment sanitized and it is essential that they have access to clean water as they treat patients who may have compromised immune systems. Restaurants use water to cook and clean utensils. I am sure you can come up with a multitude of other uses but those are a few off the top of my head.

If we did not have clean water during this pandemic things would be very different right now. My job is to ensure the infrastructure that gets water from the treatment facilities to the customers is safe clean and in good working condition. A part of my job is to make sure new infrastructure is installed properly and to find ways to make our system more efficient.

I feel connected to the customers in our water and sanitation district not only because of the conversations I have with some of them individually whether it be during construction or at a board meeting but also because I care very deeply that our customers and truly all people are able to have access to clean water. There is so much more to it such as keeping the waterways clean finding sources of renewable water supplies restoration of existing systems providing education to those who seek it economic impacts local and national laws and regulations… I find all of it interesting and meaningful and am grateful to be a part of this complex industry.

Each of the featured women is a member of the Asian Connections Affinity Group (ACAG) one of many affinity groups within SWE.

Margaret Omori — ACAG Vice Lead

Margaret grew up in Evanston Illinois just a block away from the house where her dad grew up. Margaret has a lot of family in the Chicago area and was lucky to have a strong support system nearby who encouraged her to pursue her love of STEM from a young age. Some of her earliest memories include building rockets in the park with her dad and creating LEGO cities with her older brother. As Margaret progressed through high school her favorite classes were math chemistry and physics which inspired her to study Chemical Engineering at Yale University. Today Margaret is a Project Manager at ExxonMobil for environmental remediation projects based out of Brooklyn New York. She loves being able to use her problem-solving and quantitative reasoning skills from her engineering degree in her day job. In her free time Margaret still loves building LEGO creations—it’s a wonderful hobby that blends art with STEM. She is also an avid reader and a Peloton enthusiast.

As an Asian-American woman in a white male-dominated industry having AAPI women role models has been crucial to her professional development. In particular Margaret’s first Team Lead at ExxonMobil Chui Mei Cheung inspired her at a critical point in her career. Transitioning from school—where her success was based on grades and academic achievements—to the workplace—where success can be much more nebulous—was difficult. It seemed like there was a mysterious path to success that she didn’t understand. Having an Asian-American woman in a leadership position to look up to helped Margaret navigate this new uncharted territory. This leader mentored Margaret on how to communicate effectively advocate for herself and her ideas and influence without authority. Seeing the business accomplishments this leader had achieved helped Margaret believe that a position in leadership could be possible in her future too. Margaret feels lucky to have found such a mentor and she hopes that the ACAG can help connect more mentors and mentees going forward.

Kristine Loh — ACAG Community Lead

Kristine Loh (she/her) is a first-year Chemical Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities. She is a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and a College of Science and Engineering Fellow. As a member of the Ferry and Kortshagen Lab Groups her research focuses on luminescent nanoparticles for solar windows on greenhouses. She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering and her M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Drexel University in 2020 where she was heavily involved in undergraduate research and the Drexel SWE section. She pursued chemical engineering in college because she took pre-engineering classes in high school where she first learned about manufacturing and realized for the first time that she could actually see herself as an engineer. Kristine was born and raised in a town near Miami Florida and in her free time she enjoys experimenting with her air fryer trying out new restaurants and volunteering at K-12 STEM engagement events. Someone who inspires her is Dr. Jayshree Seth who also studied chemical engineering and has made great strides in creating inclusive environments for women in STEM.

Kalyani Mallela—SWE Board of Directors Member

Kalyani Mallela was born in India where she grew up surrounded by engineers. At a young age she developed a keen understanding of all the ways an engineer can impact the world and it became obvious: she would be an engineer. Inspired and supported by her parents she earned her B.S. in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Osmania University in India. She then moved to the Twin Cities where she received her M.S. in Management of Technology and Electrical Engineering both from the University of Minnesota.

Kalyani is currently a Director of Research and Development (R&D) for Ethicon part of the Johnson & Johnson Medical Device companies. As a leader in the Robotics and Digital Solutions group she owns instrument development providing solutions to improve outcomes across a broad range of disease states. She leads both internal and external design partnerships for instrument and accessory development. Kalyani is passionate about people and developing an inclusive culture focusing on talent development mentorship and coaching.

As a woman dedicated to outreach and developing future engineers each year Kalyani connects with over 2000 children through classroom visits hands-on activities and mentoring. She shares her experiences as an engineering student and professional hoping to inspire girls to pursue technical opportunities. Kalyani is an active SWE member and has served as a Section President Senator Awards & Recognition Committee Chair and Society Nominating Committee member. She currently serves as a Director on the SWE Board of Directors.

Kalyani derives inspiration from Sudha Murty known for her grassroots work serving the under-privileged across India. Sudha’s social work has covered healthcare education women empowerment public hygiene rural development art and culture and poverty alleviation. Sudha was the first female engineering student at her college and the first female engineer hired at India’s largest automotive manufacturer. Sudha is known for the quote “Philanthropy has nothing to do with money. It’s a warm hug a kind word…that can change lives. It’s about helping fellow human beings.” Through her life Sudha has shown us that there is always help you can offer humankind even without access to money. Kalyani believes that Sudha is a woman to admire thank and strive to be more like.

At first glance not very much apparently. However one woman is bringing her expertise and discipline from regulating the manufacturing of medicines which are vital for human survival to another area necessary for our shared and continued existence – education.

Below we get an insight into the make-up of one woman who is bent on ensuring that standards are met and kept from the boardroom to the classroom.

Early years and education

Dr. Haggar Hilda Ampadu was born at the Kwahu Tafo Government Hospital to ‘neighbours’ Charles Ampadu and Mary Ampadu of Kwahu Nteso in the Eastern Region. The first child of three she was a sociable child.

Aged seven the family moved to Accra ostensibly to have better economic opportunities. There Hilda began her education at the Methodist Nursery School at Abeka Lapaz as a very sociable child. Recounting her earliest memories of school the self-described talkative says that her amiable character endeared her to teachers and fellow learners alike.

“I remember enjoying my time in school” she says this is despite the family scarcely having an adequate supply of electricity at home leading to her oftentimes reading and doing her homework off the illumination from the fluorescent bulb from her neighbour’s house.

She then attended the Harrow International School also at Abeka Lapaz where she remained from kindergarten to year six. She proceeded to the Junior High School (JHS) arm of the same school which was under government supervision and was known as the Abeka 4 JHS. There she emerged as the second best student at the terminal Basic Examination Certificate Examination.

Subsequently in 1993 she gained admission into the prestigious Wesley Girls’ High School where she says the rudiments of discipline excellence and being methodical were instilled.

Having an affinity for the arts she had set her sights on becoming a lawyer. However due to her excellent score at the school’s mandatory entrance examination she was encouraged to take up the sciences and that set her on a course in science pharmacy health and now education.

In 1997 she was admitted to the nation’s premier institution of higher learning in the sciences the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) for a Bachelor of Science (BSc) programme in Biological Sciences. Upon graduation in 2001 she departed for the United States with the intention of furthering her education. In the U.S.A she gained admission into Boston University where she obtained a Master of Science (MSc) in Project Management by 2010.

Four years later she enrolled at the Utrecht University for Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Pharmaceutical Policy & Medicines Regulation graduating in 2018. There her Field Research was concentrated in Medicine Regulation/Pharmacovigilance/Pharmacoepidemiology

Career Progression

Upon her arrival in the U.S.A she spent a year – beginning in 2002 – as a Clinical Data Manager (Consultant) for GSK’s Diabetes Clinical Trials at clinical research organisation (CRO) Parexel.

From there she held similar positions as Clinical Data Manager for Addiction (Opioid Dependence and Alcohol Dependence) at Alkermes and Cardiovascular Interventions (Coronary Stents) at Boston Scientific Corporation from 2003 to 2005 and 2005 to 2007 respectively.

Hilda then assumed the role of Senior Clinical Data Manager (Consultant) for Oncology (Bone Sarcomas) Clinical Trials at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. for one year. She proceeded to the Premier Research Group where she was Senior Data Manager for Johnson & Johnson Medical’s Orthopedics (Spine) Clinical Trials between June 2008 and May 2009. Between 2009 and 2011 she reprised the same role in Epidemiological Studies (Health/Bone Surveys) at the New England Research Institutes Inc.

Her career followed a similar trajectory after her graduate programme in project management as she was Project Manager (Data Management) for Cardiovascular Interventions (Coronary Stents) Clinical Trials at Abbott Vascular and Project Manager (Consultant) for Oncology (Leukemia) Clinical Trials at Infinity Pharmaceuticals for six months each from January to December 2011.

According to her “My intention had always been to return to Ghana after furthering my studies and making strides in my career. I had given myself a 10-year period in which to do that.”

Return to Ghana and WHO

True to form she returned to Ghana in 2012 exactly a decade after she left. Upon her return she joined the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Advocacy & Training in Pharmacovigilance (WHO-CC) as Deputy Director of the Ghana Office.

At the WHO her core duty revolved around policy; Medicine Regulation Policy. Here she offered support to 36 countries in Africa in developing medicine policies. The role required direct interventions in all 36 countries ensuring that she visited all 36 countries multiple times to interact with the Food and Drug Authorities (FDAs) Ministries of Health and health regulatory agencies to develop policies on monitoring of medicines.

NaSIA

Following then-Minister responsible for Education Matthew Opoku Prempeh’s desire to model Ghana’s National Inspectorate Board (NIB) after the United Kingdom’s Office for Standards in Education Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) Hilda was appointed to head the institution which was to become the National Schools Inspectorate Authority (NaSIA).

Originally doubtful she could succeed in the Education Sector she soon realised that the principles of regulation – policy implementation and enforcement were the same experience. The only significant difference was the field of operation.

Describing the transition as seamless she said: “The same principles applies with the collection of data and using the evidence to make decisions on how schools are performing and using the operational evidence to create policies. With this we can ensure that our standards are based on real documents and not merely hearsay.”

The Inspector-General of Schools suggests that the discipline from working in stringent environments in the U.S which has informed her very regimented approach to duty has contributed in no small way to her easing into the new role.

NaSIA under her leadership is undergoing an aggressive transformation agenda with the goal of ensuring that learners in pre-tertiary schools in the country meet learning outcomes in safe and serene learning environments.

Boards

As one of three women heading one of the 22 agencies under the Ministry of Education Hilda sits on the boards of several institutions. These include Ghana Health Service Council; University Governing Council of the Accra Technical University (ATU) formerly Accra Polytechnic; University Governing Council of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST); West African Examinations Council (WAEC); and National Council for Curriculum & Assessment (NaCCA) Ministry of Education.

Future endeavors

Hilda has expressed a strong desire to return to her alma mater KNUST to teach at the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. She is also keen to contribute her quota to improve regulation of medicines in the country. She is also very eager to see increased women representation in key institutions adding that young women must not assume that they will be handed positions solely by virtue of them being women but should be ready to put in the hard work and distinguish themselves.

Family

Dr. Haggar Hilda Ampadu is married with two children; a son and a daughter; who is keen on becoming a lawyer."

At the 2021 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium Motzer et al presented the clinical results of the CLEAR trial adding a novel regimen lenvatinib plus pembrolizu-mab to the growing armamentarium of first-line treatments for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The findings have been reported by the authors in The New England Journal of Medicine1 and are reviewed in this issue of The ASCO Post.

CLEAR was a phase III clinical trial that randomly assigned 1069 patients with treatment-naive metastatic RCC to lenvatinib at 20 mg daily plus pembrolizumab at 200 mg every 3 weeks lenvatinib at 18 mg daily plus everolimus 5 mg daily or sunitinib 50 mg daily (4 weeks on 2 weeks off) in a 1:1:1 ratio.1 CLEAR met its primary endpoint with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab significantly improving progression-free survival compared to sunitinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.39 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32–0.49; median = 23.9 vs 9.2 months). Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab also improved the objective response rate compared to sunitinib (71.0% vs 36.1%) with an impressive complete response rate of 16.1%. Overall survival was also significantly longer with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab than sunitinib (HR = 0.66 95% CI = 0.49–0.88). In the third arm lenvatinib plus everolimus significantly improved progression-free survival compared to sunitinib (median = 14.7 vs 9.2 months HR = 0.65 95% CI = 0.53–0.83) but overall survival benefit was inconclusive (HR = 1.15 95% CI = 0.88–1.50).

The Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival generated discussion because the survival curves for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib crossed at approximately 34 months. However these -Kaplan-Meier curves can be misleading for at least two reasons. First at the 30-month time point onwards more than 80% of patients from each treatment group have either died or are censored resulting in substantial imprecision of the Kaplan-Meier estimates—which is the reason it has been proposed to refrain from showing Kaplan-Meier curves when only around 10% to 20% of patients remain in follow-up.2 Second the presented Kaplan-Meier curves are marginal estimates that are less precise and less likely to satisfy the proportional hazards assumption than the stratified log rank and Cox regression models used to generate all the major statistical estimates of the CLEAR trial.3

Tolerability of Starting Dose in Question

The regimen of lenvatinib at 18 mg daily plus everolimus at 5 mg daily was approved in 2016 as second-line therapy for patients who experienced progressive disease after one prior antiangiogenic therapy.45 When using this regimen in the second-line and beyond setting dose reductions of lenvatinib are common so the 20-mg daily dose of lenvatinib raises questions about the tolerability of this starting dose. In CLEAR 68.8% of patients receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab required dose reductions due to treatment-related adverse events compared to 50.3% with sunitinib. For the patients receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 25.6% discontinued lenvatinib due to treatment-related adverse events 28.7% discontinued pembrolizumab and 13.4% discontinued both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. Although lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is a highly active regimen lenvatinib starting at 20 mg daily appears to be difficult to tolerate for many patients and we do not know how starting lenvatinib at a reduced dose would impact the efficacy of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab. In a phase II trial of 343 patients who had progressive disease on prior antiangiogenic therapy the lenvatinib starting dose of 14 mg daily combined with everolimus at 5 mg daily yielded a numerically lower overall response rate and a shorter progression-free survival than the lenvatinib starting dose of 18 mg daily in combination with everolimus at 5 mg daily.6

Cross-Trial Comparisons

At this time the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab. We anticipate that it will be approved in the near future and when approved it will become the fifth immuno-oncology combination for the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC in addition to nivolumab plus ipilimumab pembrolizumab plus axitinib avelumab plus axitinib and nivolumab plus cabozantinib (Table 1).17-12

It is often appropriately noted that cross-trial comparisons have multiple serious caveats. However clinicians are instinctively inclined to compare trials in large part because such comparisons are contingent on assumptions that are not fundamentally different from the assumptions used in daily practice to generalize or transport inferences from a randomized controlled trial to a specific patient seen in clinic who will often have little in common with the trial population.1314

What is helpful to oncologists who treat patients with RCC is that all the first-line immuno-oncology combination trials to date have used the same comparator (sunitinib) and treated broadly similar populations (Table 1). When comparing treatment options for a specific patient in clinic we should always be mindful that we are making decisions under uncertainty while relying on imperfect data and assumptions—ie the natural habitat for any practicing clinician. Our decisions should ideally be informed by the totality of the available evidence capitalizing on the natural synergy between randomized and real-world observational data.15

Beware however of the most misleading graph in contemporary oncology: forest plots. These plots were originally developed for meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials16 but have more recently become a source of much confusion when used for subgroup analyses in single randomized controlled trials. Case in point: all the forest plots presented from the pivotal immunotherapy combination trials listed in Table 1 tell us only that there is a remarkable constancy of the hazard ratios across patient subgroups. This should not be very surprising since this constancy is a fundamental assumption of many applied statistical models. Instead of looking for subgroup-specific differences in the hazard and odds ratio scales represented by forest plots patient-specific inferences can be much more informed by considering outcome heterogeneity using prognostic information derived from both randomized clinical trial and observational data.1718

Choosing a First-Line Regimen: Choices Abound

The selection of first-line treatment for metastatic RCC should be guided by individual patient characteristics combined with a vision for treatment sequencing to optimize survival. An essential question to consider when selecting a first-line regimen is whether the patient would be a good candidate for the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab. The OMNIVORE TITAN-RCC and HCRN GU16-260 studies suggested that ipilimumab has limited activity after disease progression on immunotherapy-based regimens so if ipilimumab is a desired component of the treatment sequence it should preferably be administered as first-line in combination with nivolumab.19-21

In regard to sequencing subsequent lines of therapy cabozantinib has activity as a single agent after disease progression on nivolumab plus ipilimumab or pembrolizumab plus axitinib.22-24 The activity of cabozantinib after progression on lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is unknown and the overlapping spectrum of tyrosine kinases targeted by cabozantinib and lenvatinib raises concern for cross-resistance. Retrospective data suggest however that lenvatinib plus everolimus has activity in patients after progressive disease on immunotherapy-based regimens and cabozantinib.25 Thus for clinicians who are comfortable managing immune-mediated adverse events first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab might be preferred in patients with International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium intermediate- or poor-risk disease who do not have an urgent need for reduction in tumor volume. We believe ipilimumab is a key component of immunotherapy-based therapy responsible for the durability of major responses and contributing to the potential for a meaningful treatment-free survival.26 First-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab is also currently our preferred treatment for patients with advanced clear cell RCC and sarcomatoid dedifferentiation based on the encouragingly high complete response rate (18.9%) and favorable long-term survival outcomes.27

First-line immunotherapy/tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimens can be selected for patients who have an urgent need for reduction in tumor volume or have highly symptomatic disease especially if they may not get a chance to receive a second-line therapy or have preexisting autoimmune disease precluding anti–CTLA-4 therapy. In these settings lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab should be considered for patients with a strong desire for a complete response irrespective of toxicity or who need an urgent response yet can still tolerate lenvatinib at 20 mg daily. In contrast pembrolizumab plus axitinib or nivolumab plus cabozantinib are suited for clinicians seeking a well-tolerated immunotherapy/tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen with nivolumab plus cabozantinib having demonstrated notable health-related quality of life benefits over sunitinib.12

The inconclusive overall survival results of avelumab plus axitinib have limited its use in metastatic RCC compared with the other immunotherapy combinations.11 Patients with favorable-risk metastatic RCC have many options to consider including active surveillance surgical resection or stereotactic body radiation for oligometastatic disease single-agent VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or immunotherapy combinations.2829 For those patients who cannot receive any immunotherapy lenvatinib plus everolimus may become a reasonable new first-line option if approved and it is a particularly attractive therapy for patients with a history of solid organ transplantation due to the immunomodulatory effects of mTOR inhibition.

‘Powerful’ New Combination for Metastatic RCC

In sum lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab adds a highly active immunotherapy-based regimen to the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC. Clinicians must consider whether the excellent efficacy of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab justifies the toxicity of lenvatinib at 20 mg daily and the questions surrounding treatment sequencing. For these first-line immunotherapy combination doublets long-term follow-up is necessary to identify the fraction of patients who will achieve durable responses to treatment. With the advent of the powerful lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination we may be approaching the efficacy ceiling for doublet combinations in unselected patients with metastatic RCC. Future efforts in this space should explore the value of triplet combinations and biologically driven patient selection.30-33

The parallel POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2 trials showed that 58.7% and 53.6% of patients treated with deucravacitinib had 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75). Additionally 50%-54% of patients in the two trials met the coprimary endpoint of Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0/1. Both outcome values were significantly higher than those observed in placebo-treated patients and in patients randomized to apremilast (Otezla).

All secondary outcomes favored deucravacitinib and achieved statistical superiority versus placebo and apremilast in most cases reported April Armstrong MD of the University Southern California in Los Angeles at the American Academy of Dermatology virtual meeting.

""Significantly greater proportions of patients in the deucravacitinib compared with apremilast arms achieved PASI 75 response at week 16 in both trials"" said Armstrong. ""Deucravacitinib responses increased beyond week 16 and were also superior to apremilast at week 24. More than 80% of deucravacitinib patients who achieved PASI 75 at week 24 and continued treatment maintained PASI 75 response at week 52 in both studies.""

Results for the coprimary outcome mirrored the PASI 75 data as significantly more patients in the deucravacitinib arm achieved PGA 0/1 status at 16 and 24 weeks as compared with placebo and apremilast she added.

""Based on these findings deucravacitinib has the potential to become an efficacious and well tolerated treatment of choice for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis"" Armstrong concluded.

Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) belongs to the Janus kinase (JAK) family of nonreceptor signaling kinases and regulates cytokine signaling implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders including psoriasis. Deucravacitinib has a mechanism of action distinct from that of JAK inhibitors resulting in greater selectivity for TYK2 versus JAK1/3 or JAK2. The drug demonstrated activity in phase II trials of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.

Armstrong reported findings from two global phase III randomized trials to evaluate deucravacitinib in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Investigators enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis associated with a PASI score ≥12 PGA score ≥12 and body surface area (BSA) ≥10%. Patients in both trials were randomized 2:1:1 to deucravacitinib apremilast or placebo. Coprimary endpoints were PASI 75 and PGA 0/1 plus at least a two-step improvement from baseline both assessed at 16 weeks. Patients assigned to placebo could cross over to deucravacitinib at week 16.

Data analysis included 666 patients in POETYK PSO-1 and 1020 patients in POETYK PSO-2. Results from POETYK PSO-1 showed that significantly more patients randomized to deucravacitinib attained a PASI 75 response at week 16 (58.7%) as compared with the apremilast (35.1%) or placebo (12.7%) arms (P<0.0001). Follow-up at week 24 showed PASI 75 response rates of 69% with deucravacitinib and 38.1% with apremilast (P<0.0001).

Similar results emerged from an analysis of POETYK PSO-2 as 53.6% of deucravacitinib-treated patients had a PASI 75 response after 16 weeks as compared with 40.2% with apremilast (P=0.0003) and 9.4% with placebo (P<0.0001). At 24 weeks the deucravacitinib arm maintained a significant advantage versus apremilast (59.3% vs 37.8 P<0.0001).

PGA response data from POETYK PSO-1 showed that 53.6% of the deucravacitinib group had met response criteria by week 16 as compared with 32.1% of those in the apremilast arm and 7.2% of the placebo arm (P<0.0001). At 24 weeks response rates were 58.4% with the TYK2 inhibitor versus 31% with apremilast (P<0.0001). In POETYK PSO-2 PASI 75 rates were 50.3% 34.3% and 8.6% at 16 weeks (P<0.0001) and 50.4% with deucravacitinib versus 29.5% with apremilast at week 24 (P<0.0001).

Armstrong said the safety profiles for deucravacitinib and apremilast were consistent with the drugs' mechanisms of action. Pooled data for the two trials showed that overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were similar across the three treatment arms as were rates of serious AEs. Rates of discontinuation because of AEs were 11.6% with apremilast 9.4% with placebo and 4.4% with deucravacitinib.

Nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection occurred in 23%-26% of patients and 12%-14% of patients across the treatment arms. Headache diarrhea and nausea occurred substantially more often with apremilast (26.0% 26.5% and 22.9%) than with deucravacitinib (8.5% 7.3% and 2.1%).

Deucravacitinib has potential for broad applicability in immune-mediated diseases according to Armstrong. Regulatory submission is pending for psoriasis phase III trials in psoriatic arthritis have begun and phase II trials in ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease and lupus are scheduled to begin later this year and in 2022.

But how often do those initial results translate into longer healthier lives for patients?

That seemingly simple question is one of the thorniest debates in medicine. It spills into public view Tuesday as the Food and Drug Administration convenes the first meeting in a decade to consider clawing back approvals from several cancer drugs that have failed to show they extend or improve life.

The agency says it has used innovative research shortcuts to speed up the availability of medicines for desperately ill patients. But many researchers say it has failed to crack down on medications that don’t deliver on their early promise leaving a glut of expensive unproven cancer drugs on the market.

“Doctors are using these drugs and patients are receiving them with all their toxicities and without knowing whether they actually doing anything” said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel a cancer specialist and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. “We should not be in a situation where we’re endlessly uncertain.”

The three-day meeting on drugs from Merck Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb is part of an industrywide review triggered by an “unprecedented level of drug development” in recent years according to FDA officials. The agency has only held similar meetings three times in its history the last one in 2011.

The U.S. spends more per person on prescription drugs than any other nation and spending on cancer drugs has more than doubled since 2013 to over $60 billion annually according to the data firm IQVIA. New medications typically cost $90000 to $300000 a year. And those prices have risen much faster than patient survival.

The FDA is prohibited from considering cost but it is supposed to keep ineffective drugs off the market.

“This is finally a referendum a small court where we can ask whether we are we better off for spending all this money” said Dr. Vinay Prasad a cancer specialist at University of California San Francisco and longtime critic of FDA’s approach. “And for many of these drugs the answer looks like ‘no.’”

The FDA will hear presentations from the drugmakers and seek advice from a panel of cancer experts. Agency leaders stated in a recent op-ed that the discussion is important because a failed study “does not necessarily mean that the drug is ineffective.”

FDA makes the final decision on whether to pull approvals but there are signs the agency may be ready for a tougher approach.

Since late last year four drugmakers have “voluntarily” pulled approvals for several types of lung and bladder cancers after “consulting” with FDA. Each drug had failed to extend survival after initially winning FDA approval based on measures like tumor shrinkage.

The removal of four cancer approvals in quick succession is unprecedented. Several former FDA directors said at a recent conference that it showed the agency’s so-called accelerated approval program is “healthy.”

But the sheer rarity of such withdrawals undercuts that view.

In 1992 Congress gave the FDA the ability to accelerate drug approvals based on preliminary study data responding to protests from HIV patients and activists over the slow pace of drug development. The program was embraced by the industry for giving many drugs a faster cheaper path to market.

As originally conceived these quicker approvals functioned like a contract: If the drugs weren’t shown to help patients live longer or better lives in follow-up studies the approvals would be revoked.

That’s rarely happened. Of 155 expedited cancer approvals 10 have been withdrawn almost always voluntarily by the manufacturer. The FDA has used its authority to revoke an accelerated cancer approval only once. That long ugly experience still looms large over the agency’s oversight of cancer drugs.

It took the FDA more than a year to finally pull the breast cancer approval from Roche’s blockbuster drug Avastin. The agency was besieged by calls from cancer patients and libertarian groups to keep the approval despite clear evidence that it didn’t extend life and caused dangerous side effects.

The drugs under review this week — Merck’s Keytruda Roche’s Tecentriq and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo — are part of a recent wave of “immunotherapies” that help the body’s defense system recognize and attack cancer. The blockbuster drugs have shown life-extending gains against deadly forms of skin and lung cancer among other conditions. But they’ve also racked up several dozen approvals in other indications including forms of bladder throat and liver cancer that are the focus of the meeting.

Studies by all three companies have shown negative or inconclusive results.

Even if all six uses under review are withdrawn the drugs will stay on the market because they are approved for so many other indications. And that may not change care much for patients. Dr. Shilpa Gupta of the Cleveland Clinic notes FDA approved five immunotherapy drugs for bladder cancer between 2016 and 2017 — including two under review.

“Did we really need all five of those drugs?” she asked.

Accelerated approval is technically reserved for drugs that fill an “unmet need.” But today roughly a third of all cancer drugs reach the market through the pathway including many drugs approved for overlapping uses.

After years of studies criticizing the FDA’s oversight of the program — including by government inspectors — agency scientists have begun pushing back.

In a 2018 study FDA staffers deemed the program a success noting only 5% of accelerated cancer approvals had ever been withdrawn and 55% had been “verified” by follow-up studies.

But when Harvard researchers dug into that claim they found that only about 20% of cancer drugs had actually been shown to extend lives. In most cases the FDA had allowed drugmakers to confirm their drugs’ worth by conducting a second study of a preliminary measure such as tumor shrinkage or delayed tumor growth.

In some cancers shrinking or slowing tumor growth is proven to benefit patients. But in many cases that link hasn’t been established.

“Having a smaller cancer that kills you rather than a bigger cancer is no consolation because you’re still dead” said Emanuel.

Residents who live near the intersection and by Grafton Street posted to Reddit Tuesday afternoon that their tap water had turned brown with some asking whether the water was safe to drink.

Thomas Matthews a spokesman for Worcester City Manager Eric Batista told MassLive the reason for the brown water was a 16-inch water main break at 725 Grafton St. that happened at 2 a.m. Tuesday. According to Matthews the water main break resulted in some nearby residents having rusty water giving it a brown color.

“Residents are advised that the water is not harmful and encouraged to run their cold water in a tub for about 10 minutes to help clear it up as crews work to make a repair” Matthews said.

The water main break closed both sides of Grafton Street at Valmor Street according to the Worcester Police Department. In a post on X the department advised drivers to find another route.

Matthews told MassLive that the pipe had been turned off since it was broken and repairs to the main were underway as of Tuesday afternoon.

According to a document created by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection the main reason for tap water having a brown yellow orange or red color is because of rust.

“Rusty water occurs from sediment in the pipes or rust from the inside walls of the water mains” the document reads. “The rust can be disturbed and temporarily suspended in water with unusual water flows from water main breaks or maintenance or by flushing of a hydrant.”

Even though the color of the water may look different the MassDEP states that having rusty water is not dangerous to drink compared to water filled with bacteria or lead.

Water main breaks in Worcester have happened before. On Feb. 4 2023 water from a broken pipe flooded into an apartment building on 425 Pleasant St. The owner of the apartment the Worcester Housing Authority said the flooding resulted in “catastrophic damage to the building’s electrical fire alarm and sprinkler systems.” Nearly 250 residents were evacuated from the building and found shelter in hotels during the three-month repair process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29va2luZy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS9yZWNpcGVzLzEwMjU0MDktYnJvd24tc3VnYXItc2hlZXQtcGFuLWZyZW5jaC10b2FzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Sugar Sheet-Pan French Toast Recipe,With a cracking caramelized brown sugar crust topping and soft custardy slices of challah this sheet-pan French toast is sweet perfection all by itself without the need for maple syrup or powdered sugar.

The slain teen who also took two bullets to the leg was a student at nearby Broome Street Academy Charter High School according to sources.

It wasn’t immediately clear if Brown was the intended target but sources said the gunfire may have erupted following a dispute between two groups of girls earlier that day.

No arrests have yet been made cops said.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting an injured Brown collapsed in an alley next to the Dominick Hotel horrified witnesses recalled.

“It was sickening” Justo Cruz a security guard who works in the area told The Post.

“He was just laid down looking unconscious. I saw some blood on the shirt but I didn’t look. Nothing nice. That was a human on the floor. That was movie-like.”

“No matter how nice a place is or stuff like that you always kind of have to be on high alert in a sense” Cruz added. “Soho — good vibes good energy very diverse. You don’t expect certain things in a nice area.”

Brown Dish on This Is Us Podcast (Exclusive),"Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are teaming up to launch a This Is Us rewatch podcast titled That Was Us.

PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the podcast's new trailer which teases what fans can expect when That Was Us officially makes its debut on Tuesday May 14.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

Hard Rock International the Seminole tribe has been kicking tires all over town for a casino acquisition.

They were reportedly close on Planet Hollywood but now we hear the tribe’s in advanced talks to purchase Bally’s on the Las Vegas Strip.

Hard Rock International bought back the rights to use the Hard Rock brand for a casino resort in Las Vegas from Juniper Capital in May 2020. (There’s a Hard Rock Cafe on The Strip but there’s no casino so it doesn’t count.)

Juniper purchased the Hard Rock casino in 2018 from Brookfield Asset Management.

There will be a quiz.

We’ve heard the Seminoles were pretty far down the path of buying Planet Hollywood but hit a snag related to the Zappos Theater. Namely Planet Hollywood’s owner Caesars Entertainment doesn’t want to give it up.

What would it mean if the Seminoles are buying Bally’s as we’re told they are?

Well it would lay waste to the theory Bally’s will be rebranded to Horseshoe. Caesars can’t rebrand something it doesn’t own.

We were curious why it was taking Caesars so long to do the rebrand given: 1) Caesars sold the Bally’s brand to Twin River now called Bally’s Corp. and 2) Bally’s Corp. recently purchased Tropicana and could very well rebrand it to Bally’s assuming there isn’t another one on The Strip.

The rumored sale of Bally’s to Hard Rock International helps explain the rebrand foot-dragging.

It’s worth noting Bally’s is nearly 50 years old (it was formerly MGM Grand). That’s about 1050 in Las Vegas resort years. What if Hard Rock demolished the place and built a big-ass guitar hotel on the site like the one in Florida?

Chatter about Las Vegas casino mergers and acquisitions is at an all-time high.

Caesars Entertainment has a huge debt load and company officials have publicly said they’ll sell one or more Las Vegas casinos.

Apparently there’s been a lot of interest in Cromwell but the company isn’t selling.

In somewhat related news confirmation of another sale of a major off-Strip resort is expected soon. We’ll share when we can share of course.

What we can say is a clear theme is emerging as neither buyer owns a casino in Las Vegas at the moment.

Until then lots of big announcements in the works and lots of new casino chips to collect. There are Circa chips (opened in late 2020) Mohegan Sun chips (at Virgin which opened recently) Resorts World chips (opening June 24 2021) and possibly Bally’s chips at Tropicana and Hard Rock chips at the former Bally’s.

The usual disclaimer applies: The rumor of a Bally’s sale to Hard Rock International is unconfirmed (nor will it be prior to an official announcement as Caesars Entertainment is a public company and won’t comment on rumors). We share industry chatter we think you’ll find of interest. Things change so don’t get your manties in a bunch if this particular rumor doesn’t pan out. We are a blog not a soothsayer. Probably.

Las Vegas is in a constant state of flux and we look forward to your being fluxed up here again soon.

Udpate (10/5/21): Things move fast in Las Vegas! The latest word is the Bally’s sale isn’t happening and the resort will be rebranded to Horseshoe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmF2ZWxwdWxzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3RlbHMtYW5kLXJlc29ydHMvaGFycmFocy1yZXNvcnQtYXRsYW50aWMtY2l0eS10by1vcGVuLWZpdmUtbmV3LWRpbmluZy1uaWdodGxpZmUtc3BhLWNvbmNlcHRzLXRoaXMtc3ByaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harrah's Resort Atlantic City To Open Five New Dining Nightlife & Spa Concepts This Spring,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/hotels-and-resorts/harrahs-resort-atlantic-city-to-open-five-new-dining-nightlife-spa-concepts-this-spring on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmF2ZWxwdWxzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3RlbHMtYW5kLXJlc29ydHMvaGFycmFocy1yZXNvcnQtYXRsYW50aWMtY2l0eS10by1vcGVuLWZpdmUtbmV3LWRpbmluZy1uaWdodGxpZmUtc3BhLWNvbmNlcHRzLXRoaXMtc3ByaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbHR5bmV3c3JlcG9ydC5jb20vZmF0LWJvb3RzLXRyYWlsZXItcGFyay1iYXItb3BlbmluZy1vbi13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWF2ZW51ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fat Boots Trailer Park Bar Opening on Washington Avenue,"HOUSTON – (Realty News Report) – Fat Boots Trailer Park Bar – a “drinkertainment” concept being primed for national expansion – is rolling out on Houston’s Washington Avenue.

The experiential concept developed by Las Vegas entertainment veterans Jennifer Worthington Robert Frey and Ned Collett “playfully brings to life vintage trailer park culture” in an immersive indoor/outdoor space the organizers said.

Located at 4218 Washington Avenue Fat Boots Trailer Park Bar encompasses 2000 square feet of indoor space along with 800 square feet of patio. Steve Merritt of Transworld Business Advisors represented the tenant and Eva Hughes represented the landlord.

Additional Fat Boot Trailer Park Bars are under development in New Orleans and Nashville.

Located at 4218 Washington Avenue Fat Boot’s Trailer Park Bar encompasses 2000 square feet of indoor space along with 800 square feet of patio. Steve Merritt of Transworld Business Advisors represented the tenant and Eva Hughes represented the landlord.

Cocktails in Spam Cans

Fat Boots staff will not only perform but also encourage patrons to get into the act with call outs dancing on the stage/bar to a set list of 80s/90s/2000s favorites and anthems drinking games and more. The beverage menu will include an array of signature cocktails some festooned and served in Spam and SpaghettiOs cans along with a deep dive of beers and Jell-O shots. The bar will also be stocked with a selection of trailer park classics ranging from Twinkies to Cheez Whiz and crackers.

“We love the carefree attitude and diversity of Houston buoying the reasons for launching the Fat Boot’s brand here. And how could we not jump on an Inner Loop site halfway between The Beer Can House and Art Car Museum – two landmarks that epitomize the creative fun-loving vibe of the city.” said partner Robert Frey the founding partner of the Las Vegas-based PURE Nightclub plus the Pussy Cat Dolls Lounge at Caesars Palace and Social House at Treasure Island.

“The Evolution of Bars”

Partner Jennifer Worthington a multi-faceted entrepreneur who was the youngest senior vice president at Jerry Bruckheimer Films in Los Angeles before entering the hospitality space in New York and Las Vegas with acclaimed haunts like Coyote Ugly at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino adds “Fat Boots speaks to the evolution of bars as immersive spaces where staff become entertainers and cogs for social interaction and guests become part of theater.”

Rolling Stones Experience

Houston-based Ned Collett is the final cog in the ownership trifecta and brings decades of live entertainment experience. He has produced high profile events like the Spring Awakening Music Festival and The Rolling Stones at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The team engaged the talents of Houston artist Caitlin Caselli plus set veteran Abigail Kehr who regularly works with the Houston Grand Opera Houston Ballet and Houston Symphony to bring the vintage trailer park vision to life with interactive vignettes games and selfie scenes. Kehr has curated a series of interior “yards” for groups festooned with classic signage and thematic props. And out back on the Astroturf patio a rainbow of Adirondack circle kiddie pools equipped with toy fishing gear – perfect for killin’ a little time while waiting for friends to arrive.

The bar located on Washington Avenue between Heights Blvd. and Shepherd Drive is expected to open May 5.

To learn more about Soup and Sandwich a 3-year-old thoroughbred ranked 14th in the Kentucky Derby points standings with 40 points you have to add another word or two like Soup and Sandwich horse or Soup and Sandwich Kentucky Derby.

Owner Charlotte Colket Weber of Live Oak Plantation understands that. But if Soup and Sandwich overcomes the 30-1 odds and wins the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 1 local cafes just might take a back seat to the 3-year-old thoroughbred the next time you search for soup and sandwich on Google.

“We all go through the serious names and picking a name is really not an easy job” Weber said. “It’s very challenging. I was thinking is that stupid and stupid stuck. And now stupid is good. Just took a shot. Thought it was fun and a little mischief.”

Weber the granddaughter of Campbell Soup founder John T. Dorrance and a board trustee of Campbell Soup Company has been incorporating the name “Soup” for a while now which has helped people identify her horses. For instance she has a 3-year-old filly Souper Sensational hoping to compete in the Kentucky Oaks.

She even had a car license plate with “SOUPER” and was once asked about it by a police officer who thought Weber had misspelled the word.

“It’s cute. It’s catchy” Weber said. “When they see it they’ll remember it.”

It’s not just the name that’s been garnering attention. Soup and Sandwich isn’t lacking any momentum on the track too as he came to prominence after finishing runner-up in the Florida Derby last month. He also finished first at Tampa Bay Downs in February and at Gulfstream Park in January.

Considering Soup and Sandwich didn’t race as a 2-year-old the scene is set for him to make an even bigger splash on May 1.

“I was almost happy he didn’t win the Florida Derby because I think he does have a lot of raw talent” she said. “I don’t want to get ahead of myself. People feel if I get this that puts icing on the cake. I’d rather have the cake with less icing and look forward to building a stronger cake.”

Weber is hoping for a splash too as he is the fifth thoroughbred to qualify for the Kentucky Derby from Live Oak Plantation. The first four are Laser Light (1982) High Fly (2005) Brilliant Speed (2011) and Win Win Win (2019).

Having heard only good news from trainer Mark Casse and jockey Tyler Gaffalione who are all seeking their first top finish at the Kentucky Derby during training Weber is optimistic.

“Everybody’s very comfortable and very confident and very excited” she said. “I think we’ll have a good fanbase.”

But she was quick to note that having a week before the Run for the Roses isn’t a short time at all. Soup and Sandwich may not have the best odds but what may happen between now and May 1 and on the Kentucky Derby is up in the air. And she wants people to remember her horse for his performance not just as a catchy name.

“It’s a very long time in a life of a racehorse when you’re hoping to go to the post” she said. “There’s a lot of anxiety a lot of excitement. We’ve been living a whole year of uncertainty. It’s hard to be so optimistic that you’re not realistic.”

As the countdown to kickoff wound down children jumped around while climbing along the bleachers and leaving concession stands grasping chicken fingers soft pretzels and hot dogs.

Since 2001 the football team plays its Spring Game on Maryland Day that has become a tradition that connects the team with the community.

After a year without the annual scrimmage due to the coronavirus pandemic being at this year’s game meant even more to many fans especially some younger ones.

For nine-year-old Zoey and six-year-old Zaiya Brooks coming to Maryland Day means cheering on the football team playing lots of fun games and supporting their father Maryland running backs coach Elijah Brooks.

“I love coming to see my dad and playing the games [on Maryland Day]” Zoey said.

Although her mother describes her as a “daddy’s girl” Zoey decided ahead of the game that she would be cheering for both teams even if her father coached the Red team.

Another thing Zoey is happy about this year is just enjoying the time outside with her family. With school being virtual this year the time away from the screens on campus feels even more valuable.

“It feels great to be here” Zoey said. “I’m excited to get the fresh air.”

For other young fans like eight-year-old Morgan and her five-year-old brother Adrian this Maryland Day is their first at the Spring Game but that doesn’t mean they were not excited to be in the stadium.

“It feels good to be here. I’m excited to watch the football” Morgan said ahead of the game.

Although neither Morgan nor her brother came into the stadium with a particular team in mind they hoped to cheer for when they arrived that quickly changed.

“I like the white team because that’s my favorite color” Adrian said.

Morgan on the other hand elected to cheer for red. However the siblings said they were just excited to watch the Terps play in person with their parents.

Similar to Morgan and Adrian the Giove family was excited to cheer on the Terps in person together.

Hailing from Damascus Maryland the Gioves make the one-hour trip every spring to make it to this event and describe it as part of their family tradition.

Sporting their best Maryland gear including a football jersey signed by Testudo the Giove’s were happy to be supporting the Terps in person after a year spent in front of the television.

Joseph Giove’s two oldest boys 10-year-old Joey and seven-year-old Jack both said it “feels awesome” to be back at Capital One after such a long time away.

“It feels awesome to be back since I couldn’t be here last year” Jack said. “Feels like a long time.”

“And it’s a tradition” Joey added enthusiastically.

However a trip to the Spring Game is not complete without their eight-year-old sister Lucy.

Wearing her Maryland cheerleader uniform Lucy was relieved to be back at Capital One with her brothers and father.

Although she finds it challenging to wear a mask throughout the entirety of the game she thinks it’s worth it if it means seeing the Terps play in person especially after a long year.

“Watching on tv just isn’t enough for me” Lucy said. “I know I have to wear a mask but it’s good to be back.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWRvbWVzdGljLXdpZGUtYm9keS1zdW1tZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta just upgraded 23 domestic routes with wide-body jets,"A handful of Delta flyers are in for a nice surprise this summer.

Over the weekend the Atlanta-based carrier upgauged a slew of domestic routes with wide-body jets marking the ultimate upgrade for premium-cabin passengers. These planes usually fly Delta's longest international jaunts so they're outfitted with lie-flat seats in biz and some even sport a premium economy cabin too.

With most countries closed for the foreseeable future the carrier would seemingly prefer flying its widebodies on select domestic flights instead of parking them in the desert.

Of course Delta's schedule could still change especially as more international destinations begin reopening to Americans but in the meantime here's the latest update on where you'll find Delta wide-body jets on domestic flights per Cirium schedules.

Stay up-to-date on airline and aviation news by signing up for our brand-new aviation newsletter.

The flagship will hop the coasts

Delta's flagship jet the Airbus A350 provides perhaps the best inflight experience of all the U.S. carriers.

For June and July you'll find it flying daily between Atlanta (ATL) and Los Angeles (LAX). Note that this is your only opportunity to fly Delta's posh jet domestically — Cirium schedules show that it's slated to be deployed almost exclusively on international jaunts this summer.

Delta's 306-seat A350 is outfitted with 32 Delta One Suites 48 Premium Select recliners and 226 coach seats. Some also sport a Comfort+ cabin. The biz suites feature sliding doors for added privacy making it one of the top hard products offered by the Big 3.

Coupled with Delta's new inflight service I'm adding this route to my summer bucket list.

Hawaii gets larger jets and a surprise

Hawaii has reopened to tourists once again. The island state requires a pre-travel COVID-19 test though there are reports that a vaccination certificate will soon replace the testing requirement.

Demand for travel to Hawaii is seemingly at pandemic-era highs. Flights are going out full airlines are adding new routes and some carriers like Delta are even boosting their existing frequencies.

The most notable upgrade will be found on Delta's Seattle (SEA) to Honolulu (HNL) route. Between June 5 and July 6 the carrier will fly its latest jet the Airbus A330-900neo on one daily frequency marking the first time the plane has even flown to Hawaii per Cirium schedules.

If you're looking for the most luxurious commercial option to the Aloha state this is likely it — be sure to book Flight 444 or 1628 on the outbound and Flight 705 or 2239 on the return.

Note however that schedules are still subject to change. Last week Delta filed the A330neo on the New York-JFK to Seattle (SEA) route between June 5 through Sept. 6. This week the carrier trimmed that window to start on July 8 and placed the jet on the SEA to Honolulu flight instead. Fingers crossed the updated schedule sticks.

Delta's also upgauging three other Hawaii routes with larger wide-body jets on the following routes:

Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) — Honolulu (HNL)

Salt Lake City (SLC) — Honolulu (HNL)

Salt Lake City (SLC) — Maui (OGG)

Specifically the carrier is deploying the Airbus A330-200 and A330-300 instead of the Boeing 767 on many frequencies in June and July on the aforementioned routes. The Airbus planes aren't just larger — they also sport a much improved reverse herringbone biz product compared to the forward-facing Thompson Vantage biz on the 767s.

If faced with the choice I'd recommend choosing an A330 over Delta's 767-300.

Leisure rules the recovery

Whether it's national parks or theme parks Denver Las Vegas and Orlando are three cities with plenty of activities nearby. As leisure travel recovers fastest airlines have been quick to add flights and boost existing routes to these destinations.

The latest move comes from Delta.

The carrier is upgrading two routes to Denver (DEN) one from Atlanta (ATL) and another from New York-JFK. The former will see a mix of the Boeing 767-300 and 767-400 on two daily frequencies in June and July. Between June 5 and July 6 the carrier will upgrade the latter with one daily Boeing 767-400 flight.

Las Vegas (LAS) has been a popular airport for wide-body jets operating domestic flights. Just this week American Airlines added a second daily Boeing 777 frequency between Miami (MIA) and LAS.

For its part Delta will fly at least three daily Boeing 767 flights between Atlanta (ATL) and LAS in June and at least two daily flights in July.

For those planning a trip to visit Mickey Mouse Delta's Orlando (MCO) service is getting a boost as follows:

Atlanta (ATL) — Orlando (MCO): at least one daily flight will be operated by a Boeing 767 in June and July.

Salt Lake City (SLC) — Orlando (MCO): one daily Airbus A330-200 flight from June 5 to July 6 switching to a Boeing 767-300 on July 7.

Delta's Boeing 767 fleet is split between the -300 and -400 variant. The former sports Delta's most lackluster and outdated biz.

You'll want to snag a seat on the -400 if you can. The overwhelming majority of the 767-400s have been recently retrofitted with a modified version of Delta One Suites with added privacy and personal space minus the sliding door.

The remainder is mostly hub-to-hub

Before the pandemic Delta primarily deployed wide-body jets on domestic hub-to-hub flights during downtime either as repositioning segments or for maintenance.

It's no surprise then that most of the remaining routes getting upgraded include service between hubs. You'll find the full list of changes from the latest schedule update below per Cirium timetables.

Once again be sure to note that everything is subject to change due to the pandemic — always check the aircraft type when you're making or modifying a reservation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL25vdmFjYXBzZmFucy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8yNC9hbGV4LW92ZWNoa2luLWRpZC1ub3QtcGFydGljaXBhdGUtaW4tbW9ybmluZy1za2F0ZS1sYXZpb2xldHRlLXdvdWxkLW5vdC1jb25maXJtLWlmLWhlLXdpbGwtcGxheS10b25pZ2h0L9IBkAFodHRwczovL25vdmFjYXBzZmFucy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8yNC9hbGV4LW92ZWNoa2luLWRpZC1ub3QtcGFydGljaXBhdGUtaW4tbW9ybmluZy1za2F0ZS1sYXZpb2xldHRlLXdvdWxkLW5vdC1jb25maXJtLWlmLWhlLXdpbGwtcGxheS10b25pZ2h0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Ovechkin Did Not Participate In Morning Skate Laviolette Would Not Confirm If He Will Play Tonight,"Washington Capitals head coach Peter Laviolette told media following the team’s morning skate on Saturday that the team is working through some things in the room and would not confirm if Alex Ovechkin will or will not play tonight.

Laviolette says the team is working through some things in the room would not confirm if Alex Ovechkin is in or out tonight. #ALLCAPS — NoVa Caps (@NoVa_Caps) April 24 2021

Ovechkin was listed “day-to-day” on Friday with a lower body injury that he sustained in the third period of the Capitals first game with the Islanders on Thursday. He appeared to pull up (right leg) as he rushed the puck through the neutral zone with 2:49 remaining in regulation.

Ovechkin ultimately did not skate in the overtime period but remained on the bench. He did not participate in the Capitals’ optional practice on Friday.

Ovechkin has missed just 35 games in 16 seasons. 17 of those absences haves been injury related. The other 18 absences were due to suspension personal reasons COVID etc.

The Capitals face the Islanders in the second game of their three-game set Saturday night at Nassau Coliseum in New York. The two teams will return to the District for their regular season-series finale at Capital One Arena on Tuesday.

Zdeno Chara took to Instagram on Sunday to reflect on playing in his 1600th NHL game.

Chara became the 13th player of all time and the fifth defenseman to ever reach the mark. The Capitals saluted Chara with a tribute video on social media. After the game Nicklas Backstrom gave Zee the milestone game puck while Nick Jensen and Michael Raffl gave the towering rearguard both of the Cobra Kai headbands for player of the game.

“Last night was a special night” Chara wrote on in Instagram page.

“Not just because of the milestone but everyone who was part of it.

“I am blessed and lucky to still be playing this game but I wouldn’t still be here without the love and support from my wife Tatiana and 3 beautiful children Elliz Ben & Zack. I love you!

“Playing this game is a privilege and I am honored to be part of the @capitals team with such a classy Owner Management Coaching and Training staff. And of course I’m so grateful for all of my teammates who I care about so deeply.

“Seeing everyone rally around “1600” for me was very special. We build relationships and that’s what makes a great team that’s what makes a brotherhood.

“Thank you so much guys it was a meaningful night.

“And of course thank you fans. We’re looking forward to hearing your support from the stands at Capital One arena!”

In the comments of his post Chara received congratulations from across the NHL including PK Subban Jakub Kindl and Sheldon Souray. Capitals teammate Carl Hagelin also dropped two champagne bottle emoji. Chara replied in Swedish saying “skol kompis.” It means “cheers friend.”

We might have also left a congratulatory note for Zee too.

😊😢

The three top vote-getters will advance to the Nov. 2 general election where they will face three Democratic Party candidates for the three at-large seats to be decided.

The Republican hopefuls are current Ward 3 councilman Jonathon Bollas former Tallmadge Parks & Recreation assistant superintendent Adam Bozic community member Rita Detorakis and current councilman at-large Dennis Loughry.

Only three Democrats - current councilman at-large James Donovan current appointed councilman at-large Christopher Grimm and current Ward 4 councilwoman and council president Carol Siciliano-Kilway - filed to run for the trio of seats and so there will not be a Democratic primary. The three automatically will appear on the November ballot.

The at-large four-year terms will begin Jan. 1 2022.

Jonathon Bollas

Bollas 37 is currently serving his first term as the Ward 3 councilman but is seeking an at-large seat to offer broader representation.

""It's about growth and development. I want to have the opportunity to help the entire city. I've really enjoyed serving the community I feel like I'm connecting with residents of Ward 3 hearing their concerns and getting a grasp on how I can best serve them"" he said.

Bollas's Ward 3 term does not expire until the end of 2023. If he wins the at-large seat he would vacate the Ward 3 seat which would then be filled by the local Republican precinct. Should he lose he would retain his Ward 3 seat law director Megan Raber said.

Bollas received his bachelor's in business management from Kent State University and his master's of business administration from Malone University. He currently works as an information technology project manager for Cardinal Health and is also a member of the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church and a club member of Toastmasters International.

On council he serves as chair of the safety committee vice chair of community issues committee and as a member of the personnel committee.

Bollas who was first elected in 2019 said that his greatest accomplishments as Ward 3 councilman were working through the COVID-19 pandemic and working with council to make progress on Fire Station 2 the East Avenue widening project and purchasing a new fire truck. He also has worked with Ward 3 residents to alleviate their flooding concerns.

""I try to do what I can to respond in a timely manner to residents and just be there listening and trying to get creative to come up with a solution"" he said.

Ward 3 generally does not face issues related to commercial zoning or parks and recreation so Bollas said he hopes to be a larger part of those discussions as an at-large councilman.

Adam Bozic

Bozic 37 is a 2002 Tallmadge High School graduate who has lived in the city for about 30 years.

Immediately following high school he joined the Marine Corps serving until 2007. He earned a bachelor's degree in education with a focus on sports management and a master's in sports administration both from the University of Akron.

This year he started a flooring specialty company called Classic Shine which is located in Tallmadge. His wife Julie is also the owner of Harmonize Studios in Tallmadge a studio space for private music lessons.

From December 2014 to February 2021 he served as Tallmadge's Parks and Recreation assistant superintendent. Bozic resigned in order to run for council as civil service employees are not permitted to run for public office in Tallmadge.

""It's always been something I wanted to do. I want to give back to the community to be able to make improvements to our community"" he said.

As a councilman Bozic would like to see more investment in the parks including playground resurfacing and addressing safety concerns and ensuring that the safety forces have the proper equipment and buildings that they need.

""These things aren't necessarily lacking but I think we can always do more"" he said.

At the parks for example Bozic would like to see an immediate investment because ""it shouldn't be on a five-year-plan it should be done right away.""

Rita Detorakis

Detorakis did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Dennis Loughry

Loughry 63 is the only Republican incumbent for the at-large seat.

He was first elected to city council in 1994 and again in 1998 and also served on the Civil Service Commission under then-Mayor Chris Grimm and on the Tallmadge Schools Board of Education. Loughry also served as service director and economic developer under Mayor David Kline and as the executive director of the Tallmadge Chamber of Commerce.

He is currently director of business development for FMD Architects and on council serves as chair of community issues vice chair of public service and as a member of planning and zoning. He is also a member and past president of Rotary International a trustee of Tallmadge Foundation and past president of Downtown Akron Kiwanis.

Loughry returned to council in 2018 when he ran as an Independent but returned to the Republican party mid-term.

Loughry said he ran as an Independent to make a point that he believed in nonpartisanship. Tallmadge is a partisan city and Loughry has expressed his desire for the city to become nonpartisan at the last three Charter Review Commissions. No commission has moved forward with his suggestions.

Loughry noted that he has also previously voted as a Democrat in order to support a friend who was seeking a council seat and running as a Democrat.

""When you're an [Independent] people feel like they don't know you or what you think or how you think or what you stand in because they can't associate you to a party. Some would say I'm either a very moderate Republican or a very very conservative Democrat. I think [running as a Republican] would make it easier for voters to know where I stood at least on national issues"" he said.

Loughry said he approaches issues from a conservative perspective but that because of his professional background he is also able to see issues from both a legislative and administrative perspective.

In the next term Loughry plans to focus on safety first service second and recreation third always with a mind toward the city's financial position.

That’s according to court documents filed in Harris County Texas Criminal Court. Nina Amber Howell 35 who also goes by Nina Howell Allemant was arrested Thursday night on accusations she stole an SUV from a car dealership after pretending she was taking the vehicle for a test drive. She’s then accused of vandalizing car dealership property.

According to the charging documents Howell on March 9 test drove an orange 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander worth approximately $30000 from a Carmax location in Cypress Texas and never returned the vehicle. Because Howell provided the dealership with a copy of her driver’s license and phone number officers with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office (HCSO) were able to quickly confirm her identity. When an officer called Howell to ask her about the vehicle “she denied it” and told the officer to “stop calling her.”

When police searched Howell’s Twitter account they noted that she had twice tweeted about Carmax on that same date — March 9.

The first tweet appeared to be a GIF of a mongoose growling that was captioned “Testing testing testing testing…@Carmax.”

The second actually specified the Cypress Carmax location with a picture of a computer screen with two dropdown menus for “Application” and “Location.” Under the former the word “MARS” was selected and under the latter “CARMAX – CYPRESS FAIR” was selected. The tweet was captioned: “The fffffuck @Spacex @MAVEN2Mars @BoredElonMusk – even at Carmax? EW.”

Howell also posted several videos to her Twitter account that appear to be evidence of alleged criminal mischief. Court documents state that Howell on or about April 21 damaged “tangible property namely two motor vehicles owned by Brad Stapp” by “marking the motor vehicles with a permanent marker.”

On April 22 at 4:18 a.m. Howell posted a picture of a white Ford Mustang at a Planet Ford dealership that had been vandalized with writing in black marker on the front hood. (Brad Stapp may be the Operations Director at the Planet Ford in Houston.) The While most of the text is not legible due to the angle of the picture the message ends with the words “Fuck you!” then a drawing of a heart and the word “Moms” as if to read “Love Moms.” Howell is a mother of two.

She also posted a video of herself sitting inside of a vehicle filming the Planet Ford dealership from about a block away and narrating her alleged plans.

“So I drove up here. My intentions were to destroy the planet. That one right there” she said while focusing the camera on the large globe in front of the dealership.

When police caught up with her later in the day she led officers on a protracted high-speed chase according to a summary of her bail hearing from Friday. A magistrate judge said there was “clear and convincing evidence” that Howell was indigent and could not afford to pay any amount for bail but also reasoned that she presented too great a risk to be released.

“This D vandalizes a car dealership then leads officers on a 90-120 mph chase that lasted 77 miles in a stolen car” a magistrate judge wrote. Officers had to deploy both stop sticks and a PIT maneuver to disable D’s vehicle. D refused to comply with any officer’s commands. Refused to provide PTS with any info. D had continual outbursts during court. D refused to comply with this court’s orders. This behavior poses an ongoing threat to community safety. D’s unwillingness to comply indicates that D is a likely flight risk and is likely to continue to engage in behavior that will lead to her arrest.”

The defendant is charged with criminal mischief (for allegedly writing on the vehicle) felony theft (for allegedly stealing the other vehicle) and evading arrest or detention with a motor vehicle (for the police chase). According to court records the police noted the defendant also appeared to be upset about a family law situation as evidenced by a tweet they uncovered which showed court papers in the matter.

Videos obtained by a private investigator and subsequently shared with Houston NBC affiliate KPRC-TV suggested the defendant had an “unknown vendetta” against some of the the businesses she targeted a Friday evening television report indicated.

The cruise line initially pushed the launch back to Feb. 6 2021 however the ship equipped with a roller coaster will now set sail on April 24 2021 Carnival announced Thursday. It was originally scheduled to sail in November.

""We continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global commerce public health and our cruise operations"" President of Carnival Cruise Line Christine Duffy said in a statement at the time of the first delay. “In addition to our current pause in service there have been many other unintended consequences including shipyard dry dock and ship delivery delays and related changes to our deployment plans for our fleet.”

""While we had hoped to make up construction time on Mardi Gras over the summer it's clear we will need extra time to complete this magnificent ship” Duffy added. “We share our guests' disappointment and appreciate their patience as we work through this unprecedented time in our business and the lives of so many people. We remain committed to working with government public health and industry officials to support the response to the pandemic and to return to operations when the time is right.""

Additionally the company’s Carnival Radiance ship which was undergoing a renovation and has been dry docked in Spain has been delayed and will now likely not be completed until the spring. As a result the Carnival Breeze will take over itineraries originally meant for the Radiance from November through April. Eighteen sailings on the Breeze from Fort Lauderdale through March 2021 have been canceled.

1. Philadelphia April 2062: A Premonitory Review of ‘Carnival of Ruin’

I just teleported myself back to my South Philly apartment from West Chester University where I saw an exhibition titled Carnival of Ruin created by Constance Case Gretchen Studlien-Webb and Maria Urrutia three youthful faculty members in the Dance and Theatre Department.

The gallery exhibited a dazzling array of costumes and props made of 40-year old materials — post-consumer waste from grocery plastic bags and straws to large drinking water containers and bottle caps. The hand-made costumes are part of a larger production an outdoor site-specific performance scheduled for the month of May.

The costumes are designed to fit several actors who will perform a farcical burlesque phantasmagorical fable about sustainability and preservation.

The gallery experience caused me to reminisce about “ruin” and about the 40-year old materials and goods that in part caused it. Younger readers might have a harder time to relate but Philadelphia used to be a city of brick row homes with an exceptional collection of Colonial Federal and Victorian houses and buildings. In 2015 UNESCO recognized Philadelphia as a world heritage city partly because of its unique and historic architecture.

Gazing toward the North/East through the window of my 162nd floor apartment building I clearly see Front street (6th street until the late 2020s) and the banks of the wide Delaware River.

The view from my window is a clear reminder of the catastrophic and irreversible impact that global warming and the rise of sea levels have had on Philadelphia on both coasts of the US and the rest of the world. A giant historical marker bobbing above the surface of the water now marks the location where once stood Gloria Dei (or Olde Swedes’) Church the oldest building in town completed in 1700.

The Society Hill Towers used to have 32 floors. Luckily developers have been able to add 63 floors that amply compensated for the 13 lowest original floors which are now under water. Luckily technology has made possible the consolidation and resuscitation of existing skyscrapers made of reinforced concrete now in flooded areas. New York City which survived is now called the Venice of North America in remembrance of the lost city of Venice Italy.

Older Philadelphians might remember taking visitors to see the Liberty Bell at the corner of 6th and Market streets. It still feels odd to see the bell on display inside Lemon Hill Mansion in East Fairmount Park. But we are all grateful for the technical prowess of the US Army Corps of Engineers for also moving to higher grounds the cherished symbols of our country: Independence Hall and Carpenters’ Hall now sitting next to the Please Touch Museum in West Fairmount Park.

Pulling myself out of my reveries I will tell you happily that the three West Chester University Faculty members confessed how challenging and how long it took to find enough plastic material to proceed with their project which they undertook as a cautionary tale about taking your environment for granted. Again younger readers might need a refresher. Plastic used to be a way of life an indispensable commodity for more than half a century. The profusion of plastic bags barely altered in the exhibit made me think of how much just a few decades ago plastic conditioned our daily life. Plastic was part of the daily landscape. It littered sidewalks. Public trash cans often overflowing with plastic containers were found everywhere. Shreds of plastic ripped apart by mechanical vehicles that adults drove themselves were commonly seen hanging from trees adjacent to highways and or along train tracks.

Our creation of plastics which are petrochemical byproducts and our excessive reliance on fossil fuel products caused great — and lasting — toxicity to earth’s air.

Think about our dependence on nutritive oxygen constantly pumped into our indoor environment and ATAV (Air Travel Automated Vehicles). We cannot live without them. Incidentally the United States was the first country to outlaw plastic in 2031 under the Harris administration followed by a worldwide ban in 2035.

One piece in the exhibition “Target Lady” immediately triggered nostalgia in me. Target Lady is a cabaret outfit/character. The skirt is made with dozens of fluffed up Target store plastic bags. Target was a well-known national retail chain in the first decades of the 21st century. Back then its white and red logo resembling an old fashioned archery target was emblematic of consumer culture. The bustier is made of plastic vertical red Collins straws. I thought the straws had been simply glued but Constance Case whose expertise is in costume design was quick to point out that they have been painstakingly stitched together. Plastic straws were ubiquitous with drinks. In the 2010s you could hardly order a beverage out without getting a straw.

Carnival of Ruin is a time capsule of the kind of past that we would like to forget and perhaps have forgotten although its consequences have forever impacted us. Under a technicolor whimsical veneer hides the shocking truth about a society addicted to fossil fuels and for far too long in denial of its irreversible ravages.

2. Philadelphia April 2021: A Real Review of ‘Carnival of Ruin’

My one-hour commute from Center City to West Chester University was in retrospect a premonition of the exhibition that I was about to see in the art gallery there. The journey was a visual catalogue of plastics’ pollution embedded in the entrenched economic social and racial disparities faced by this country. From Center City streets lined with shops and imposing office buildings through rundown neighborhoods and into the bucolic landscape along parts of West Chester Pike; finally to quaint downtown West Chester it was clear who were the communities most impacted by pollution in particular pollution caused by plastic bags.

The gallery showcased the performers’ costumes (more than a dozen) and the stage props such as a large circus-like tent all entirely made of post-consumer waste.

An impressive quantity of plastic shopping bags but also bottle openers pull tabs and fabric — some donated (like men’s ties) — make up the raw material for these costumes. Some materials seem to require little transformation and are therefore immediately recognizable.

This is the case with “Target Girl” whose skirt is made from bags from the namesake big box store or “Sippy the Snake’s” coat composed of dozens of cascading men’s ties. This last coat could literally be cut for a fashion collection except for the fact I was told that it weighs a lot and is quite challenging to wear.

The virtuoso-crocheted ceiling of the large circus tent is another technical tour de force. It is entirely made of crocheted plastic bags. For that 2500 bags were cut into strips. The strips were then attached together to create long plastic strings and then crocheted.

Creative craftmanship is on display everywhere. Time is not of the essence as each piece required long hours of repetitive and perhaps meditative manual labor. We learn for instance that the crocheted roof required 160 human hours.

The arduous and long process needed to achieve this variety of costumes and props is not evident at first sight. The vibrant colors and overall playfulness of the costumes are deceptive. Exhibition labels as well as photographs and videos posted online reveal however the scope of the laborious project which started more than four years ago and required an unflinching collaboration from the three professors undoubtedly put to test this past year by Covid restrictions.

Besides describing the materials used and how they were processed exhibition labels also reveal the core social and environmental message of the project: to bring awareness to the unstainable amount of trash our consumerist society produces and its impact on the environment.

The symbolic meaning of the characters that belong to these costumes clearly lays out the environmental challenges faced by the planet. Each character embodies a concept or rather a facet of the uncontrollable tragedy that has been unfolding for a few decades.

Each character description also comes with a simple tip a practical easy action to remember and implement. For “The Mermaid” who personifies the death of the ocean the tip reads “Use aluminum cans whenever possible as aluminum is the most valuable recyclable metal.”

Not all characters are villains. A couple of them exhibit traits of hope or resilience in the face of the destructive consumerist society. “Queen Bee” and “The Attendants” for example reflect the positive action that communities are capable of implementing when change is necessary.

I was curious to know how the world of performing arts had been impacted by the issues raised by the exhibition. Gretchen Studlien-Webb mentioned the example of workout clothes worn daily by dancers. Toxic chemicals linked to cancer have been found in sportswear manufactured by well-known brands. Studien-Webb learned it the hard way herself after designing a dress out of VHS videotape and discovering that the toxic metal on its surface is harmful when it starts to disintegrate. It is for this reason that VHS tapes cannot just be dumped into landfills.

The Carnival of Ruin show’s environmentally conscious message coincides with Philadelphia’s long-awaited ban in the Fall on the approximately one billion plastic bags used each year in the city. An information campaign on the ban will start this summer but the city will only start to fully enforce the law in Spring 2022. Philadelphia is far behind other major cities on passing a ban on disposable bags. The successful attempts to delay the ban by the state legislature are a somber reminder that it might take years for Pennsylvania to join California Delaware Hawaii New York and Oregon on banning the distribution of plastic bags.

It should be said that the message of Carnival of Ruin never feels moralizing. The intriguing craftsmanship vivid outfits and jovial characters confer on the show its overall carnivalesque liveliness and playfulness.

Next Carnival of Ruin is going on tour. An outdoor performance is scheduled May 29th in East Goshen Township Park in West Chester PA. Then the experience will be complete. Actors will be performing in nature as the show was intended in the very nature that the costumes’ material harm degrade and pollute. And if you wonder what will happen to the material. Most of it can be upcycled. Pieces will be donated to ECO Plastics Products of Delaware partners of Carnival of Ruin a non-profit company that specializes in recycling plastic to make consumer goods such as benches tables and fences. https://www.ecoplasticproducts.org/

This Carnival has been posted online by IAAI and has just 1005 miles on the clock. Most of the damage has been sustained to the rear of the vehicle suggesting that it was rear-ended at relatively high-speed.

The listing says the estimated repair costs to return the Carnival back to its former state will be $17852. With that in mind we don’t actually expect someone to purchase it with the intention of fixing it up and trying to sell it for a profit. Instead it seems far more likely that someone will buy it with the intention of parting out and selling some of its key components.

The incident the Carnival was involved in has left the rear fascia and bumper caved in and blown out the rear window. It seems likely that some damage was also done to the rear crash structure of the Kia hence why it would be so expensive to repair.

IAAI notes that the Carnival stills runs and drives indicating that the 3.5-liter GDI V6 engine and eight-speed automatic transmission are still in good working order and could be easily removed and sold.

SUMTER S.C. — For the first time in decades the Sumter American Legion will be hosting a spring event bringing the carnival to town.

“This will be everything they normally see at a carnival” Peter St. Onge with the American Legion said “rides food games. Great thing about this is there will not be a gate admittance like you see at the fair. So it’ll be free to enter.”

While attractions will cost a fee St. Onge said there will be plenty to choose from.

“They have a ride called chaos which is a multi-rotational ride and they also have a 110-foot-tall free fall tower that will be coming” St. Onge said. “So there’s plenty of action for the teenagers and there’s still plenty of the family friendly kiddie rides that’ll be out there.”

According to St. Onge the event will run from May 6th -May 16th. Safety guidance will be in place.

“Amusements of America will be running the operation. They have been following DHEC and CDC protocols” St. Onge said. “They’ve been open in several states so far.”"

ISTANBUL-Anadolu Agency

Turkey's flag carrier Turkish Airlines has become the leader in Europe in the number of flights and is also among the top 10 countries in terms of capacity and performance it announced on April 24.

As of April 22 operating 711 flights Turkish Airlines took the lead “flying more than twice as many flights as the airline in second place"" according to the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) data the carrier said in a statement.

Official Aviation Guide (OAG) data also showed that the flag carrier was among the top 10 airlines globally in terms of capacity and the leader in Europe the statement said.

İlker Aycı Turkish Airlines’ CEO said: ""I believe just like 2020 we will conclude 2021 as the airline that showed the best management in the face of the pandemic.""

In March Aycı presented figures showing Turkish Airlines became Europe’s leading network carrier in terms of flights operated – 44 domestic 165 international destinations – last year during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Only able to provide 40 percent of its 2019 capacity during 2020 the flag carrier airline experienced the lowest reduction in terms of passenger numbers (minus 62 percent) and was in the lead among network carriers when it comes to load factor (71 percent).""

On the cargo side the airline’s Turkish Cargo division was also a leading carrier in its field boosting its market share to 4.7 percent during 2020 by shouldering an important mission when countries closed their doors due to the pandemic.

The cargo carrier's ranking among global air cargo firms last year rose from 8th place to 6th.

The carrier also grew its market share to 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2021 while it reached a strong freight load factor at 82.2 percent versus a sector average of 63.4 percent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhaXhpbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vMjAyMS0wNC0yNC9jaGluYXMtZ3Vhbmd6aG91LW91c3RzLWF0bGFudGEtYXMtdG9wLWFpcnBvcnQtaW4tcGFuZGVtaWMteWVhci0xMDE2OTg0MDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China’s Guangzhou Ousts Atlanta as Top Airport in Pandemic Year,"(Bloomberg) — China’s Baiyun International Airport in Guangzhou topped the list of the world’s busiest hubs in a coronavirus-wracked 2020 knocking Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International off a perch it occupied for more than two decades.

Baiyun moved up from 11th place the trade group Airports Council International said in a statement capping a year when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global air travel. Hartsfield-Jackson slipped to second place as hubs in six Chinese cities including Guangzhou joined Beijing Capital International in the top 10 based on passenger traffic.

Airports in Chengdu in Central China and Shenzhen close to Hong Kong were among those that penetrated the elite group. Shanghai’s Hongqiao International surged 37 spots to make the grade while the city’s better-known Pudong where international flights typically land dropped off.

Guangzhou is the home base to China Southern Airlines Co. the country’s biggest carrier.





The report from the airline industry’s global trade body puts an official stamp on a changing-of-the-guard that was accelerated by the pandemic which slashed air travel around the world last year especially in Europe and the U.S. Gone from the top 10 are the main airports in Los Angeles Dubai Tokyo Chicago London and Paris.

China was already closing in on the U.S. as the top market before the outbreak. But its ability to contain the virus combined with a large domestic network made it the only major nation to fully recover capacity lost during the downturn — doing so despite its borders remaining mostly shut to international visitors.

“The impact remains uneven with different regions experiencing different challenges and requiring different policy decisions” ACI World Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira said in the statement.

With U.S. traffic starting to recover it’s entirely possible that Hartsfield-Jackson the home hub of Delta Air Lines Inc. will reclaim the top spot this year or next. It held the title for 22 years according to Simple Flying.

Overall passenger traffic at the world’s airports declined 65% last year according to ACI.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who will reveal details of the deployment to Parliament said: “When our Carrier Strike Group sets sail next month it will be flying the flag for Global Britain – projecting our influence signalling our power engaging with our friends and reaffirming our commitment to addressing the security challenges of today and tomorrow.

“The entire nation can be proud of the dedicated men and women who for more than six months will demonstrate to the world that the UK is not stepping back but sailing forth to play an active role in shaping the international system of the 21st century.”

The HMS Queen Elizabeth returns to Portsmouth Naval Base last month following sea trials and a visit to western Scotland ahead of its first operational deployment (Ben Mitchell/PA)

The deployment has been organised as part of the “UK’s tilt to the Indo-Pacific region” in a bid to “bolster deep defence partnerships” as well as to take part in an exercise to mark the 50th anniversary of the Five Power Defence Arrangements with Malaysia Singapore Australia and New Zealand.

Accompanying HMS Queen Elizabeth will be a surface fleet made up of Type 45 destroyers HMS Defender and HMS Diamond Type 23 anti-submarine frigates HMS Kent and HMS Richmond and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary’s RFA Fort Victoria and RFA Tidespring.

They may be a nuisance and an encounter can be painful but experts say their benefits are worth having them around.

Just about everybody seems to love butterflies but their immature caterpillar forms aren't as popular partially because some of the creeping critters can pack a powerful sting.

Experts are sharing that important reminder as the local caterpillar population is booming right now.

Molly Keck an entomology expert with Texas A &M AgriLife Extension says different species of caterpillars are higher numbers than they typically are in the spring.

How to spot asps & other stinging caterpillars

Keck said the best advice is to not touch caterpillars at all. Caterpillars turn into moths or butterflies which help with pollination of flowers trees fruits and vegetables. That means caterpillars have an important job!

""For most people we don't like the caterpillars in our landscape because they eat our plants"" Keck said. ""But the butterflies and the moths are pollinators so the immature form is is harmful whereas the adult form is beneficial.""

In Texas stinging caterpillars are commonly known as ""asps."" Chances are you've seen them or have been stung by them before.

""By and large my rule of thumb is that if you see a caterpillar that has hairs on its body don't touch it"" Keck said. ""It probably looks that way for a reason.""

Asps may infest trees and shrubs around homes schools and parks. They can cause a severe and painful sting. When they touch you their venomous hairs stick into the skin and cause a severe burning sensation and rash.

Texas A &M AgriLife Extension officials say you can treat a sting with an ice pack. You can also take oral antihistamines to help relieve the burning sensation and itching.

The state agency has a guide to help identify which caterpillars are harmful and which ones are harmless.

It seems only fitting that Bristol’s most infamous halls should be the most infamous caterpillar cake. You can always rely on an M&S cake to deliver at a birthday party in the same way you can always rely on Hiatt Baker girls wearing flares and air force. Colin is the ultimate BNOC.

Badock – Morris the Caterpillar Morrison’s

This is simply because the huge eyes bear striking resemblance to a Badock residents pupils on a Friday night. Or any night for that matter.

Wills – Cecil the Caterpillar Waitrose

Was there ever any other option for Wills. Wills residents are always unashamedly posh and devoted to Waitrose. Cecil the Caterpillar would be at a birthday party with smoked salmon blinis and Moët on tap. If this cake was a person he’d have a mullet and a signet ring.

Churchill – Connie the Caterpillar M&S

Churchill has a reputation for being rather posh and you would definitely expect to see a Churchill student doing their weekly shop at M&S. However they just don’t match Hiatt Baker’s reputation. For that reason they take M&S’s second best caterpillar cake. So close yet so far Churchill.

University Hall – Cuthbert the Caterpillar Aldi

It may not be the high end caterpillar cake like Colin and Connie but that doesn’t make it bad. Much like Aldi UH know that they’re budget and basic and they don’t apologise for it.

Durdham – Wiggles the caterpillar Sainsbury’s

Like Sainsbury’s missed the memo with the alliteration Durdham students missed the memo that they chose the worst Stoke Bishop accommodation. Like all the other supermarkets knew their caterpillar needed a name beginning with C we all knew about Deadham’s reputation but let’s not make them feel too bad about themselves.

City Centre – Curious Caterpillar Cake Co-op

This caterpillar is so irrelevant it doesn’t even have a name. Much like City Centre halls who are often grouped together because no one really cares about them. These halls are a curious concept to Stoke Bishop students who can’t understand why anyone wouldn’t want to live in Bristol’s best accommodation.

Goldney – Curly the Caterpillar Tesco

There’s nothing startingly awful about Goldney in the same way there’s nothing bad to say about Curly. Tesco is a very non-offensive supermarket and its hard to find fault with Curly. Well done Goldney you’re officially the most average accommodation.

Word from the Smokies

Monarch butterflies have begun their yearly northward migration and are due to arrive in Great Smoky Mountains National Park any day now.

This time of year you may start to see Danaus plexippus flying around the region. These attractive orange and black butterflies have made the long journey from their overwintering sites in central Mexico and are looking for mates and milkweed plants.

“Each of a male monarch’s hindwings has a scent gland that looks like a small black spot on its top surface” said Todd Witcher executive director of Discover Life in America (DLiA) a park partner organization. “These glands help entice females during courtship and are also helpful for distinguishing the sexes.”

After mating the female lays a single egg on the underside of a young milkweed leaf. She may travel far and wide to find enough satisfactory plants on which to lay her 300 to 400 eggs. After that her job is done and she will die.

The tiny monarch caterpillar emerges from its egg about 10 days later. It will devour its own eggshell and then begin to eat the milkweed plant that its mother carefully selected chewing through the thick leaves with its powerful mandibles. Commencing an eating frenzy the caterpillar will grow and shed its skin five times over about two weeks before it pupates into a green chrysalis accented with golden spots. It emerges as a new monarch butterfly after 7 to 10 days.

In eastern North America east of the Rocky Mountains the northward migration in monarchs takes place in stages. The first wave flies from Mexico to southern US states in the spring. There the butterflies reproduce on milkweed and die. When their progeny (the second wave) emerges in the summer they fly further northward into the northeastern and north-central US and eastern Canada to repeat the process. Amazingly their progeny (the grandchildren of the first wave) will travel thousands of miles to Mexico in one single trip in the fall.

Monarch caterpillars will only feed on milkweed plants and require it to reach adulthood. The plant’s name comes from its thick white sap which oozes out when a leaf is pierced or a stem is broken. The sap is distasteful to most herbivores including insects but monarchs love it.

This “milk” contains a class of defensive chemicals called cardiac glucosides which provide additional protection to the plant from would-be herbivores. These chemicals become concentrated in the caterpillars as they feed and grow so that monarch larvae and subsequent adults become distasteful to birds and other predators. The contrasting black and white stripes on the caterpillars and orange and black pattern on the adults warn predators not to eat them.

“Eight different milkweed species have been documented in the Smokies as part of the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory” said Witcher referring to a project managed by DLiA to catalog every species living in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. “They take on a variety of shapes sizes and flower colors.”

According to the U.S. Forest Service at least seven of the park’s milkweed species can serve as hostplants for monarchs.

“Monarch caterpillars can be seen in Cades Cove” said Becky Nichols entomologist at Great Smoky Mountains National Park “as well as Cataloochee Valley and other sunny meadows in the park where milkweed is present.”

The park has mapped milkweed in Cades Cove and works to schedule management activities such as mowing and prescribed burning to accommodate the monarch life cycle.

“Timing is critical so that plants are ready and available for the monarchs” said Nichols.

Despite efforts to protect them monarch populations have been declining in recent years. The Xerces Society a Portland-based nonprofit devoted to insect conservation has reported an 80% decline in monarch numbers east of the Rocky Mountains. The organization attributes this dramatic drop in monarchs to three main causes: habitat loss from development and agriculture increased usage of pesticides and herbicides and climate change. Researchers have documented a similar plight for many other pollinating insects as well.

How can you help? One of the best ways is to plant native milkweed in your yard or other greenspaces.

“Ask your local nursery for native milkweed that has not been treated with insecticides” said Witcher. “Most places sell non-native milkweed species but these can carry diseases that can harm monarchs.”

Milkweed is not just good for monarchs it also provides nectar for a wide variety of other insect pollinators including bees other butterflies and even some fireflies and serves as the hostplant for a few other insect species that can tolerate its defensive chemicals.

“Milkweed is a wonderful addition to any native garden in Southern Appalachia” said Witcher “it looks nice it smells nice and it’s a great source of nourishment for lots of species.”

Colin the Caterpillar has been in the news a lot recently thanks to a very public dispute with Cuthburt.

M&S who make Colin has launched legal action against Aldi claiming it has infringed the copyright of the cake by producing Cuthbert.

And after seeing the nation split one chippy is throwing its weight firmly behind Cuthbert – by ‘battering’ Colin.

Papa’s Fish and Chips which has branches in Hull Cleethorpes Whitby and Scarborough is selling deep-fried mini Colins.

Yes that’s right – Colin dipped in batter and fried in oil for a truly indulgent treat.

After the Aldi social media team tried to settle the row with a #Caterpillarsforcancer campaign the fish and chip shop thought they could do something to help too.

Posting on Twitter Papa’s said: ‘Sorry @MarksandSpencer we’re backing @AldiUK on this one. #SnitchersGetBattered so we’re battering Colin the Caterpillar in our delicious sweet batter Mon 26th – and all profits go to @teencancertrust.’

The deep-fried treats cost £1.49 each with the money going to the charity.

Anyone in the area who wants to try one needs to be quick though as they’ll only be available tomorrow.

Owner Dino told the Grimsby Telegraph: ‘It’s all a bit of fun and a great way to raise money for charity.

‘Like the rest of the nation we have been gripped by the Colin and Cuthbert saga and we’ve chosen which side we are backing.

‘The battered caterpillars are also absolutely delicious so we thought why not?

‘We are buying as many mini Colins as we can and they will be battered in our sweet batter and available in all restaurants on Monday.’

CBRE,CBRE Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3JldGFpbC9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy9yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLXJlc3BvbmQtZGVtYW5kLWRyaXZlLXRocnVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurants Developers Line Up for Drive-Thrus,"When it comes to drive-thru service Sweetgreen Inc. has a green light.



The Culver City-based salad chain one of many restaurant companies looking to meet pandemic-era demand for drive-thrus expects to open its first drive-thru outpost later this year.



Sweetgreen joins chains like Shake Shack Inc. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Starbucks Corp. and Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers which have all announced plans to increase their drive-thru presence nationwide.



Once largely the province of fast-food brands drive-thrus have been embraced by quick-service restaurants over the past year as consumers sought out socially distanced contact-free food options.



For local developers and property management companies who build and lease locations to these chains the scramble is on to create stand-alone drive-thru restaurants or to increase drive-thru capabilities at their existing properties.



“Demand was already accelerating for drive-thrus even pre-Covid because a lot of these tenants — whether it’s Starbucks or Chipotle or Habit Burger Grill — their drive-thru restaurants were already doing significantly higher volumes than their non-drive-thru restaurants” said Terrison Quinn managing principal at SRS Real Estate Partners.



“Covid has really just been an accelerant to that trend and a big accelerant. When Covid hit it became all the more apparent to them that this is how we have to expand moving forward” he added.



Brian McDonald a first vice president at CBRE Group Inc. said business at restaurants before the pandemic was generally 70% dine-in and 30% drive-thru. Now that has reversed and restaurant chains are eager to take advantage of the trend.

Tabassum Zalotrawala chief development officer at Chipotle said in an email that 70% of the company’s new locations in 2021 would have a Chipotlane the company’s version of a drive-thru. In locations where a drive-thru is impossible the company will instead have walk-up windows.



Todd Graves founder and chief executive at Louisiana-based Raising Cane’s said drive-thrus gave the company a sales boost.



“Throughout the pandemic our drive-thrus allowed us to not only maintain our business but actually increase our sales as it was a safe way to continue to serve our customers” he said in an email. “We continue to grow our drive-thru restaurants as well as our inline locations that are dine-in only.”



In June Starbucks shared plans to expand drive-thrus and mobile-only pickups and curbside pickups.



Chris Maling a principal with Avison Young Inc. said the coffee chain was “way ahead of the game with their drive-thru only stores.”



“It’s a home run” he added. “Starbucks says we don’t want to do cafes anymore; people are just hanging out using our free Wi-Fi and not ordering anything. It is not a profitable business model.”



Rising sales



Orders at drive-thru locations have been increasing. Peter Spragg a senior managing director at Newmark Group Inc. said drive-thrus saw a 25% to 35% increase in sales during the pandemic. “The one category that continued to have momentum was drive-thrus” he said.



In October alone drive-thru sales increased 24% according to NPD Group Inc.



“Drive-thrus were always part of the business plan with quick-serve restaurant concepts. They kind of went away from that because they were saying we could do a smaller footprint at college campuses and food courts and not have to have a drive-thru” Maling said.



“Fast forward to the Covid pandemic and rules were made that completely upended the restaurant industry. As a result of that concepts that had drive-thrus absolutely were Covid compliant and thrived. The sales that they were ringing up were phenomenal. All these companies started to say to themselves ‘Why do we need stores that have sit-down dining or outdoor dining when we’re making a boatload of money though our drive-thrus?’”



Barbara Armendariz president and founder of SharpLine Commercial Partners said fast-food restaurants going after drive-thru only locations was not “going to be a short-lived trend. I think that’s going to be ongoing. You can process significantly more people through those lines. The reduced footprint also decreases expenses.”



Drive-thru-only locations have a much smaller storefront than a dine-in restaurant. They also have lower expenses with fewer paper products needed no refills and less table cleaning.



Quinn of SRS Real Estate Partners said drive-thrus are “pandemic proof” and that some restaurants are now only interested in locations where they can have a drive-thru. He added that he saw more drive-thru deals in the past 12 months than in the previous three years.



David Greensfelder of Greensfelder Commercial Real Estate said drive-thrus were out-performing all other retail categories when it comes to leasing and sales.



“From the retailer’s perspective it makes all the sense in the world. Retailers really need to continue to show unit growth and sales growth to Wall Street in order to have favorable ratings for growth for stock growth for credit ratings to be able to attract capital” Greensfelder said.



Waiting on approvals



But adding a drive-thru lane is not always easy. It often means multiple entrances and exits to a property enough room for a line of cars and city approvals which developers and experts agree can be tricky to get.



Shauna Mattis an executive vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. said that prior to the pandemic moratoriums on drive-thrus made them difficult to build and existing ones “got some pretty good lease rates.” These moratoriums exist for a multitude of reasons including people not wanting drive-thru-related traffic in their neighborhoods environmental concerns associated with idling cars and complaints that fast-food drive-thrus contribute to the obesity epidemic.



But Covid-19 she said put pressure on cities to approve drive-thrus. She expects to see more moving forward in addition to things like curbside pickup options and temperature-controlled lockers where people can pick up their food using a code.



“These lockers and curbside pickup allow for a lot more turnover. People aren’t sitting on their property for as long” she said.



Most drive-thrus are not conversions of other buildings but ground-up developments.

Jim Kruse chief executive at El Segundo-based DPI Retail said his company is interested in having more drive-thrus on its properties and is even seeking approval for one now.



“There’s no shortage of desire” he said.



DPI has eight drive-thru properties in its portfolio and is looking to double that in the next five years.



Experts say the lease and development structures for many drive-thrus makes them desirable to investors.



Locations are often leased on a triple net basis. In that case the tenant can be responsible for everything from utilities to roof repair to taxes. The tenant is able to use the location without having to buy it and a landlord is able to collect rent without having to do much work.



Other drive-thru properties are done as a ground lease in which different entities own land and the improvements on the land. Again the owner gets steady monthly income without doing any work and when the ground lease ends gets the improvements on the land.

The answer seems to be trending toward low-rise.



“We’ve seen tenants contemplating going from a more high-rise office building to a low-rise campus or free-standing buildings where they feel more comfortable controlling their own destiny and controlling their own space” said Natalie Bazarevitsch a senior vice president at CBRE Group Inc.



Bazarevitsch said some tenants have found taller buildings to be more difficult to work out of during the pandemic because they are generally more crowded. Users need to space out and wait for elevators in the building and parking garages and hold for temperature checks in lobbies.



“They said it was impacting their culture and their time just to go in and out of their building” Bazarevitsch said.



Low-rise buildings on the other hand allow for common areas with fewer people and often come with coveted outdoor space and separate entrances.



Bill Bloodgood an executive managing director at the Newmark Group Inc. said the company is seeing more interest across all property types but there’s one clear winner.



“The low-rise product is definitely outperforming high-rise products where you can have your own entrance or walk up a stairwell to your entrance. (It) is definitely the preferred product type” Bloodgood said.



When there’s demand for low-rise space it’s readily apparent in the Los Angeles market where there are fewer options compared with other asset types.



“There is limited low-rise space. There is much more high-rise space” Bloodgood said. “When you see a pickup in demand for low-rise you really feel it.”



Accelerated trend



The trend Bloodgood said “was there before Covid” but has been accelerated due to the pandemic.



John Eric Chung principal and Los Angeles office leader at CallisonRTKL agreed.



“In L.A. there has always been a preference toward more suburban low-rise buildings usually that house conversions and creative offices in places like Venice Santa Monica and the Arts District in downtown” Chung said. “There’s always been high demand for that and they garner higher rents. This probably is because in Los Angeles there is a huge concentration of creative industries.”



The hallmarks of creative office space are high ceilings natural materials open floorplans and lots of light.



The other thing that makes low-rise space so appealing especially now is combined indoor and outdoor environments. Market experts say demand for outdoor space started pre-Covid but has become an even bigger factor since.



“We have a new appreciation of the outdoors because of Covid” Chung said.

He added that high-rise buildings have tried to add more outdoor space as well like terraces and balconies.



Some tenants are also working to turn their plazas from pleasant outdoor areas to places where people can actually work. Chung said some high-rises are even tearing down or pushing back walls to create outdoor terraces.



Christopher Cooper a principal with Avison Young Inc. said high-rise buildings have added features that make them as safe as low-slung buildings. “It’s a matter of perception” he said that’s driving some tenants to steer clear of towers.



‘Hub and spoke’ model



Looking forward experts predict low-rise suburban office buildings will see increased demand as some companies move to a “hub and spoke” model.



With a hub-and-spoke approach a company may have one big office space in an area like downtown and smaller satellite offices in more suburban areas near where some employees live. That arrangement gives employees the option to gather at a central hub and to work out of the “spokes” at other times.



“There are many companies especially larger ones condensed in the downtown area looking at hub-and-spoke models where they might continue to operate in a downtown-type or city-type market and open smaller offices and some conference centers in the different suburban submarkets” Bender said. “That hub-and-spoke model is being heavily considered and interpreted in different ways.”



Bazarevitsch agreed but added that there are lots of factors to consider.

“Companies are evaluating whether they are going to go to the hub-and-spoke method. If so operational efficiency gets affected” she said.



John Drachman co-founder of Waterford Property Co. which has substantial holdings in Long Beach and Orange County said companies might find low-rise buildings appealing simply because they tend to be located outside of dense urban areas.



“We have seen a fairly large difference within our portfolio of tenants that prefer lower rise buildings” he said. “I am not sure if it is due to concerns over elevators or surface garages or rather (that) the low-rise product is in more suburban locations.”



Free rent



Whether in a high-rise or a low-rise building landlords are doing what they can to entice tenants to sign or renew leases and return to offices.



To encourage companies to sign leases landlords are offering concessions including increased tenant improvement allowances free rent free or reduced parking rates and flexible lease terms.



“The whole economic package has gotten more aggressive to try and get tenants back in the office” Bloodgood said.



Longer leases can also mean even more concessions.



“The landlords are getting more generous with their tenant improvement allowances for the right type of tenants and a long enough occupancy commitment” Cooper said.

Building owners market observers say have also worked to update air filtration systems and clearing procedures.



But there are still elements to be considered by companies eager to have employees return to the office.



“There’s so much going into the office space discussion the high-rise to low-rise is just one of those discussions” Bazarevitsch said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdG90YWxmb29kLmNvbS9maWxpcGluby1mYXZvcml0ZS1qb2xsaWJlZS1pbmtzLXBhY3QtZm9yLXRpbWVzLXNxdWFyZS1mbGFnc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Filipino Favorite Jollibee Inks Pact for Times Square Flagship,"Jollibee is betting on Times Square. The popular Filipino is betting on Times Square. The popular Filipino fast-food chain has inked a lease to open a 7127-square-foot flagship at 1500 Broadway between West 43rd and West 44th streets. The space includes 3127 square feet of ground floor retail space as well as 4000 square feet on the lower level.

Jollibee has more than 1300 locations worldwide but just two other New York City locations at 6229 Roosevelt Avenue in Woodside and 609 Eighth Avenue in Midtown. When the original Manhattan location opened in 2018 fans of the brand waited in hours-long lines to sample its popular Chickenjoy — a dish of fried chicken with rice and gravy.

The Jolibee story is truly one for a movie script. In 1975 Tony Tan Caktiong and his family opened an ice cream parlor in Cubao Phillipines. The outlet later began offering hot meals and sandwiches upon request from customers. When the food items became more popular than ice cream the family decided to convert the ice cream parlor into a fast-food restaurant and became the first Jollibee outlet in 1978.

By the end of the first year of operation there were seven branches in Metro Manila. The first franchised outlet of Jollibee opened in Manila in 1979. As Jollibee experienced rapid growth it was able to withstand the entry of McDonald’s in the Philippines in 1981 by focusing on the specific tastes of the Filipino market which differed from the American fast food company.

Jollibee will bring several American-influenced items as well as casual Filipino fare to its new Midtown flagship. Among the establishment’s best sellers are the Yumburger the house hamburger first introduced during their early days of operation; the Chickenjoy a fried chicken meal introduced in the 1980s; and Jolly Spaghetti their sweet-style interpretation of spaghetti. which is being advertised as “the meatiest cheesiest spaghetti”. Jollibee’s first outlet in North America opened in the United States in California in June of 1998.

CBRE’s New York team of Amira Yunis Anthony Stanford Henry Rossignol and Elliot Ferris facilitated the negotiations for the Times Square transaction representing both the tenant and landlord Tamares Real Estate. The building’s other retail tenants include Starbucks and Citizen Watch. Fast-food restaurants have done well in the pandemic. They paid 92 percent of their rent in the month of January according to a report by Datex Property Solutions.

S&T at the Core



Customised to Operational Needs



Going Beyond the Book



“How do you know if your handphone is safe to use?” asked a confident voice amidst a huddle of fresh-faced Singapore Police Force National Service Trainees.We were in a gallery at the Home Team Academy’s Training Village that featured a range of CBRNE (Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosives) exhibits. In front of the Trainees stood Dr Alister Peh a CBRNE Scientist with the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) conducting a lesson on the fundamentals of CBRNE.The Trainees were keen to learn more. The next hour was filled with whispered responses to Dr Alister’s questions and bodies leaning forward in curiosity as he led them through the gallery and explained how HTX works to counter the threats posed by CBRNE materials.As for Dr Alister’s question about whether our handphones are safe to use the answer was that mobile devices emit low levels of electromagnetic radiation that can interfere with sensitive instruments found on planes and in hospitals. This radiation is non-ionising and has been determined to pose no risk to people. The Trainees nodded in understanding.Armed with such nuggets of information the Trainees were tasked at the end of the lesson to complete a worksheet to assess if they’d learnt about the serious threat posed by attacks using CBRNE materials and how best to protect themselves and members of the public.This scene offered just a small peek into Dr Alister’s work as a Trainer. Most of us may not be aware of the potential threat posed by CBRNE materials so Dr Alister and his colleagues at HTX’s CBRNE Training School have a vital part to play. “I feel a sense of joy when I see Trainees understand what we’ve shared with them” he said.Dr Alister first made the jump to training after completing a doctorate in Chemistry at the National University of Singapore . Though he was keen to become an educator and share his knowledge of S&T with others he wanted to do so in a way that would contribute to a bigger cause – Singapore’s safety and the operational readiness of our Home Team officers.As a member of HTX’s CBRNE Training School Dr Alister conducts scenario-based lessons and training sessions for officers from across the Home Team. What these lessons share is a focus on employing S&T as a force multiplier and enabler.“We need to know how to use our S&T detectors and tools correctly in order to ensure optimal results on the ground” he said. “That’s why we provide officers with theory-based lessons and also teach them to use their detectors properly so that they can be effective on the ground.”The CBRNE Training School customises its training programmes according to the requirements of each Home Team Department. For example new officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) attend a compulsory two-day CBRNE module as part of their Basic Training. They may subsequently undergo advanced and refresher programmes based of their responsibilities on the frontline.Close simulants and live agents of CBRNE materials are employed during practical lessons to help officers gain confidence in using their equipment. “The officers can see firsthand how their detectors actually respond to such materials"" said Dr Alister. ""This also reminds them that they must know their Standard Operating Procedures when they detect CBRNE materials.”Hands-on learning and practice for officers is vital too. Practical assessments for ICA officers include searching for and detecting CBRNE materials that have been concealed in a vehicle or within a traveller's belongings.During these sessions Dr Alister encourages the officers to share their experiences so that they can all learn together. “We’re not just imparting knowledge to our officers” he said “but drawing insights from them as well.”To optimise the time that officers devote to training Dr Alister and his fellow Trainers make sure that their lessons – in the classroom and beyond – are thorough. “We design our training materials so that officers receive the necessary information to do their work well” he explained “but we never compromise on the quality of our lessons as lives are at stake.”This commitment was evident as Dr Alister collected back the worksheets from the Trainees at the end of his lesson and took a moment to check that they’d understood his key points. “It makes me happy when officers appreciate the knowledge they’ve learnt and can apply this on the job in order to keep Singapore safe and secure” he said. “That’s the biggest achievement for me because it feels like I’ve done my job well.”"

The group from Stop Animal Experiments Kent are part of a worldwide effort marking World Day For Animals In Laboratories which is observed every year on April 24.

The surrounding week has come to be known as “World Week for Animals In Laboratories”. The National Anti-Vivisection Society describe the day as an “international day of commemoration” for animals in laboratories.

The protestors wearing animal masks are highlighting their objection to experimentation carried out at the site. A Kent Police patrol has been to the scene and officers say the protest is peaceful and there are no issues to report.

Member Evie Tuffs said: “Today is World Day for Animals in Laboratories. We are here at Charles River in Manston to protest the breeding and testing on animals by Charles River bringing to the public’s attention that animals suffer in animal experimentation.

The Culver City-based salad chain one of many restaurant companies looking to meet pandemic-era demand for drive-thrus expects to open its first drive-thru outpost later this year.



Sweetgreen joins chains like Shake Shack Inc. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Starbucks Corp. and Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers which have all announced plans to increase their drive-thru presence nationwide.



Once largely the province of fast-food brands drive-thrus have been embraced by quick-service restaurants over the past year as consumers sought out socially distanced contact-free food options.



For local developers and property management companies who build and lease locations to these chains the scramble is on to create stand-alone drive-thru restaurants or to increase drive-thru capabilities at their existing properties.



“Demand was already accelerating for drive-thrus even pre-Covid because a lot of these tenants — whether it’s Starbucks or Chipotle or Habit Burger Grill — their drive-thru restaurants were already doing significantly higher volumes than their non-drive-thru restaurants” said Terrison Quinn managing principal at SRS Real Estate Partners.



“Covid has really just been an accelerant to that trend and a big accelerant. When Covid hit it became all the more apparent to them that this is how we have to expand moving forward” he added.



Brian McDonald a first vice president at CBRE Group Inc. said business at restaurants before the pandemic was generally 70% dine-in and 30% drive-thru. Now that has reversed and restaurant chains are eager to take advantage of the trend.

Tabassum Zalotrawala chief development officer at Chipotle said in an email that 70% of the company’s new locations in 2021 would have a Chipotlane the company’s version of a drive-thru. In locations where a drive-thru is impossible the company will instead have walk-up windows.



Todd Graves founder and chief executive at Louisiana-based Raising Cane’s said drive-thrus gave the company a sales boost.



“Throughout the pandemic our drive-thrus allowed us to not only maintain our business but actually increase our sales as it was a safe way to continue to serve our customers” he said in an email. “We continue to grow our drive-thru restaurants as well as our inline locations that are dine-in only.”



In June Starbucks shared plans to expand drive-thrus and mobile-only pickups and curbside pickups.



Chris Maling a principal with Avison Young Inc. said the coffee chain was “way ahead of the game with their drive-thru only stores.”



“It’s a home run” he added. “Starbucks says we don’t want to do cafes anymore; people are just hanging out using our free Wi-Fi and not ordering anything. It is not a profitable business model.”



Rising sales



Orders at drive-thru locations have been increasing. Peter Spragg a senior managing director at Newmark Group Inc. said drive-thrus saw a 25% to 35% increase in sales during the pandemic. “The one category that continued to have momentum was drive-thrus” he said.



In October alone drive-thru sales increased 24% according to NPD Group Inc.



“Drive-thrus were always part of the business plan with quick-serve restaurant concepts. They kind of went away from that because they were saying we could do a smaller footprint at college campuses and food courts and not have to have a drive-thru” Maling said.



“Fast forward to the Covid pandemic and rules were made that completely upended the restaurant industry. As a result of that concepts that had drive-thrus absolutely were Covid compliant and thrived. The sales that they were ringing up were phenomenal. All these companies started to say to themselves ‘Why do we need stores that have sit-down dining or outdoor dining when we’re making a boatload of money though our drive-thrus?’”



Barbara Armendariz president and founder of SharpLine Commercial Partners said fast-food restaurants going after drive-thru only locations was not “going to be a short-lived trend. I think that’s going to be ongoing. You can process significantly more people through those lines. The reduced footprint also decreases expenses.”



Drive-thru-only locations have a much smaller storefront than a dine-in restaurant. They also have lower expenses with fewer paper products needed no refills and less table cleaning.



Quinn of SRS Real Estate Partners said drive-thrus are “pandemic proof” and that some restaurants are now only interested in locations where they can have a drive-thru. He added that he saw more drive-thru deals in the past 12 months than in the previous three years.



David Greensfelder of Greensfelder Commercial Real Estate said drive-thrus were out-performing all other retail categories when it comes to leasing and sales.



“From the retailer’s perspective it makes all the sense in the world. Retailers really need to continue to show unit growth and sales growth to Wall Street in order to have favorable ratings for growth for stock growth for credit ratings to be able to attract capital” Greensfelder said.



Waiting on approvals



But adding a drive-thru lane is not always easy. It often means multiple entrances and exits to a property enough room for a line of cars and city approvals which developers and experts agree can be tricky to get.



Shauna Mattis an executive vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. said that prior to the pandemic moratoriums on drive-thrus made them difficult to build and existing ones “got some pretty good lease rates.” These moratoriums exist for a multitude of reasons including people not wanting drive-thru-related traffic in their neighborhoods environmental concerns associated with idling cars and complaints that fast-food drive-thrus contribute to the obesity epidemic.



But Covid-19 she said put pressure on cities to approve drive-thrus. She expects to see more moving forward in addition to things like curbside pickup options and temperature-controlled lockers where people can pick up their food using a code.



“These lockers and curbside pickup allow for a lot more turnover. People aren’t sitting on their property for as long” she said.



Most drive-thrus are not conversions of other buildings but ground-up developments.

Jim Kruse chief executive at El Segundo-based DPI Retail said his company is interested in having more drive-thrus on its properties and is even seeking approval for one now.



“There’s no shortage of desire” he said.



DPI has eight drive-thru properties in its portfolio and is looking to double that in the next five years.



Experts say the lease and development structures for many drive-thrus makes them desirable to investors.



Locations are often leased on a triple net basis. In that case the tenant can be responsible for everything from utilities to roof repair to taxes. The tenant is able to use the location without having to buy it and a landlord is able to collect rent without having to do much work.



Other drive-thru properties are done as a ground lease in which different entities own land and the improvements on the land. Again the owner gets steady monthly income without doing any work and when the ground lease ends gets the improvements on the land.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

He departed with a sole NXT Tag Team title to his name alongside Kalisto and now 43 de Oro is still hungry to achieve his dreams in wrestling.



Speaking to talkSPORT de Oro explained how it was some blunt words from Paul Heyman that made him realise his time in WWE was over.

“I had been talking to a lot of people a couple of years behind. I didn’t take my decision one day after the other it was a process throughout the last few years where I was already thinking about it” de Oro explained.

“Is it the right decision? Do I stay here do I leave? Am I going to get the opportunities I really want here if I stay?

“I spoke with a lot of people. The last thing that really hurt me was when I spoke with Paul Heyman and he said ‘Sin Cara is dead’ - he told me straight up like that.

“It really hurt me because I was like ‘Man that’s what you really think of me and what I do?’ We talked a little more and I said maybe we could do something with the character. Maybe a Spiderman deal where I lead a normal life as this person and then when I put on the mask I’m this performer. ‘No no no that doesn’t work.’

“What about if I have my mask open here [points to his mouth] so they can hear me talk and I can do more facials? ‘No then you’re not Sin Cara anymore because they can see your mouth.’ It was just a lot of excuses.”



Sin Cara’s final match in WWE would be with Drew McIntyre and it’s a good job the luchador owed the Brit a favour.

“But when he told me that I knew that I was done. That day I had a match with Drew McIntyre in Manchester where he was going to squash me and I did it because it was him. If it was anybody else I wouldn’t have done it.

“But I knew because he had helped me before and done the job for me when he first left so I had to return the favour. That was it.”

Once he publicly requested his release it took WWE a month to grant him his wish.

“It was just sad after that. After the match I didn’t speak to anybody. Took a shower got dressed and then went to the bus to continue the tour and that was the night I started writing my statement to get released.

5 Sin Cara was a popular star in WWE in his prime

“I started writing and praying it was the right decision to make. I posted it on November 11 2019 in the middle of a European tour I was in Vienna Austria! It was tough it was a sad day for me.

“Realising I was never going to get that opportunity to succeed in that company. And when I got the call a month later for my release it was the first time they never lied to me.

“‘You know what you will never get the opportunity that you want here.’ They told me straight up like that. That was Mark Carrano. And I understand his place was in the middle I never took it personal with him. He treated me very cool to this day.

“Knowing I would never get the opportunity I want there I then knew I made the right decision for me my kids and my family. And things started opening up right away; calls from London for Comican tours in Japan Mexico and then the pandemic hit. That was the toughest thing.

5 Sin Cara spent a decade in WWE

“But I’ve been happier during this time of my life than many years before which is pretty sad to say because I was working for the best wrestling company in the world.

“But everything has a purpose god has different plans and I’m just rolling with the punches continuing to be happy. If you’re happy that’s the main thing. Everything else will fall into place.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhcy5jb20vaHlwZS9yZWFkLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvMTA1MDUyMjY2L3RlbnRhbmctbGFndS1tZW5jYXJpLWNpbnRhLWtvbGFib3Jhc2ktYW50YXJhLW5vYWgtZGFuLWJjbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtvbXBhcy5jb20vaHlwZS9yZWFkLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvMTA1MDUyMjY2L3RlbnRhbmctbGFndS1tZW5jYXJpLWNpbnRhLWtvbGFib3Jhc2ktYW50YXJhLW5vYWgtZGFuLWJjbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tentang Lagu Mencari Cinta Kolaborasi antara NOAH dan BCL - Kompas.com,"JAKARTA KOMPAS.com - Grup band NOAH dan penyanyi Bunga Citra Lestari berkolaborasi lewat singel yang berudul “Mencari Cinta”.

Setelah saya pikir pikir dan telaah setiap lirik lagu yang di nyanyikan oleh Bung saya sangat sepakat dengan lirik yang ada pada lagu tersebut.

Ketika kita ""laki laki"" mendatangi rumah seorang Perempuan Sering kali kita terjebak dengan pertanyaan: kenapa kamu mencintai anak saya? Dan ketika kita jawab dengan kata ""karena"" Lebih baik mundur dan pulang. Karena memang menurutnya cinta tidak membutuhkan alasan dengan kata ""karena"".

Memang rasa cinta kepada seseorang diawali dengan alasan umum: karena dia baik cantik dan sebagainya. Tetapi menurut saya rasa cinta itu mutlak karena cinta itu hati yang tanpa mengenal alasan dengan kata ""Karena"".

Kau ataupun aku rela melakukan apa saja bahkan hal gila sekalipun demi mendapatkan seseorang yang kita cintai. Ketika ada orang yang bertanya: kenapa kau rela melakukan itu? Maka jawabanya hanya: karena aku mencintainya.

Ketika mencintai seseorang kita rela memberikan apa saja bahkan nyawa sekalipun hanya untuk seseorang yang kita cintai. Ketika ada yang bertanya kenapa kau rela melakukan hal gila itu jawabanku hanya: karena aku mencintainya.

Ketika seseorang yang kau cintai mengecewakanmu atau tak menanggap semua yang kau lakukan tidak berarti dan hanya meninggalkan luka yang dalam sakit yang perih kau dengan mudah memaafkannya dan mengikhlaskannya pergi.

Kalau ada orang yang bertanya: kenapa kau membiarkannya pergi setelah semua yang kau berikan untuknya?. kau hanya menjawab "" Karena aku mencintainya biarkan dia pergi dan aku mencintainya dengan caraku sendiri"".

Jika kau tidak mengikhlasnya untuk pergi dan semua yang kau lakukan adalah pengorbanan maka itu bukan cinta itu kalkulasi karena cinta tidak membutuhkan pengorbanan.

""Cinta ini kadang kadang tak ada logika"" Lirik lagu Agnes Mo. Dari lirik di atas saya sepakat kalau cinta susah untuk diartikan dengan logika karena cinta itu kata hati. Ketika kau mencintai seseorang karena menggunakan logika hanya untuk meinginkan hasrat maka itu bukan cinta itu hanya nafsu.

Jika saat ini kamu mencintai seseorang dengan alasan maka mulailah untuk mencintai tanpa alasan dan melakukan apa saja tanpa membutuhkan timbal balik atau motif yang lain. Kecuali jika kau benar benar mencintainya.

It looks like “Love & Hip Hop” veterans Peter Gunz and Cisco Rasado will be facing off in the boxing ring and recently they gave everyone a little preview on what they could expect when it comes to their boxing match.

Peter and Ciscio’s fight is the latest celebrity boxing match that is being promoted by the boxing company Celebrity Boxing. On Thursday the press conference for Peter and Cisco’s fight was held in Atlanta and when the two former Creep Squad members came face to face things got a little heated.

Peter could be heard telling Cisco “Listen man at the end of the day we brothers” and then said “It’s an easy five for me” before he threw a quick punch at Cisco causing some commotion.

Some people thought that it was for a reality show as other familiar faces from “Love & Hip Hop” were present at the press conference but Deb Antney was present and let everyone know that the little scuffle between Peter and Cisco was not staged.

She said “This is not a scene for Love n Hip-hop. I was confused also but @petergunz174 swung on @cisco_rosado not acting for tv this was real as hell.”

Now fans of “Love & Hip Hop” know this not Peter and Cisco’s first time putting the paws on each other. They have been known to get into it in the past.

Peter and Cisco’s fight will be taking place on June 12th in Atlantic City at the Showboat Hotel. They are fighting on the same bill as Lamar Odom and Aaron Carter which was previously reported.

DFEH had previously filed the case at the District Court of the Northern District of California on behalf of John Doe a Dalit employee against two upper caste superiors. The agency said it cannot disclose the reason for the change in court as it invades attorney client privilege.

When the lawsuit was initially filed on June 30 it was the first time a state agency sued on grounds of caste putting the caste bias in Silicon Valley in the spotlight. The lawsuit accused two upper-caste Brahmins Sundara Iyer and Raman Kompella of harassing Doe in their capacity as managers. Cisco was sued for allegedly denying the worker who immigrated to the U.S. from India raises and professional opportunities as well as making him “endure a hostile work environment.” The lawsuit further alleged that Doe could not get any relief from the company despite filing a complaint as early as 2016. The human resources department could not take any action on grounds of caste discrimination since it was not unlawful in the U.S.

The caste system is an ancient way in which India organizes people into a social hierarchy. Therefore some Indian’s are fortunate to be categorized from birth as Brahmins which are the people who are part of the dominant caste in India. While others were born into the lowest level of the caste system known as Dalits. Despite social progress many Dalits to this day still experience discrimination and even violence in India yet it is not until recently that this discrimination followed Indian tech workers to the United States.

This lawsuit is being filed in Santa Clara County where Cisco is headquartered in and it will be the first lawsuit to attempt to prove that caste discrimination is also a violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. Thus if John Doe’s lawsuit succeeds in proving this then it will make history as the first major case to recognize the workplace discrimination Dalits in America’s private sectors are experiencing.

Since this lawsuit was filed many more complaints regarding caste discrimination have been coming forward from other tech workers in companies like Microsoft Facebook Twitter and Google.

Since this lawsuit was filed many more complaints regarding caste discrimination have been coming forward from other tech workers in companies like Microsoft Facebook Twitter and Google.

Cisco itself has released a statement though its spokesperson Robyn Blum stating “Cisco is committed to an inclusive workplace for all. We have robust processes to report and investigate concerns raised by employees which were followed in this case dating back to 2016 and have determined we were fully in compliance with all laws as well as our own policies. Cisco will vigorously defend itself against the allegations made in this complaint.”

The Santa Clara County Human Rights Commission has scheduled a “public forum relating to the caste system” on Thursday April 29 2021 at 6:00pm PT. The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) is urging Hindu Americans to take action and email the SCC Human Rights Commission to express their views on this very complex and sensitive issue.

The HAF has issued the following statement:“Hindu Americans strongly condemn all forms of discrimination including caste-based discrimination and firmly believe that there is no place for prejudice and mistreatment of anyone in America’s diverse and pluralistic society. For anyone facing caste discrimination federal and California state law already protects individuals under the existing categories of national origin ancestry and ethnicity all of which have been interpreted as inclusive of ancestry (lineage) birthplace culture ethnicity or language — the various factors that might be associated with caste. The addition “caste” as a specific protected category however would single out and wrongly target only one community based on its members’ race ethnicity ancestry national origin and religion thereby violating their rights to equal protection and due process under both the U.S. Constitution and California law. It would label all people ofIndian descent as members of a suspect class as a matter of policy. It will leave children of Indian descent or origin vulnerable to bullying in schools and all people of Indian descent or origin vulnerable to discrimination in hiring firing and growth or subject to hostile work environments by the County or companies based in Santa Clara County. The solution to discrimination should not lead to more discrimination and the erroneous addition of such a category would do just that.”

For those who are human rights activists the decision by the State of California to sue tech giant Cisco for allowing caste-based discrimination to occur unchecked was a major breakthrough. It felt like there was finally some sign of responsibility taken by a government to tackle the issues of casteism imported by the South Asian diaspora and that such behavior would no longer go unnoticed. Most importantly of all it was widely covered by a number of news outlets and raised awareness of the insidious nature of caste-based discrimination and the ‘real life’ effects on individuals.

The Inland Real Estate Group of Companies has purchased a portfolio of 11 Stop & Shop grocery store locations throughout Massachusetts Rhode Island and Connecticut for a combined $295 million.

The package of properties included the following properties in RI: 595 Smithfield Road North Smithfield; 446 Putnam Turnpike Greenville; and 333 West River Sreet Providence.

The Inland Real Estate Group of Companies Inc. which is headquartered in Oak Brook Illinois employs more than 1000 nationwide. Inland states that it owns and manages hundreds of millions of square feet of various commercial property types in 49 states.

Winstanley Enterprises and Surry Equities sold the single-tenant retail portfolio which spans a combined 748141 square feet.

The Boston Business Journal reports ""The acquisition comes as grocery sales have risen amid the Covid-19 pandemic with lockdowns keeping people cooking at home instead of dining out according to JLL’s recent Grocery Tracker report. Many investors still have eyes on grocery-anchored retail centers the report said. Though the volume of single-asset transactions valued over $5 million dropped 55.1% in 2020 pricing fell just 1.8% the JLL report said.”

“Covid-19 has had little impact on pricing as investors across the spectrum see grocery-anchored centers as a safe investment. Grocery centers typically show strong performances during down markets and this was certainly the case during 2020” JLL researchers James Cook and Taylor Coyne wrote in the grocery report. “Single-tenant grocery assets and grocery-anchored retail under 100000 square feet will be one of the most sought-after asset classes during the recovery.”

Quincy-based Stop & Shop is a division of Ahold Delhaize USA Inc.

The highway is one of the longest in the country as it starts in Florida and travels north along the East Coast going through 15 states for 1908 miles to the Canada border in Maine. But in Philadelphia the I-95 runs along the Delaware River past the Girard Point Bridge the sports complex and the Navy Yard. The highway then turns north and runs under the Walt Whitman Bridge past the decommissioned SS United States which once held the Blue Riband as the fastest transatlantic ocean liner. The highway then travels past Penn’s Landing and under the Benjamin Franklin Bridge where it turns to the northeast to head towards Trenton and New York City.

First we look at the sports complex with its Live! Casino and Hotel Lincoln Financial Field Citizens Bank Park and Xfinity Live! dominating the view when driving from the east to the west. In the foreground we see the small businesses that crowd the area to the east of the stadiums and in the background we can observe the entire skyline from the hospital buildings of University City to the dominant towers of Center City all the way to the Society Hill towers. From here we get a great sense of progress as the city’s physical image is changing in a dramatic way not seen in a long time.

Many of the major projects that were proposed over nearly two years ago are making significant progress. One of the most significant projects on the list is the 542-foot-tall 47-story Arthaus condominium at 311 South Broad Street which has topped out its concrete core and roof which nears the height of the William Penn statue atop City Hall. Cladding has been racing to the top and now rises to the first terrace of the skyscraper. The tower is planned to open by the end of next year.

The second major development that can be seen is the 599-foot Laurel Rittenhouse Square at 1911 Walnut Street which is just now popping into the skyline as the tower is now over 300 feet. The building’s structure is over halfway up and the final shape of the tower is starting to take form as the floor plates push back from Walnut Street above the 27th floor which will be situated for amenity space. The glass and stone rises up to the 16th floor and the crane is sticking out of the skyline nearly as much as Arthaus’ crane.

As the buildings positions change while driving fast along the highway the two tower Riverwalk project at 60 North 23rd Street can be seen as well with the north tower long topped out and the 363-foot south tower on its way up to block the 315-foot north tower from this view. The structure will soon stand 32 stories tall and the glass and metal cladding has just started installation last month with the glass now on the fifth floor.

Manila Philippines – In the past week little charitable grocery booths have sprouted on street corners and alleys all over the Philippines offering free food to needy people and soliciting donations from anyone willing to give them as many families in the country go hungry during the extended COVID-19 lockdown.

“Give what you can afford take what you need” read the signs on each booth which organisers call “community pantry”.

The movement helped along by social media has gone viral in the archipelago whose economy now languishes because of the pandemic.

The economy contracted by an unprecedented 9.5 percent in 2020 due to intermittent lockdowns causing many businesses to close.

In February some 4.2 million Filipinos were unemployed according to government data which also predicted that up to 17.5 percent of the country’s 110 million people will remain poor this year.

When Winnie Rayos Dimanlig a local government employee in Manila read a Facebook post about the first community pantry in a nearby district she also decided to start one right away.

“The beauty of the community pantry is in its simplicity. You have a cart there you fill it with food that anybody needing to tide over their hunger can just take from and anyone who has in excess can add to” Dimanlig told Al Jazeera.

She told her friends about the idea and donations came in. On Monday Dimanlig opened her community pantry in front of her house with rice vegetables fruit meat tinned goods and other basic food items stacked on small tables and shelves on the sidewalk.

Hundreds queued up

Hundreds of poor people queued up for a turn to pick from the items on offer. On Saturday Dimanlig counted at least 700 people who came to her community pantry.

At first her friends worried about their stocks running out but they were stunned by how fast donations kept pouring in many from strangers.

“We’ve had people drive by just to drop off their contributions. There are more donations now from people I don’t even know” Dimanlig said.

Dimanlig’s community pantry is one of at least 350 similar efforts started by common people in different parts of the Philippines. There is even one in East Timor supported by the local Filipino community.

‘Tired of inaction’

It all began on April 14 when Ana Patricia Non a young furniture designer and businesswoman left a wooden cart stacked with food on a street corner in a university village in Manila.

Passersby initially hesitated to take stuff from the cart – it seemed too good to be true and the needy tend to be ashamed of their poverty. Non had to assure them there was no catch and they really did not have to pay for what they would take.

“I am tired of complaining. I am tired of inaction” Non told the Manila-based news website Rappler when her community pantry started drawing public attention.

“This community pantry became a way to prove to ourselves that we can help one another and we are able to organise ourselves” she added during a media conference.

The Philippine government has been widely criticised by experts and citizens for its tepid response to the pandemic. President Rodrigo Duterte recently called the crisis “a small thing” even as COVID infections reached record numbers.

On Friday the health department reported 8719 new infections and a total caseload of almost 980000. The country’s COVID death toll crossed 16500.

To stave off the new wave of infections Manila and its surrounding provinces have been put on lockdown yet again. Daily wage earners who do odd jobs are unable to make a living but the government has capped financial aid for them at $20 per individual saying social welfare funds have run out.

Many Filipinos saw the community pantries as an inadvertent indictment of the government’s “inaction”.

“There is so much darkness not just because of the pandemic but how this pandemic is being addressed and all the problems attendant to it. It’s just – we need to do something” said Dimanlig.

Dindo Manhit president of Stratbase ADR Institute think-tank told Al Jazeera that people are no longer waiting for the government’s action but have taken the initiative to do their own part.

Communist propaganda?

But what Non said about “complaining” and “inaction” on the pandemic may have offended the government.

“That can be seen as a political statement” Manhit said.

Days after Non’s initiative attracted popular attention the government’s military-led anti-communist task force started “checking the background” of organisers.

Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade Jr the spokesman of the agency said some community pantries were distributing leaflets containing anti-government propaganda.

“They distribute food and with it is the poison of hate and mistrust towards a government that is ceaseless and faithful in its service to the Filipino people. This is simply not right and in defense of our people and State must be corrected” Parlade said in a statement on Tuesday.

Al Jazeera sought further comment from Parlade but he did not immediately respond to the query.

Although the general has yet to show evidence of his claims government social media platforms have carried his statements. The local police unit that covers Non’s community pantry later posted a warning on its social media pages claiming that the organisers had links to the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines. The post has since been deleted.

The government’s response to the citizen-based action quickly sparked fear among organisers who feared for their lives. Non was forced to briefly suspend her project fearing for her safety and that of her fellow volunteers.

The Duterte administration has been pushing to stamp out the country’s five-decade-old communist armed uprising and Parlade’s office has been going after groups and personalities it perceives as communist sympathisers.

With echoes of Duterte’s deadly “war on drugs” the anti-communist campaign also referred to as “Red-tagging” has seen dozens of activists and human rights lawyers killed in vigilante-style attacks in the last two years.

Although Duterte presented himself as pro-communist when he campaigned for the presidency in 2016 he has since antagonised the communist party and other leftist groups following failed attempts at peace negotiations.

Duterte’s government now considers the communist party a “terrorist organisation” and a new law condemns supporters of such groups as being “terrorists” too.

“In all honesty I have no links to the communist party. I am sorry but that question is so malicious” Non said when she was asked to comment on Parlade’s allegations.

“I’ve said that I’m disappointed with the [government’s] response. It’s true. I know that the government is working but in my opinion it falls short because people won’t stand in line that long if they’re getting enough support” she added.

‘Why put malice?’

Non and several other community pantry organisers reported having been approached and questioned by police some bearing firearms.

Police officers also came to Dimanlig’s community pantry on Tuesday asking for details about its organisers. Worried that she was under scrutiny too Dimanlig phoned her local police chief who told her they only wanted to ensure health protocols were being followed and they were not profiling her.

Outraged by the government’s response many Filipinos voiced their support for Non and the community pantry movement on social media. They slammed the government for getting in the way of a good thing.

Manhit said he found the accusation of communist links laughable because community pantries are out in the open and so far there has been no evidence of illegal activity.

“Why put malice into it? When you are not violating any law of the land whatever your political ideology is you are protected by your rights as a Filipino citizen enshrined in our constitution” Manhit said.

Zena Bernardo Non’s mother said she saw the backlash from the government coming. An activist herself Bernardo had a run-in with police in May 2020 when she organised a community kitchen. Police arrested her volunteers because their truck bore a placard with a message critical of the government.

Bernardo said the clampdown on community pantries might discourage people from trying to help their communities.

“Don’t bother to help because they might suspect you’re a rebel or terrorist” Bernardo told Al Jazeera. “Does it mean kindness is an act of terrorism now?”

Senator Joel Villanueva reacted to NTF-Elcac spokesperson Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade Jr.’s remark in an interview over One News’ The Chiefs last Tuesday where the military official likened the Maginhawa Community Pantry to Satan’s apple.https://t.co/t0ZKT7MTfl pic.twitter.com/iDCF9166rs — Inquirer (@inquirerdotnet) April 22 2021

‘Kindness is everyone’s colour’

The tide has since turned for Non and community pantries after the anti-communist task force’s statements backfired.

A group of senators spoke defending Non and proposed to defund the anti-communist task force which received a budget equivalent to $390m this year.

Duterte’s office which earlier praised community pantries distanced itself from Parlade’s statements and said it would caution the general against making clumsy statements.

“Kindness is everyone’s colour. Whatever one’s convictions are if they’re sincerely helping others we will support them Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said in a statement.

Non has reopened her community pantry with more vendors and displaced business owners offering to help. She said it will remain open as long as donations keep coming.

The same goes for Dimanlig’s community pantry.

“It promotes kindness. It promotes the idea that you are supposed to be responsible for your fellow human beings especially now” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluaWouY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjUvd2F0Y2gtbG9nYW4td2ViYi1oaXRzLWZpcnN0LXRyaXBsZS1ieS1hLXNmLWdpYW50cy1waXRjaGVyLXNpbmNlLXRpbS1saW5jZWN1bS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJpbmlqLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L3dhdGNoLWxvZ2FuLXdlYmItaGl0cy1maXJzdC10cmlwbGUtYnktYS1zZi1naWFudHMtcGl0Y2hlci1zaW5jZS10aW0tbGluY2VjdW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Logan Webb hits first triple by a SF Giants pitcher since Tim Lincecum,"When Logan Webb stepped into the batter’s box at Oracle Park on Sunday Giants pitchers were 0-for-29 with 20 strikeouts and no walks on the season.

The Giants’ pitching staff is a walking advertisement for the designated hitter but with one loud swing Webb reminded fans of the rare sense of joy that follows when a pitcher helps himself out at the plate.

With Marlins right-hander Paul Campbell behind in the count 3-0 the reliever tossed a fastball down the middle that Webb drilled into the right center field gap for a two-run triple. The ball left Webb’s bat with a 109.0 mile per hour exit velocity making it one of the hardest-hit balls by a Giants player this season.

It’s almost always a good sign when Giants pitchers are mentioned in the same sentence as Tim Lincecum and that’s what happened when Webb raced around the basepaths to reach third. His triple was the first by a Giants pitcher since Lincecum hit one on June 21 2013 against Ricky Nolasco of the Marlins at Oracle Park.

The rest of the developed world likely has a similar usage pattern. While this speaks a lot about how addicted we are to our phones the more concerning fact is that we often use our phones in places that are germ havens such as the bathroom in the kitchen and other places where bacteria thrive.

Several studies and surveys suggest our phones are seven times dirtier than the average toilet. That’s more than just disgusting — it’s a true health hazard. This is especially true as the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe.

The World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared the novel coronavirus (known officially as COVID-19) a pandemic in March 2020. While the end of the pandemic now seems to be in sight you should still not forget about cleaning your phone! Unless you’re extremely fastidious about washing your hands odds are you’re bringing all sorts of nasty germs to your phone. While the odds of coronavirus hanging on your phone isn’t likely to be high unless you are in areas with major outbreaks it’s not worth the risk.

Below we take a look at some tips on how to clean your phone to prevent viruses and other germs from hanging around.

Editor’s note: Most of these tips will apply to other electronic devices like tablets and laptops but also be sure to check out our guide on how to clean a computer screen.

Disinfectant wipes are okay but most household cleaners aren’t a good idea

You might think you already know how to clean your phone after all isn’t it just a matter of grabbing a household cleaner and going to town on it? Household cleaners might be great for counters bathrooms and other surfaces but are often too harsh to be used on most phones. This includes bleach glass cleaner and other similar products. Recently Apple and a few other OEMs confirmed it is okay to use products like Clorox sheets to disinfect your phone. These products typically use less harsh chemicals than spray bottles and the like. Another good idea might be ZEISS mobile screen wipes. These won’t work quite as well as Clorox sheets but they will be much safer for your phone.

Smartphone makers confirmed it is okay to use products like Clorox sheets to disinfect your phone

You might be tempted to consider using a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. This is an effective solution but keep in mind it can be hard on a phone’s protective oleophobic coating and may end up doing damage that shortens your phone’s lifespan. If you do feel the need to use alcohol make sure it’s on a cloth as opposed to directly on the phone. Even better as we’ll mention below use screen protectors and cases which are okay to use most of these chemicals on.

In addition here are some more general tips to know when disinfecting your smartphone. Don’t submerge your phone or gadgets in cleaning liquids even if they’re waterproof.

Avoid excessive wiping or abrasive cloths that may cause scratches.

Avoid bleach aerosol sprays and strong rubbing alcohols. These will damage your phone’s coatings particularly on glass.

Don’t spray cleaners or compressed air directly onto your gadgets.

A microfiber cloth is one of the safest ways to clean your phone

We have a tendency to simply grab any paper towel and clean our smartphones superficially. While this generally works it’s not the best way to wipe a smartphone down as it tends to miss a lot of bacteria and it may end up scratching your phone in the process! Plus most paper napkins and towels release lint fibers and other particles. These can then make their way in between buttons gaps and other parts that will later be hard to clean.

You can buy microfiber anywhere really. They are usually in pharmacies and eyeglass stores but you can also score some neat deals on Amazon. For example here’s a 6-pack of microfiber cloths for under $10.

Once you have a microfiber cloth simply wipe the screen and the rest of the phone in straight lines until all the noticeable residue comes off. If you are having trouble removing a tough stain or smudge spray a bit of distilled water onto the cloth and wipe again. If you feel you must you can use a mild soap solution on the cloth or even a half-and-half mixture of 70% isopropyl alcohol and water but again remember it might not break your phone but it could end up hurting it in the longer-term.

Dig into those hard-to-reach spots with cotton swabs

Cleaning the overall surface of your smartphone is easy but those pesky germs and annoying particles always go and get between buttons and tiny gaps. You can use a cotton swab for this. The concept is the same as with the wipes; don’t get the swabs wet unless you feel it’s absolutely necessary. If you do need some liquid try to keep it to a minimum. Don’t just soak the cotton swab and go at it.

Don’t go without a screen protector or case

Screen protectors and cases aren’t just good for preventing damage to your phone they are also often easier to clean. For example you don’t have to be quite as picky about using alcohol and other cleaning solutions on a screen protector. If it starts to take on damage you can throw it away and replace it. Often plastic screen protectors even come in packs of three or more so it’s not a big deal to remove one and add another.

When it comes to cases we highly recommend something that is made of an easy to wash material like plastic as opposed to fabric or wood-based cases that may end up severely damaged if washed.

As for cleaning screen protectors and cases? Most of the methods above will work just fine for screen protectors. For cases you can actually remove them and wash them manually with dish soap and other solutions. Dry them off and they are ready to be put back on!

Don’t forget to wash your hands often

Okay so this tip doesn’t help you clean your phone but it can help it from getting as dirty from the get-go. No special secrets here just use soap or dish soap anytime you have touched a dirty surface went to the restroom touched a pet and so forth. Read more: How to keep your laptop keyboard clean

While we are at it it’s also strongly advised that you stop being “that person” using your phone while literally on the toilet. Yes I know most of us do it even if not all of us will admit it. But especially during a pandemic it’s best to keep it as sanitary as possible.

Will rinsing your phone off help?

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

If you have a water-resistant phone rated for IP67 or higher you can rinse it with water. That said water alone doesn’t do much (if anything) for germs and viruses. It’s tempting to also use a light soap but remember soap can slowly work away at special coatings on a phone’s glass front and back as well as any rubber gaskets and sealings keeping the water out of your phone. So it’s best to avoid this as it will potentially hurt your phone in the long-term. Not to mention soap getting into your ports is likely not going to end well.

A UV phone sanitizer MIGHT be worth looking into

Ultraviolet lights (UV) are able to kill bacteria and disinfect your phone in just minutes. Most UV cleaning devices work a bit like tanning beds. You lock your phone in the case and it does it’s thing. While this might seem like the easiest solution it’s worth noting that these devices haven’t been tested to work on COVID-19 whereas more conventional cleaning solutions will certainly work. The best and most popular UV phone sanitizer is the PhoneSoap V3.

Since the Covid-19 outbreak a whole crop of third-party solutions have shown up on Amazon. Be sure to check the reviews to make sure you are getting the best product for the money. One of the best-reviewed products comes from no less than Samsung which has a UV phone sanitizer that also works as a Qi-based wireless phone charger.

So that’s a look at just a few tips on how to clean and disinfect your phone and hopefully another tool in your arsenal against the coronavirus and other germs.

Any Coca-Cola connoisseur like myself can taste the distinct difference between The One True Cola and Pepsi. One tastes like a refined drug the other is just brown carbonated sugar water. Don’t even get me started on why Coca-Cola that comes in a glass bottle (sold as “Mexican Coke” here in the U.S.) is superior to Coke in a can or plastic bottle. I will argue until your mouth hurts.

Recently I have been downing a few too many cans of Coca-Cola with Coffee. This exotic mix of cola and coffee is not new. About half a lifetime ago (for me at least) Coca-Cola released Coca-Cola Blāk but it was discontinued only two years later. In 2017 Coca-Cola with Coffee launched in Australia — I totally forgot that I got my first sip in Japan that same year — and I never heard about it ever again.

A few weeks ago I was at my local Asian supermarket (superior to American supermarkets in every conceivable way IMO) and there on the shelf was a 4-pack of Coca-Cola with Coffee. Now $7 is a lot of money for four 12-ounce cans of soda — it’s a terrible value compared to the bulk mega-sized 2-liter+ bottles you can buy at Target. But like I said I’m a man of fine Coca-Cola so I splurged.

That was a big mistake.

Because the first 4-pack turned into a second 4-pack the following week and then two more four-packs (one with Vanilla blend) and now not only am I addicted to them like Fry guzzling Slurm but I’ve got my sisters and friends hooked on them. I am so sorry guys.

Not a mistake is the taste. The regular Dark Blend is a combination of Coca-Cola with a kick of black coffee. Whereas Coca-Cola Blāk was good but smelled like some funky Chinese herbal medicine (you never forget that stuff) this new Coca-Cola with Coffee really tastes like a shot of espresso dropped into a glass of Coke. It is my new caffeinated and non-alcoholic alternative to sake and soju bombs that I unfortunately am not able to partake in at bars these days.

There’s a “zero sugar” version but unless you get a note from your doctor... that’s weaksauce. Drink water if you can’t handle sugar.

When I told my coworkers about my newfound addiction I was informed people in Europe — specifically Italy — have been mixing Coca-Cola and real coffee for an eternity to great results that may or may not twist your brain for better or worse. Of course they have — those classy bastards.

In moderation there is no non-alcoholic beverage that gives me this kind of buzz.

I am way too afraid of mixing two highly caffeinated beverages together for fear it’ll be more potent than this pre-made concoction. One day though! Maybe when I’ve hit rock bottom and need to pull myself up in this apathetic world.

For me Coca-Cola with Coffee once or twice a week is the high-flying rush that I used to get from chugging a Red Bull. I mean I’m pretty proud of all the reviews we’ve published in April and that is partially thanks to this drink running through my veins at ungodly hours. Okay maybe don’t be like me because I’m sure my doctor would yell at me. In moderation though there is no non-alcoholic beverage that gives me this kind of buzz. The only problem I have is that I can’t find the Caramel-flavored one in stores.

Inflation is coming. Look no further than Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble sharing plans this week to raise prices to offset rising commodity costs. The costs of raw materials ranging from lumber to resin are surging so companies are taking steps to protect profits. The price increases follow a year of surging demand for a host of items from paper towels to jars of peanut butter. Sales of consumer packaged goods rose 9.4% to $1.53 trillion last year according to the Consumer Brands Association. Many manufacturers pulled back on advertising and promotions as they tried to keep up with demand gaining market share without much marketing. ING Chief International Economist James Knightley is forecasting consumer prices will continue to rise in the near term and could gain almost 4% by May compared with the same time a year ago. The consumer price index which tracks how much U.S. consumers pay for a basket of goods rose 2.6% in March from the year-ago period according to the Department of Labor.

Inventories are 'too low'

Low inventory is helping companies flex their pricing power he said. ""According to the Institute for Supply Management their latest survey showed a net 40% of manufacturers are reporting that their customer inventories are 'too low'"" Knightley said. ""This offers more evidence that corporate pricing power is strengthening.""

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards

Food industry analyst Phil Lempert said numerous factors have increased costs for farmers that pick produce factories that make consumer packaged goods and meatpacking plants that process beef pork and chicken. Ports are congested truck drivers are in short supply and food workers must try to socially distance. That's made it harder to keep up with demand and get items from grains to Italian cheeses shipped across the globe.

Price hikes get stealthy

Moody's analyst Linda Montag said that she doesn't view higher prices as a competitive advantage because all consumer companies are facing higher commodity costs. Besides Coke and P&G PepsiCo  Kimberly-Clark  General Mills and J.M. Smucker have addressed raising prices. And consumers might not even notice that they're paying more for diapers or soda. ""Consumer companies across the board have gotten very savvy about how to implement price increases without just slapping on five to 10% price increases"" Montag said in an interview. Some of those methods include using new packaging selling smaller-size packs for the same price or offering promotions that bring the price down until consumers are used to the higher sticker price. Hedging positions may also give some manufacturers like Coke and Pepsi more flexibility to raise their prices gradually because they won't feel the impact of higher commodity costs for several quarters.

More cash in consumer pockets means less risk

Hiking prices always carries a risk that demand for those products will fall. However Moody's analyst Chedly Louis said that she isn't expecting consumers to trade down to private label products because consumers put their trust in bigger brands during the crisis. That behavior is expected to stick around longer. ""There's a potential for the consumer to trade down within P&G's product portfolio to cheaper lower margin products. It's still P&G but it's cheaper"" Louis said. Many consumers also have more cash in their wallets from government stimulus checks and foregoing travel sports games and fine dining for year. Not all companies have the same flexibility to raise prices. Piper Sandler downgraded Kraft Heinz stock on Friday citing the company's relatively weak pricing power as one reason for the decision. Analyst Michael Lavery wrote that the company's pricing power lags behind that of peers like General Mills  Mondelez and Hershey  so hiking prices could hurt demand.

Discounts are rare

Most retailers will pass on the higher prices to consumers. Lempert said that grocers are juggling pricier services like online grocery delivery or curbside pickup leaving little room in profit margins to absorb higher food costs. The cost of groceries had already been rising as retailers offered fewer discounts while shoppers cleared shelves last spring and bought more cooking supplies than usual in the months that followed. Phil Tedesco vice president of retail intelligent analytics for NielsenIQ said in a typical month 31.5% of units are sold on promotion. In March only 28.6% of units were sold on promotion. ""This has led to shoppers having fewer opportunities to take advantage of sales in the store and as a result the total cost of grocery products has increased slightly"" he said. J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman wrote in a note to clients on Monday that higher prices will help food retailers particularly as they face tough comparisons to last year's skyrocketing demand. ""Too much inflation is bad for grocers but an incremental 2-3% (roughly the percentage the producers need to pass through) with a mix shift toward higher-priced products is probably very helpful right now"" he said. —CNBC's Melissa Repko contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rbGFob21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZXN0eWxlLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvbGVhdmUtZXRlcm5hbC1sZWdhY3ktb2tsYWhvbWEtcHJheWVyLWV2ZW50LXNwZWFrZXItc2F5cy83Mjk3MjkxMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leave an 'eternal legacy' Oklahoma prayer event speaker says,"The businessman remembered the phone call from his son vividly as if it occurred only yesterday.

Frank Harrison III's son James was working with Samaritan's Purse to help people in Sudan Africa who were facing intense persecution because of their Christian faith. The younger man's urgent plea to his father was heartfelt.

""He began calling me saying 'Dad we've got to help these people'"" Harrison said at the recent virtual 2021 CBMC Metro Prayer Breakfast in Oklahoma City.

The chairman and chief executive officer of Charlotte North Carolina-based Coca-Cola Consolidated said he and his son eventually founded a nonprofit humanitarian organization called Open Eyes to train and equip pastors in different parts of the world and to offer other aid as well.

Harrison said his son died in 2010 in Kenya but his ""eternal legacy"" lives on in all of the people he helped and connected to Christ before he passed away.

""I do believe James did his part"" the businessman said in his keynote speech for the prayer event on Wednesday. The event was the 37th annual prayer breakfast hosted by the Christian Business Men's Connection of Oklahoma.

Several Oklahoma leaders shared remarks and led prayers before Harrison gave the keynote address. Gov. Kevin Stitt U.S. Sen. James Lankford Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt and business leaders Marty Hepp Thomas Hill III and Steve Green all shared remarks.

Brent Vawter senior area director for CBMC-Oklahoma said all of the participants including Harrison gathered at the new Omni Hotel to tape their segment of the prayer event.

He said people responded favorably to CBMC-Oklahoma's first online-only prayer event.

""Feedback continues to be really positive. So many people have reached out to us talking about Frank’s message on purpose and legacy as well as the prayers prayed by Steve Green Thomas Hill James Lankford and Marty Hepp"" Vawter said.

In his presentation Harrison focused on encouraging his audience to consider their purpose and eternal legacy as they build their careers and go about their everyday lives.

He said doing things purposely and building an eternal legacy were concepts behind his decision to have chaplains at his business sites and in implementing an organization that offers ways that employees may serve out in their communities and other places in need.

""You're going to die one day. What is your legacy going to be?"" he said.

The business leader said he remembered wondering what good would ever come of losing his son. He had hoped that his son would join him in the family business and become the fifth generation in a family of Coca-Cola business leaders.

Harrison said he found solace in God's word specifically Romans 8:18 and Romans 8:28 which says that all things work together for good for those that love the Lord and who are called according to His purpose.

He said Open Eyes which benefited from his son's leadership has equipped more than 1000 individuals to be ""mobile messengers for Christ"" started 26000 churches and helped lead more than 390000 people to make decisions for Christ.

""I'm so thankful that God let James have a powerful legacy really an eternal legacy ... which is through Christ"" he said.

""We're discovering over time that God knows best that He can be trusted and His plan is best.""

What they said

Here are some of the remarks from other speakers who participated in the virtual event praying for Oklahoma businesses and business leaders elected leaders cities and communities around the state and nation.

U.S. Sen. James Lankford:

Father I do pray that you would give wisdom to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that you would help them and their teams to be able to know you to be able to submit to your leadership and to be able walk with you. Father I pray that you would be the unseen leader in our White House and among the agencies.

Thomas Hill III chief executive officer of Kimray: Father we thank you for bringing Oklahoma City and the state of Oklahoma through this past year. We bless your name for the prosperity you have given us throughout our history and the way you have sustained us even in lean times. We thank you Lord for the spirit you have given our people to persevere in the face of hardship to be kind and generous when others are in need and to find joy in the days you have given us. We ask Father that you would be present in our city and state and that you would renew the ties of mutual regard which form our civic life. We desire that your spirit would be at work to root out prejudice and oppression from our hearts and that in its place you would bring peace among us and between us.

Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt: It's good to be back together after a year apart. And though meeting virtually is not ideal it does allow us to reach an even broader audience this morning. ... What a year. What a time in our city's life this has been. The worst pandemic in a century the worst recession since 2009 the most consequential racial reckoning since the 1960s the worst ice storm since 2007 the worst snow storm since 2009 the worst cold snap in decades. All of this in a 12-month period. Even in the face of all these challenges God has been good to Oklahoma City. That's because as they say God is good all the time.

Code Gladiators begins its 2021 quest with Cognizant,"His superb coding skills and tactical thinking helped him claim victory over 2.52 Lakh coders. Even before he could start working at a Bengaluru-based tech firm his seniors recognised him quickly as ‘the Code Gladiators’ champion’. “Code Gladiators created a smooth walking ground for me at my first job otherwise it would have been difficult to stand out among so many new joinees” he recollected with a resolve to repeat his victory this year too.

New Delhi [India] April 24 (ANI/TechGig): Exactly a year ago IIT-BHU graduate Himanshu Singh participated in the world’s biggest code competition Code Gladiators not knowing where he stood among the lakhs of technologists.

His story is similar to that of Maninder Pal Singh who won the inaugural edition of Code Gladiators. He too was a freshman at a software firm when he participated at Code Gladiators in 2014. He beat 36000-odd coders and this victory gained him overnight fame at his firm and helped him unlock better career prospects. Today he is working as a senior software developer in Sydney Australia and living his dream there. Something similar happened to Vineet Paliwal in 2018 – then a director with a multinational firm – who beat 2.28 Lakh coders at Code Gladiators. He bagged an elevated role at India’s biggest digital firm after his Code Gladiators win. Today he is an investor and director in a Pune-based software company.

These names and faces change year after year but the story of zesty coders giving in all their skills hopes and might turn their careers around remain a constant at Code Gladiators. This is an annual pedestal for lakhs of coders to benchmark their skills network with peers from different companies meet industry leaders and steer their career in a new direction. The event has been lauded by the Limca and the Guinness Book of World Records for maximum participation in 2015 and 2017 respectively.

TechGig Code Gladiators opened its 2021 edition recently with cognizant one of the world’s leading professional services companies for the digital era as its presenting partner. Last year 2.52 lakh coders including a dozen coding masters from the US Italy Singapore Ireland Germany Russia Norway and Bangladesh participated in the contest.

Presently three themes are live: UiPath RPA Hackathon Bosch AI Hackathon and Times Internet’s Machine Learning. Other than this participants can also register for the open coding round. The competition has already garnered more than 54000 registrations in the first 30 days. The event will end with a virtual career fair where all participating companies will recruit from the competition participants.

Commenting on the Code Gladiators 2021 edition Sanjay Goyal Business Head TimesJobs and TechGig said “Code Gladiators is perfect talent discovery and benchmarking platform for the corporates. Finding competent developers – especially in niche technologies – is tedious and time taking. Here the corporates get to see thousands of coders live in action working on new-age technologies collaborating with peers to present unique solutions to hackathon problems. For developers Code Gladiators is the annual fest where they can benchmark their skills assess where they stand against their peers and understand the industry dynamics. All these are vital to catapult your career to a higher level. I’m elated to announce that this year Cognizant one of the world’s leading professional services companies for the digital erais the presenting partner for Code Gladiators.”

Allen Shaheen EVP and Digital Engineering Head at Cognizant said “In times of breakneck technological changes highly competitive talent markets and diverse job requirements problem-solving and programming skills command a premium. As a global professional services company engineering solutions to solve some of the world’s most difficult engineering and social challenges.

Just like its sister formal sector the informal Sector is a multi‐faceted sector comprising of different sectors or markets that engages in diverse activities that are king in generating business cash flows. It can include – but not necessarily be limited to ‐ informal trading activities informal labor markets informal financial sectors and informal corporate or business sectors. Uganda’s informal sector economy is a giant virgin banking space yet relatively very little is known about it by most players in financial banking industry.

The informal sector right here in Uganda has been mistaken by many players in the financial banking industry much of their understanding of the informal sector is narrow they think of the informal sector as ONLY a segment of small enterprises usually individually operated such as vendors on the down town streets Kampala like Kisseka Owino markets sub-urban and other remote areas. While it is certainly true that most informal sector activities in Uganda are on a very small scale the informal sector in Uganda is in fact far more complex and encompasses some large operators that players in the banking industry could take opportunity of but surprisingly very few players are willing to take that sense of strategic direction.

The informal sector is a major source of employment and livelihood globally and interacts closely with the formal sector. Given its importance “banking players in other countries are paying increasing attention to the informal sector in collecting financial and other related economic data.” Informal sector activities are a major part of the overall economy in developing economies and deserve attention for a number of reasons.

First the informal sector in developing economies is estimated to be contributing around 40‐50 percent of official GDP (Schneider et al. 2010) to their respective national economies. Secondly the informal sector absorbs about 60% of the labor force engaged in non‐agricultural activities in many developing countries (ILO 2012). Specifically for Uganda’s case over 50% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (UBOS 2014) is attributed to the informal sector up from 43% in 2002 and up to 80% of the country’s labor force is employed by the informal sector. This shows that various economic agents working in the informal sector contribute extensively to the overall economic activity of Uganda’s economy.

Much as such high levels of informality can achieve a significant impact on productivity and growth of an economy like Uganda’s the informal sector Uganda just like it is elsewhere is in most cases stigmatized as troublesome and unmanageable this has motivated most players in Uganda’s banking industry except a few to shy away from financing the informal sector productive activities citing and paying more attention to uncertainty and risk associated with financing the informal sector productive activities as opposed to being cognizant of the significant contribution of the informal sector to the Uganda’s collective GDP basket.

Bank financing and an economy’s economic growth are synonymous financing is an economic launchpad that propels into motion various informal sector productive economic activities. Much as most players in the banking industry are only striving to tap into the already known and established clientele space in the formal sector such players in financial industry are in fact forgetful of the fact that the informal sector is economic mine that has birthed forth all the SME and Corporate clientele segments the banking players are proud of today.

Interestingly players in Uganda’s commercial banking year in & year out are always flexing to acquire and maintain the very few high-end SME and Corporate clients from other competition banks within the same industry through buy-offs motivated by a minor step-down in the prime lending rates and other relaxed banking and lending covenants This finally informs my conclusion that players in the banking industry are just in business of recycling “same names” of SME and corporate clients aided with buy-offs between banks instead of going out to profile and book new business deals existent within the informal sector today that can stand tall in their asset books in the near future. Much as players in Uganda’s banking industry intentionally continue to pay zero or very little attention to economic activities carried outside the formal economic framework of Uganda’s economy its high time such players in the banking industry adjusted their sense of strategic direction and re-consider the urgent need to finance the informal sector activities because the informal sector comprises of productive activities that possess market value and would add to tax revenue and GDP of Uganda’s economy and yet most importantly financing such informal sector activities would translate in “generating business cash-flows” which is a financial indicator that such an informal sector business activity can be in position to repay the bank’s several lines of credit obligations (both principle & interest)

Players in the Uganda’s banking industry should be cognizant of the fact that the size of Uganda’s informal sector will decrease slowly as Uganda’s economy develops over time but this can only be achieved if the financing arm of players in Uganda’s industry is extended towards financing all productive informal sector activities.

According to my expert research the most strategic penetration approaches to successful informal sector financing are first is the financial capacity building & training approach investment club financing approach and the Sacco financing approach.

The future of banking in Uganda is in the space of the informal sector kindly embrace it.

The question is where do the Somalis who are now part and parcel of Kenyan population fit into that description. Also is Farmaajo is cognizant to the fact that his own brothers and sisters who live on the other side of the border will be by de facto — intentionally or unintentionally — be included in that category?

The same applies when Somalia speaks of cutting diplomatic ties with Kenya which also means cutting the Somali population inside Kenya who share a long border with Somalia.

Mogadishu’s move to stop khat trade between Kenya and Somalia also hurts the Somali businessmen in Kenya the same way it hurts the Ameru community and the Kenyan government. This is because they are also involved in all the steps of the trade from transportation to its sale in Somalia.

The actions of the Somalia government should have been a lot more different if it had considered the Somali population in Kenya before taking any drastic move against Nairobi.

The Kenyan government is even worse than Somalia when it comes to ignoring its own Somali population in making major decisions on Mogadishu.

Until recently Kenya has been hosting former Jubaland security minister Abdirashid Janan against the will of area residents and leaders.

Janan posed a serious security threat to the Somali population in Mandera because his war on Beledhawo always spilled over to the Kenyan side.

Janan later betrayed Kenya and deserted its ally Jubaland’s president Ahmed Madobe and joined hands with Farmajo in Mogadishu.

The hosting of Janan by Kenya against the wishes of its own population in the area can be regarded as utter contempt and disrespect which could only lead to mistrust.

Both the Somali and Kenyan governments should keep hardliners and hate mongering strategists from developing their foreign policies towards each another and engage their genuine citizenry who would put the interest of the two countries and their people before anything.

Differences between the two states should be solved soberly and when that is not possible they should seek support from friendly countries and institutions. But they should always draft their strategies while putting the Somali population (rightful citizens in Kenya and blood brothers to Somalia) into the equation.

Could they compete with Comcast and Verizon?,"Mark Arnold Telecommunications Director for Kutztown poses for a portrait in front of the historic train station in Kutztown Pa. on Friday April 23 2021. President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan aims to expand internet access by building more publicly-owned broadband networks. Kutztown runs one of 200 city-wide broadband networks across the country that offer internet service. Read more

The rural borough of Kutztown couldn’t convince companies to bring faster internet to its community. So the town about 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia built its own broadband network.

Since 2000 Kutztown’s 5000 residents can buy internet service from a municipal entity just like the water and electricity they purchase from borough utilities. The publicly-owned fiber optic network has not only provided improved download speeds but has also lowered prices the town says. A private company has since slashed its rates to compete it adds.

“Whether you subscribe to the service or not you’re still benefiting from its existence” said Mark Arnold the borough’s telecommunications director.

President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan aims to expand internet access by building more such community broadband networks. The Biden administration has called broadband “the new electricity” noting the federal government worked to bring power to nearly every home under President Franklin Roosevelt because it was crucial to the economy.

Biden’s internet proposal would override 19 state laws that restrict municipalities from competing with private providers including a law in Pennsylvania that passed after Kutztown already built its network.

Biden’s plan has renewed debate over whether municipal broadband makes the internet more affordable and accessible. Advocates including Democrats in Washington argue that public networks give internet titans like Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. much needed competition. That would drive down prices and create more options.

But critics including Republican lawmakers and the cable industry say the taxpayer-funded networks are unfair competition discourage private investment and are ill-equipped to keep pace with technology.

A University of Pennsylvania study found the public projects can be money-losing operations. And Philadelphia offers a cautionary tale about how municipal internet projects can fail.

The coronavirus crisis underscored the necessity for high-speed internet as governments closed schools and offices forcing Americans to stay home. Cities such as Philadelphia scrambled to connect low income families that did not have computers or internet.

According to the Biden administration over 30 million Americans live in areas without broadband infrastructure and millions more can’t afford it because the U.S. has higher broadband prices than other countries.

At the same time more than three-quarters (76%) of Americans believe that internet service is as important as water or electricity in today’s world according to a February survey by Consumer Reports a pro-consumer group.

‘Gig City’

Biden’s plan would spend $100 billion on broadband infrastructure prioritizing support for networks run by local governments cooperatives and nonprofits. The president believes such networks have less pressure to turn profits and can commit to serving entire communities an administration official said.

“Broadly speaking I think what the president wants to do is encourage more competition” said Bharat Ramamurti deputy director of the National Economic Council. “There are a lot of parts in this country where there’s only one maybe two internet providers in the area which means that oftentimes the price is high or service isn’t as high quality as it should be.”

Chattanooga Tenn. offers a broadband success story. The city’s electric power company deployed a fiber optic network a decade ago to deliver the internet and operate a smart grid.

The utility paid for the project with a $169 million bond issue and a $111 million grant from the Obama administration which wanted to stimulate the economy after the Great Recession.

The city has been dubbed “Gig City” for offering gigabit (1000 mbps) internet speeds. More recently PCMagazine called the city something else: the best city to work from home after the coronavirus forced consumers to work remotely.

The city-owned network has never raised its prices claims to have the world’s fastest speeds and has lured tech startups to the city. A recent study from the University of Tennessee said Chattnooga’s Hamilton County received $2.7 billion in economic benefits from the infrastructure including business investments and residential bill savings.

The public network’s primary competitors are Comcast and AT&T Inc. and it’s winning the market share battle. It serves 116000 customers out of about 170000 homes and businesses in its footprint according to J. Ed. Marston head of marketing for the utility EPB formerly called the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga.

For $58 a month EPB customers can get download and upload speeds of 300 megabits per second far exceeding the Federal Communications Commission’s minimum broadband requirements. It also offers 1000 mbps for $68 per month and 10000 mbps for $300 per month the latter plan it calls “the world’s fastest internet.”

“We have to charge enough for our services to make what we’re doing sustainable” Marston said. “But we’re community based so our focus is providing the best value the best pricing that we can.”

‘Oversold solution’

Municipal broadband models widely vary. While Chattanooga’s system is city-owned other towns have built then leased their infrastructure. Others have paid private firms to build and operate community networks.

In all about 200 cities offer such citywide internet service said Christopher Mitchell director of the community broadband networks program at the Institute for Local Self Reliance an advocacy group.

Although municipal broadband has worked in places such as Kutztown and Chattanooga taxpayers can be on the hook if the expensive projects don’t work out.

Christopher Yoo a University of Pennsylvania professor of law communications and computer science studied the financial viability of 20 municipal fiber networks. He found that 11 of 20 didn’t make enough cash to cover operating costs and just two were on track to pay off the total project costs during the 30- to 40-year useful life of the systems.

“Municipal broadband is often oversold as a solution” Yoo said. “Taxpayers are sort of told this is something for nothing that it’s going to make money for the city and it’s not really portrayed as a potential burden.”

The cable industry criticized Biden’s broadband plan for prioritizing the public sector. Republican lawmakers have introduced their own proposals including one that claims to promote competition by limiting government-run networks.

“The White House has elected to go big on broadband infrastructure but it risks taking a serious wrong turn in discarding decades of successful policy by suggesting that the government is better suited than private-sector technologists to build and operate the internet” said Michael Powell president and CEO of the NCTA also known as the Internet & Television Association.

Corporations such as Comcast have worked to close the digital divide with free and low-cost service.

The company offers a $10-per-month plan for low-income customers. In Philadelphia the cable giant has partnered with the city to connect thousands of families with free home internet during the pandemic and has equipped 50 community centers with free WiFi called “Lift Zones.”

But activists and elected officials note there are still gaps in the market with people unable to access or afford an increasingly important internet connection. They argue community networks can help.

“People appreciate that this is not easy. It’s hard work. And it’s not for every city” Mitchell said. “But it needs to be the cities that decide whether or not this is the right solution for them.”

Pennsylvania’s history with broadband

In 2004 Philadelphia planned to build the largest municipal WiFi grid in the country. The ambitious “Wireless Philadelphia” project drew worldwide acclaim and envisioned over 100000 people especially its poorest residents connecting to low-cost internet.

But the endeavor failed four years later when Earthlink the private company the city chose to build and run the network pulled the plug after spending $17 million and signing up just 6000 customers. Experts now say the wireless technology wasn’t ready for the moment and the city erred in handing ownership to a private firm to avoid spending tax dollars.

A lasting legacy of Philadelphia’s failed effort is a Pennsylvania law that limits municipal broadband. Sensing government competition Verizon and other internet incumbents successfully lobbied lawmakers in 2004 to largely bar local governments from providing broadband. The law prohibits localities from offering broadband “for compensation” if a company is already operating there unless the company refuses to offer internet speeds the city is seeking.

Pennsylvania was not the first state to restrict municipal broadband but it “really ignited the monopoly movement to try to prevent cities from building networks” said Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self Reliance

Kutztown’s fiber network launched four years before the state law and is grandfathered in. The public broadband provider now serves more than half of the borough’s roughly 2500 homes.

The biggest challenge of running the network? Competing with the lower prices suddenly offered by a private company once Kutztown launched its network. “When the price war started it wasn’t as profitable” Arnold said noting it took longer to pay off the building cost.

But the whole project was never meant to be a big moneymaker he added. “It was designed to bring the services to the residents that they needed.”

She and her staff at the county health department entered pandemic response mode and haven’t looked back–often working up to twelve-hour days with little time off.

“I feel I don’t even have time to reflect on the year” says Loveluck. In March as the department led local mass vaccination efforts and coordinated vaccination strategy it also marked the one-year anniversaries of the first confirmed Covid case in Washtenaw County and the first death of a county resident. By mid-month the confirmed and probable toll had reached 247 people.

Loveluck fifty-five says she credits her “dedicated and smart and caring and passionate staff” with “responding to so many phases and challenges of the pandemic.” More than a hundred ’employees–and scores of temporary workers who were hired to test trace investigate and ‘vaccinate–faced challenges from the initial test shortage to “the politicization of the pandemic” to “inequities which have been so amplified during the pandemic.”

As of mid-March the health department had given more than 30000 vaccine doses and was nearly finished offering K-12 school employees first doses in its partnership with IHA and Michigan Medicine. As vaccine supplies increase–and the state opens vaccine eligibility to every resident age sixteen or over starting April 5–the department is ramping up vaccination clinics at EMU Chelsea and community pop-ups and sending nurses to group homes and homebound seniors.

Loveluck works to ensure state guidelines are implemented and advocates at the state level for county needs. She’s one of just two health officers statewide appointed by Governor Whitmer to serve on the Protect Michigan Commission that promotes vaccine awareness and confidence.

“I’ve often said that becoming health officer is like drinking water from a fire hose” because of the multiple roles and responsibilities says Loveluck’s predecessor Ellen Rabinowitz. She says her former deputy “has a steely calm in the face of a really scary situation” and is “intentional” about developing relationships and collaborating with community partners.

“I’m very proud of the equity framework we’ve used in responding to Covid” Loveluck says. “We were the first local health department [in the state] to share Covid data by race or ethnicity and that showed the disproportionate impact in communities of color in certain parts of our county … That information was a call to action not only for the health department but for so many community partners and for our health systems to really come together in partnership and respond to these inequities.” The department recently launched a state pilot project that is sending an additional 2500 vaccine doses to high-need areas via pop-up clinics.

Loveluck’s first name pronounced “he-men-ah” reflects her own multicultural background. Her parents were born and raised in Chile and moved to the U.S. with her three older siblings in the mid-1960s. The youngest and the only child born in the U.S. Loveluck grew up bilingual in Ann Arbor graduated from Huron High and majored in English at the U-M. She considered careers in teaching and law before switching to social work and public health (her MSW is from Boston College).

“In all of those things that I thought about doing I think more and more of what formed for me was the importance of work in service to others” she says “and work in service of social justice. I grew up in a family that was very committed to issues of human rights and social justice.”

Although her family had left Chile before military dictator Augusto Pinochet seized power her parents knew people who were imprisoned or forced into exile by the regime. Her mother worked with organizations there to bring the stories of human rights abuses to the U.S. using colorful hand-stitched tapestries called arpilleras created by Chilean women. The artwork reflected the stories of the sons brothers and husbands who disappeared during the dictatorship. Her mother Eliana Moya-Raggio–who taught for nearly thirty years at U-M’s Residential ‘College–also sold the artwork to support the women. Two arpilleras hang on the wall in Loveluck’s office. They’re a reminder of the importance of human rights and she says “I very much think of public health as a human right.”

She met her husband Tim Veeser their freshman year at U-M. Now an attorney he’s been “incredibly supportive” during a tough year. “He’s a great cook–he feeds me” she laughs. “He’s also a great listener and encourages me and lets me vent.” They have a daughter in grad school in New York City studying to be a family nurse practitioner and a son who is a health care consultant in Chicago.

Loveluck started her public health career when she was in grad school answering phones at the Massachusetts AIDS Hotline and working as an HIV test counselor. “That was a time when there was very little treatment available” she recalls and there were “some very difficult conversations and experiences.” But she learned the importance of sharing “accurate information to respond as more information is learned and to also deal with stigma.” She brings those insights to her current job as she talks to the media gives regular video updates–some in Spanish–and provides constantly updated Covid data and health news on the department’s website.

She led the HIV/AIDS Resource Center (now UNIFIED) for seventeen years worked closely with the county health department in that position and was eventually appointed to the board of health. She saw a job with the health department as a “great way to think about a final stage of my career–continuing to work in service to others but having a more expansive focus on public health.”

“I don’t think people in their day-to-day lives thought much about public health or the work that the local department does because when we’re doing a good job and we’re preventing illness people don’t think of us. But I think this past year has … taught us the importance of investing in public health and also the importance of investing in preventive health.”

With the positivity rate in Washtenaw County at less than 2 percent and the influx of vaccines promised by the Biden administration “we’re going in the right direction” she says. But public health departments also are “racing against the variants” to control the virus before it evolves further.

Post-pandemic Loveluck hopes to have more time for walks bike rides and visits with friends. And like many people she’s looking forward to a long-awaited reunion: She hopes by October it will be safe for all of her siblings to get together to celebrate their mother’s ninetieth birthday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3dpbGwtZGFuaWVsLXdpbGNvLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLW9iaXR1YXJ5LXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1jYWJsZS1pbmR1c3RyeS0yMDIxMDQyNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Daniel cable television pioneer and founder of Wilco Electronics dies at 86,"Will Daniel 86 of Ambler the founder of Wilco Electronic Systems and a pioneer in the cable television business who helped the city of Philadelphia establish cable television died Sunday April 18.

Will Daniel 86 of Ambler the owner of Wilco Electronic Systems Inc. and a pioneer in establishing cable television in Philadelphia died Sunday April 18 at Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health surrounded by family.

His family said he had been actively working until a few weeks ago.

Mr. Daniel began Wilco an African American private cable company in May 1977.

In 1980 Home Box Office the leading pay-television service granted Wilco a franchise to market its programming to multi-dwelling buildings. This was the first time HBO had granted a franchise to a minority-owned company in the eastern United States Wilco said in a news release on Mr. Daniel’s death.

In the Wilco statement David Cohen former senior executive vice president of Comcast who now serves as a senior adviser to Comcast Corp. described Mr. Daniel as a “Philadelphia icon.”

“He was a visionary businessperson who never lost sight of the community from which he came. He was a real partner to Comcast helping our company to expand in Philadelphia and to take root in the African American community. His advice was always prescient. His friends at Comcast will miss him but more importantly all of us in Philadelphia will miss his leadership and commitment to making lives better.”

Before starting his own company Mr. Daniel had worked for Marco Video Systems Inc. for 19 years. It was at Marco that he began designing and building cable systems.

Because of his early experience with cable Mr. Daniel worked with the administration of former Mayor W. Wilson Goode Sr. in the early 1980s to develop Philadelphia’s cable franchising process where cable companies had to bid to provide service in four areas of the city.

He was a partner and minority owner with the Rollins Cablevision franchise and later received equity when Rollins was sold to Comcast Cablevision.

After the Rollins sale Mr. Daniel began a 40-year friendship with Ralph J. Roberts founder of Comcast. Because of that relationship Wilco and Comcast created a partnership model where low-cost cable services were made available to underserved and low-income communities in Philadelphia.

In 2001 Wilco became the exclusive provider of cable television services for the Philadelphia Housing Authority the company said.

In January 2018 Comcast acquired Wilco’s cable assets and invested in significant upgrades to Wilco’s infrastructure at PHA sites. Comcast now provides residents with access to Comcast Xfinity products including Internet Essentials its internet service for low-income families.

Wilco is now focused on installing low-voltage wiring and design for access control systems necessary for the concept of “smart homes.”

“We have pivoted our business to the foundation of what my father started” said Brigitte Daniel-Corbin CEO and president of Wilco.

But the wiring the company is installing today is for new technologies where physical objects are embedded with sensors and software so that lighting systems security cameras thermostats and other appliances can be controlled by smart phones.

She said she learned from her father about people and relationships and the importance of cultivating those relationships. She said integrity was a big part of his character. “He always talked about keeping your reputation strong and keeping it high.”

“As a father I loved him and he loved me dearly” Daniel-Corbin said. “I am so honored he instilled so much trust in the legacy of his business in me.”

Will Daniel was born in February 1935 in Roanoke Rapids N.C. to John and Mary Daniel. He was the ninth of 11 children. Daniel-Corbin said her father gained his work ethic from being part of the family’s farming business.

“What he learned was the importance of hard work” she said. “You get up early go work on the farm and then you go to school. That hard work ethic was what he brought to Philadelphia and he maintained those skills until his last weeks.”

After completing school Mr. Daniel served for three years in the Army where he began learning electronic and communications skills.

Upon leaving the Army in 1955 he returned to North Carolina before moving to Philadelphia the following year where Mr. Daniel studied electronics at a vocational school and then went to work for Marco Video Systems.

During his early years in Philadelphia Mr. Daniel married his first wife Victoria with whom he had two sons. That marriage ended amicably in a divorce his daughter said.

About the time he started Wilco he married his second wife Virginia Smith a Philadelphia schoolteacher. The couple had one daughter Daniel-Corbin. After 25 years that marriage also ended in an amicable divorce.

About 2006 he married his third wife Lucille.

Daniel-Corbin said her father maintained friendly relationships with his former wives and often brought all members of his family together for family functions.

For 40 years Mr. Daniel was an active member of Salem Baptist Church in Jenkintown. He later joined Bethlehem Baptist Church in Spring House.

In addition to his daughter wife Lucille and former spouses Mr. Daniel is survived by sons Darryl and Vance; six grandchildren; three great-grandchildren and other relatives and friends.

People may pay their respects to Mr. Daniel from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday April 29 at Bethlehem Baptist Church 712 Penllyn Pike Spring House..

A funeral service will be livestreamed on Friday April 30 starting at 9 a.m. at bbc4christ.org and bbandhodges.com.

BOSTON — A very strange thing happened on the internet the day President Joe Biden was sworn in. A shadowy company residing at a shared workspace above a Florida bank announced to the world’s computer networks that it was now managing a colossal previously idle chunk of the internet owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.

That real estate has since more than quadrupled to 175 million addresses — about 1/25th the size of the current internet.

""It is massive. That is the biggest thing in the history of the internet” said Doug Madory director of internet analysis at Kentik a network operating company. It’s also more than twice the size of the internet space actually used by the Pentagon.

After weeks of wonder by the networking community the Pentagon has now provided a very terse explanation for what it’s doing. But it has not answered many basic questions beginning with why it chose to entrust management of the address space to a company that seems not to have existed until September.

The military hopes to “assess evaluate and prevent unauthorized use of DoD IP address space” said a statement issued Friday by Brett Goldstein chief of the Pentagon's Defense Digital Service which is running the project. It also hopes to “identify potential vulnerabilities” as part of efforts to defend against cyber-intrusions by global adversaries who are consistently infiltrating U.S. networks sometimes operating from unused internet address blocks.

The statement did not specify whether the “pilot project” would involve outside contractors.

The Pentagon periodically contends with unauthorized squatting on its space in part because there has been a shortage of first-generation internet addresses since 2011; they now sell at auction for upwards of $25 each.

Madory said advertising the address space will make it easier to chase off squatters and allow the U.S. military to “collect a massive amount of background internet traffic for threat intelligence.”

Some cybersecurity experts have speculated that the Pentagon may be using the newly advertised space to create “honeypots” machines set up with vulnerabilities to draw hackers. Or it could be looking to set up dedicated infrastructure — software and servers — to scour traffic for suspect activity.

“This greatly increases the space they could monitor” said Madory who published a blog post on the matter Saturday.

What a Pentagon spokesman could not explain Saturday is why the Defense Department chose Global Resource Systems LLC a company with no record of government contracts to manage the address space.

“As to why the DoD would have done that I’m a little mystified same as you” said Paul Vixie an internet pioneer credited with designing its naming system and the CEO of Farsight Security.

The company did not return phone calls or emails from The Associated Press. It has no web presence though it has the domain grscorp.com. Its name doesn’t appear on the directory of its Plantation Florida domicile and a receptionist drew a blank when an AP reporter asked for a company representative at the office earlier this month. She found its name on a tenant list and suggested trying email. Records show the company has not obtained a business license in Plantation.

Incorporated in Delaware and registered by a Beverly Hills lawyer Global Resource Systems LLC now manages more internet space than China Telecom AT&T or Comcast.

The only name associated with it on the Florida business registry coincides with that of a man listed as recently as 2018 in Nevada corporate records as a managing member of a cybersecurity/internet surveillance equipment company called Packet Forensics. The company had nearly $40 million in publicly disclosed federal contracts over the past decade with the FBI and the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency among its customers.

That man Raymond Saulino is also listed as a principal in a company called Tidewater Laskin Associates which was incorporated in 2018 and obtained an FCC license in April 2020. It shares the same Virginia Beach Virginia address — a UPS store — in corporate records as Packet Forensics. The two have different mailbox numbers. Calls to the number listed on the Tidewater Laskin FCC filing are answered by an automated service that offers four different options but doesn’t connect callers with a single one recycling all calls to the initial voice recording.

Saulino did not return phone calls seeking comment and a longtime colleague at Packet Forensics Rodney Joffe said he believed Saulino was retired. Joffe a cybersecurity luminary declined further comment. Joffe is chief technical officer at Neustar Inc. which provides internet intelligence and services for major industries including telecommunications and defense.

In 2011 Packet Forensics and Saulino its spokesman were featured in a Wired story because the company was selling an appliance to government agencies and law enforcement that let them spy on people’s web browsing using forged security certificates.

The company continues to sell “lawful intercept” equipment according to its website. One of its current contracts with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is for “harnessing autonomy for countering cyber-adversary systems.” A contract description says it is investigating “technologies for conducting safe nondisruptive and effective active defense operations in cyberspace.” Contract language from 2019 says the program would “investigate the feasibility of creating safe and reliable autonomous software agencies that can effectively counter malicious botnet implants and similar large-scale malware.”

Deepening the mystery is Global Resource Systems’ name. It is identical to that of a firm that independent internet fraud researcher Ron Guilmette says was sending out email spam using the very same internet routing identifier. It shut down more than a decade ago. All that differs is the type of company. This one’s a limited liability corporation. The other was a corporation. Both used the same street address in Plantation a suburb of Fort Lauderdale.

“It’s deeply suspicious” said Guilmette who unsuccessfully sued the previous incarnation of Global Resource Systems in 2006 for unfair business practices. Guilmette considers such masquerading known as slip-streaming a ham-handed tactic in this situation. “If they wanted to be more serious about hiding this they could have not used Ray Saulino and this suspicious name.”

Guilmette and Madory were alerted to the mystery when network operators began inquiring about it on an email list in mid-March. But almost everyone involved didn’t want to talk about it. Mike Leber who owns Hurricane Electric the internet backbone company handing the address blocks’ traffic didn’t return emails or phone messages.

Despite an internet address crunch the Pentagon — which created the internet — has shown no interest in selling any of its address space and a Defense Department spokesman Russell Goemaere told the AP on Saturday that none of the newly announced space has been sold.

Not on a day he struck out three times not in a 6-2 loss in the midst of a team-wide offensive struggle not on a day he dropped an easy throw and botched a double-play chance.

But maybe a year or two from now when he tells the story to his kids and grandkids Zack Short will leave out all the ugly stuff and just say I got my first big-league hit at Comerica Park against Mike Minor a line-drive single.

""You want to enjoy it"" Short said after Friday's game. ""I'm glad my family saw it and everything. But it's tough to really enjoy it having a few tough at-bats and the guys in the dugout are grinding on every at-bat. Things just aren't going our way right now.

""It's awesome it happened but at the end of the day we didn't get the job done. It's tough to enjoy one with the other.""

In the same ninth inning that he dropped the throw he also made a sterling defensive play getting speedy Nicky Lopez with a glove flip. And on the pitch before his single in the sixth it looked like his first big-league hit might've been a home run.

He hit a hooking line drive down the line in left.

""I've hit a few of those like that in my career and they usually stay fair"" Short said. ""The wind wasn't in my favor all night for trying to do something like that. I got halfway to first and I realized it was foul.

""I just flushed it on my way back to the plate and tried to come up with a another plan on what he was going to throw me.""

Alas Short was optioned back to the alternate site in Toledo after Saturday's game to make room for Miguel Cabrera activated off the injured list.

Baddoo at two

Give manager AJ Hinch credit he's not just running the same lineup out there night after night hoping things change. He's continually looking for a spark. He put Short in the two-hole Friday against a lefty.

On Saturday he moved rookie Akil Baddoo a left-handed hitter up to the two-hole against right-hander Brady Singer.

""I've tried to keep him comfortable and keep him in down in the seventh eighth or ninth hole and I may return him to that"" Hinch said. ""But right now I'm looking for any kind of energy and any kind of production — just something different than what we've been doing over and over.""

Baddoo went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts Saturday.

The Tigers have averaged two runs over the last nine games. They also have the lowest team OPS and have scored the fewest runs of any team in the American League.

It's about development

HInch started Baddoo Friday against the lefty Minor — a move that was as much about Baddoo's development as it was about putting the best team on the field that night.

""For Akil it's about giving him a little taste for what being an everyday player is like; that is very important"" Hinch said. ""The thing about left-handed hitters especially young ones that I've been around they play against lefties their entire career coming up through the minor leagues and in amateur ball.

""And then somebody in the big leagues tells him they can't hit them before they even give them at-bats.""

Baddoo is 0-for-8 against lefties with six strikeouts but he will get more looks against them soon perhaps in Chicago against the White Sox who have two lefty starters and two lefty bullpen arms.

Three local families will be honored by the Bartlesville Community Foundation during its 13th annual Legacy Hall of Fame Gala on May 15. The is the first of three profiles of those families.

The Dunlap family has been in Bartlesville since 1937. Originally from Hardy Arkansas Ray and Lucile Dunlap and their young son Ken moved to Bartlesville when Ray had an opportunity to work for his uncle who was a home builder in town. Ray went on to found Dunlap Construction Co. in 1939. In 1945 daughter Theresa was born which completed the first generation of Dunlaps in Bartlesville.

While Ray operated the family business Lucile was active in many organizations. She also helped with Ken’s Boy Scout troop taught Sunday school at the Bartlesville Church of Christ and was the cook at the local Girl Scout’s Camp Wah-Shah-She for 40 years. She was once described as “A fine Christian lady who loved her family her community state and nation and served all of them well.” Lucile died in 1975.

After graduating from College High School in 1949 Ken attended Oklahoma A&M then transferred to Drury College in Springfield Missouri. There he met and married his Drury College sweetheart Levah Bishop of Springfield. They returned to Bartlesville where Ken joined Ray in the family business. Father and son spent nearly 30 years working together before Ray died in 1982.

Ken and Levah raised three sons Mike Tom and Jim in Bartlesville. The boys all attended Will Rogers Elementary Madison Middle School and Sooner High School. They all earned college degrees and returned home to work with their dad at Dunlap Construction. Levah also worked in the family business for many years until her death in 2010. Ken died March 7 2020 at the age of 89.

Theresa taught science Central Middle School for 31 years. She lived in the home she grew up in at 10th Street and Jennings and continued the traditions of her mother by being a volunteer for the homebound and needy throughout the community. Theresa died August 13 2020 at the age of 75.

Mike and his wife Paula have three adult children. Ryan is a Marriage and Family therapist in Jackson Mississippi where he lives with his wife Bridget and daughters Kennedy and Blakely. Travis and his wife Sophia live in Bartlesville where Travis owns a piano and percussion business. He served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives for four years. Kelsey currently works in business services in Breckenridge Colorado. Paula is retired after working for the construction company and then ConocoPhillips. Mike served four years on the Bartlesville City Council including two as vice mayor. He has served as Washington County Commissioner since 2007.

Tom and his wife Janey have two daughters Emma and Sara. Janey has spent 24 years in public education including 17 years as a pre-K teacher at Will Rogers and Wayside Elementary. Emma is married to Tim Hamilton and they have one daughter Evelyn. Sara is married to Skyler Scullawl and she works for ConocoPhillips. Tom is retired from Dunlap Construction and is enjoying time with his first grandchild Evelyn.

Jim and his wife Pam have three children: Harrison Preston and Avery.

Edison tuvo una extraña experiencia con un visitante anónimo del laboratorio que le hizo una prueba de clarividencia. Además investigó al psíquico Bert Reese un personaje muy conocido en la época y que afirmaba tener rayos X en los ojos. No encontró como creía que iba a hallarlo evidencia de que se tratara de un fraude. Además en 1920 anunció que estaba diseñando una máquina para comunicar con los difuntos. Es más hay informaciones que nos hablan de supuesto mensajes suyos que hizo llegar a numerosas personas mucho después de morir. Ante el temor de que se dañara su recuerdo la familia eliminó un capítulo de sus diarios publicados en 1948 donde Edison hablaba de sus creencias en el más allá.

Se trató de un personaje rodeado de polémica. Algunas de sus declaraciones sobre ciertos temas son muy controvertidas y casi desagradables por ejemplo cuando concedió varias entrevistas en las que arremetía contra los judíos. También se dice que se adueño de los conocimientos de científicos de algunos especialistas que no tenían ningún espíritu de notoriedad a quienes les robó sus saberes para patentar la bombilla y algunas de las decenas de inventos que se le atribuyen.

These were bottles that attracted the most consumer attention while also defining category trends.

The 2021 Wine Growth Brands Awards follow our 2021 Spirits Growth Brands Awards posted last week .

As always our lists include the most innovative new brands emerging stars comeback stories and tried-and-true staples.

Growth Brands Wines That Shine

To say that 2020 was a rough year would be a massive understatement but it was particularly rocky for people in the wine industry. Not only did they have to contend with the pandemic overall with the business shutdowns and the decimation of the on-premise sales they also endured several serious wildfires on the West Coast of the U.S. and got caught up in tariff wars.

Nonetheless the turmoil brought on by Covid-19 actually seemed to improve wine sales. The Beverage Information and Insights Group projects that wine volume increased about 1% in 2020 vs. falling nearly 1% in 2019.

Many winemakers saw an increase in off-premise sales as the shelter-in-place rules took effect.

“Like all other wine brands we clearly lost on-premise consumption” says John Wardley marketing vice president Americas for Treasury Wine Estates which won several Growth Brand Awards this year. “However this was more than made up in our gains from off-premise growth and increased consumption at home.”

Treasury Wine Estates won a Rising Star for 19 Crimes the line inspired by the convicts-turned-colonists who built Australia. The company was able to bring more consumers into the 19 Crimes franchise Wardley says.

During Covid-19 shoppers spent less time shopping in-store and gravitated towards brand names they know and trust says Gary Heck owner and president of Korbel Champagne Cellars. “So we put our best foot forward in the off-premise.”

Korbel California Champagne won a Comeback Brand Award while Korbel prosecco won a Rising Star. It helps that Korbel has always been an off-premise-focused brand Heck notes. But with the impacts of the pandemic the company capitalized on this shift in consumer purchasing behavior by doubling down on its off-premise efforts.

“We listened to our retail partners and focused on making sure our basic principles were solid: our product variety and distribution price shelf and floor placement and promotions” Heck says. “This allowed us to meet consumers where they were.”

Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits won a Fast Track award for Josh Cellars. Covid-19 initially drove a massive uptick in sales for wine and spirits as consumers pantry loaded at first and as the pandemic wore on continued to increase their at-home consumption says Tom Steffanci president Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits.

“The wine growth was dominated by a small number of brands” he says. Josh Cellars had significant benefit because of the high regard consumers have for the brand its strong consumer awareness and quality Steffanci notes. The brand is up more than 42% in dollar sales during the last 12 months “which is twice as fast as it was growing pre-pandemic.”

The fastest-growing wine was BeatBox Beverages  a bag-in-box wine punch from Future Proof up a whopping 84.3%.

“It’s great to see more and more retailers capitalize on the energy and excitement consumers have for our brand” says Co-founder Brad Schultz. “While it’s nice to be recognized as number one in back to back years we feel like we’re just getting started.”

Shiny Bubbles

Sparkling wines including prosecco have been on the upward trajectory for a number of years says Heck. “Much of that has been due to its light small bubbles affordable price points and the perception that it is now more of an ‘everyday’ consumption beverage. With the impacts of Covid-19 consumers took to shopping Korbel and other sparkling wine brands in the off-premise and celebrating small everyday moments at home.”

Another broad industry trend that has benefited Korbel is the explosive growth of rosé Heck says. “With two of the leading sparkling rosé products in the category Korbel Brut Rosé and Korbel Sweet Rosé we are well positioned to tap into this trend by providing a sparkling wine that is right for this consumer.”

What’s more the Prosecco DOC Consortium last year approved a Prosecco DOC Rosé  and pink proseccos began hitting the market in late 2020. Comeback Brand winner Cupcake Vineyards and Established Growth Brand recipient Chloe Wine in January released their prosecco rosés .

“Earlier this year we were among the first wine brands to introduce prosecco rosé following Italy’s move to add the classification” says Steffanci. He believes Josh Cellars is well poised to win the prosecco rosé segment with its strong built-in consumer base and success with other varietals including prosecco which it launched just over a year ago. Josh Prosecco is now the fastest-growing and fourth largest prosecco in the U.S. Steffanci says.

Snoop There It Is

A number of wine brands have partnered with star power in the past few years “and with the growth of celebrity endorsed/owned wines there has been a significant increase in consumer engagement” says TWE’s Wardley. 19 Crimes in April 2020 announced a partnership with rap star/entertainer Snoop Dogg on a California wine called Snoop Cali Red .

“Some brands have leveraged their celebrity connection far better than others” Wardley says. “19 Crimes’ partnership with Snoop is arguably the most overt given he is front and center on the package and central to the augmented reality experience” that the brand’s labels incorporate.

The launch of 19 Crimes Cali Red helped fuel momentum on the base brand as more consumers became aware of 19 Crimes he notes. The first California bottling from the Australian wine brand Snoop Cali Red is a blend of Lodi-sourced petite syrah (65%) zinfandel (30%) and merlot (5%).

Snoop Dogg and 19 Crimes unveiled Snoop Cali Rosé  a blend of grenache and zinfandel in March 2021. “The recent launch of Cali Rosé will also attract even more consumers to the 19 Crimes franchise” says Wardley.

Growth Brands and Great Expectations

While the pandemic put a crimp in spending for many consumers others opted to spend a little more on wine since they were stuck at home. Or if they did go out they may have selected a better wine by the glass or bottle.

“Consumers continue to trade up and have high expectations of the brands they choose” says Alex Wagner vice president of communications for the Wine & Spirits Division of Constellation Brands which won a number of Wine Growth Brands this year. “Overall people are willing to spend more on each wine they purchase and expect high quality great flavor profile and a compelling and engaging brand narrative.”

This industry trend aligns well with Constellation’s The Prisoner Wine Co. which earned a Fast Track award she says. “The portfolio sits within the luxury category; however with an approachable tasting profile and consumer proposition that’s perfect for the budding consumer coupled with a layered complexity that is sure to please the established enthusiast.”

Constellation in 2020 expanded The Prisoner label with the addition of The Prisoner Cabernet Sauvignon and The Prisoner Chardonnay  which now accompany the flagship Red Blend. “To introduce these exciting new wines and support the local hospitality industry during this challenging time we partnered with Saturday Night Live’s Chloe Fineman and executed a delivery program in New York and nationally with Drizly in the fall” Wagner says.

E. & J. Gallo which recently completed the acquisition of more than 30 wine brands from Constellation Brands also won several growth brands this year including a Rising Star for Locations. The brand launched by star winemaker Dave Phinney as a way to showcase wine regions around the world was acquired by Gallo in 2018. Priced at about $20 a bottle Locations offers high quality at a good value.

CK Mondavi & Family in summer 2019 released Flat Top Hills described as a modern line built on four generations of winemaking history. The brand which boasts wines with bold flavors distinctive fruit-forward style and sleek design won a Rising Star Award while CK Mondavi & Family wines took an Established Growth Brand.

Looking Ahead

As the Covid-19 crisis hopefully subsides this year winemakers are optimistic about the future. And what they’ve learned during the unprecedented pandemic period will serve them well in meeting new business challenges .

“As we all navigated a fluid situation” Wagner says “we pivoted with rapidly changing consumer trends and shifted our efforts to a digital/DTC-driven format to ensure consumers and our wine club members could still engage with the brand while in lockdown.”

At The Prisoner Wine Co. Tasting Lounge in Napa Valley “we pivoted our tastings as needed in order to welcome back visitors in a way that was safe and enjoyable for both staff and patrons” she notes. “The team worked tirelessly to adjust seating arrangements and safety protocols.”

While Covid-19 has left many people unemployed and uncertain about the future Korbel has benefitted from its affordable price points multiple different varietals and a variety of packaging sizes Heck says. The company released Korbel Prosecco in 187-ml. bottles this past November.

For Josh Cellars the brand’s advertising has become a key factor in driving increased buyer penetration and sales volume Steffanci says. “Paid media has become a core short- and long-term growth driver especially in the off-premise.”

Knowing consumers would spend more time online “we decided quickly to invest significantly more in 2020 to drive awareness and brand equity using digital and social advertising which make up the majority of our advertising investment” he notes. Josh Cellars also has a consistent presence on Hulu and other full episode players such as CBS and NBC YouTube programmatic online video and Facebook/Instagram.

Covid has changed the way that consumers shop for wine Steffanci says. “Unplanned shopping trips are down and people spend less time in stores than they used to. As a result it’s become more important than ever to reach consumers online while they are planning their shopping and then again when they enter the store or visit a website to purchase.”

As for the on-premise channel which has been severely impacted by Covid given the widespread closures and restrictions “restaurants and bars will come back strong” Steffanci predicts. “We’re committed to rebuilding Josh’s on-premise presence as the channel is now beginning to come back strong in most markets.”

In particular Josh is investing to drive by-the-glass menu placements he notes. “We retained our sales personnel and we are reinstating our budgets so while others are pulling back we will be there to provide support.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYmVlcnRvZGF5LmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvY3VyaW91cy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LTA0MjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New management team revealed at Curious Brewery - Beer Today,"New management team revealed at Curious Brewery

Risk Capital Partners (RCP) has marked the completion of its purchase of Curious Brewery by appointing a new management team.

Pub and brewing veteran Mark Crowther and former UK head of Budweiser Budvar Simon George join the business as chairman and managing director respectively. They will take the business forward following its acquisition by RCP the private equity firm led by Luke Johnson from English wine company Chapel Down.

Johnson said: “We are delighted to be working with Mark and Simon who together bring an enormous wealth of experience and expertise adding immense value to this business. I couldn’t think of two better people to help unleash the potential for Curious Brewery and we’re looking forward to supporting them as they get stuck in.”

Crowther was most recently chief executive at Liberation Group and has held senior positions at Carlsberg Brakes and Diageo. He is currently non-executive chairman at Portobello Brewery.

George who will be responsible for day-to-day operations led Budweiser Budvar in the UK for seven years before stepping down in January and previously held senior commercial roles at Magners Coors and Constellation Brands.

Crowther said: “This is a high-quality business with a great group of people an exceptional premium range of superb beers and ciders and an extraordinary market-leading set-up with its state-of-the-art brewery and accompanying tap room and restaurant.

“Now with the support of RCP it has one of the most experienced and supportive sector-specialist investors in the market and I am delighted to have the opportunity to work with them and to support the team as we embark on this exciting new phase.”

Cathedral to beer

George added: “I am tremendously excited to be involved in this unique opportunity. We see enormous potential to build this business and we are going to work very hard to ensure this fantastic collection of premium beers and ciders are available enjoyed and shared in more places across the UK and internationally.”

The change of ownership follows a multimillion-pound development of the new brewery in 2019. Located in Ashford Kent opposite the international train station it was described at the time as a ‘cathedral to beer’ and was constructed alongside a visitor centre and a 120-cover bar-restaurant. The deal will be followed with planned investments in a new bottling and canning line as well as increased support for the sales and marketing functions.

The brewery which has four core brews — an award-winning lager a session IPA a cider and a porter — was started in 2011 by Chapel Down. The pandemic saw the group refocus on its core wine business giving rise to the opportunity for RCP to acquire the brewery. As well as acquiring the brand and assets the deal which was completed yesterday will see all of the company’s staff move across to the new set up.

As well as listings in many hotels bars and restaurants its beers are sold in some prime venues including luxury department stores Harrods and Selfridges as well as Waitrose and Majestic and leading arts venues such as The National Portrait Gallery Royal Festival Hall and The Royal Opera House.

Johnson added: “We see terrific potential in the Curious business and we’re very excited about its future despite the challenges of the past year. Brewing will always be a cornerstone of British culture and the craft beer revolution has only strengthened that.

“Curious is a great brand made in a fabulous facility and with our support we believe the business can be developed further. The restaurant and taprooms will be opening to welcome guests as soon as we are allowed. We are particularly pleased to be taking on all Curious employees who bring with them a wealth of insight and knowledge.”",,,,,,,,,

The London company’s constellation of miniaturised satellites will use high resolution infrared cameras to collect temperature data day and night about both the natural and built environment.

Being less than 1/10th of the size and cost of other infrared imaging satellites Satellite Vu is unique in being able to measure the heat signature of any building anywhere multiple times a day. This enables Satellite Vu to derive new insights about both the building and how it is being used.

This capability is a game-changer in the global quest to achieve net zero emissions opening up for the first time the potential to monitor in near real time everything from the energy being wasted by poorly insulated buildings through to measuring economic activity by observing how many shifts a factory is operating and how much energy a power station is generating.

This year the UK holds the Presidency of COP26 the pivotal United Nations Climate Change Conference. Many nations have declared plans to tackle this global challenge including President Biden’s $2tn infrastructure plan that includes plans to upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes.

Boris Johnson the UK Prime Minister set out his 10-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution highlighting the challenge of greening homes and public buildings and developing the cutting-edge technologies needed to reach these new energy ambitions. Satellite Vu has a solution.

The temperature data Satellite Vu collects can quickly pinpoint the worst energy wasting buildings such that investment in energy efficiency measures can be deployed based on measurement data.

“This ground-breaking and timely technology will for the first time allow the government and the public to make better and informed decisions on which buildings are a priority to upgrade” said Anthony Baker CEO of Satellite Vu.

“The lessons learnt from the pandemic were: test test test; in the climate change challenge we need to: measure measure measure. Satellite Vu’s technology is the best satellite system by far to measure the temperature of buildings globally consistently and recurrently with multiple revisits per day.”

James Bruegger Managing Partner of Seraphim Capital which led the funding round said: “We believe that high resolution infrared satellite data holds enormous promise for positively impacting the world.

“A combination of poor resolution high cost and infrequency of data capture has held back the application of this high impact dataset for decades. We’ve backed Satellite Vu because it alone has the technology to address all these issues and make high resolution infrared the next major category of space data.”

The seed round that was multiple times oversubscribed was also supported by A/O PropTech – Europe’s largest Proptech venture capital firm – alongside other specialist investors including Ridgeline Ventures the Earth Science Foundation E2MC Ventures and Stellar Solutions.

Satellite Vu has been backed by the UK Space Agency through its National Space Innovation Programme (NSIP) to support the build of the infrared sensor for its first satellite and has also partnered via the SPRINT programme with the world-renowned University of Surrey to evaluate the utility of infrared observations in the maritime domain.

The newly announced funding round will enable Satellite Vu to initiate the construction of its first satellite that is due to launch in 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The auction website does not list the proper cause of damage to the vehicle but states the primary cause as burning. There is no explanation as to how exactly di the fire start and the engine exterior and the cabin of the vehicle ended up in ashes.

The only identifiable components of the vehicle are its two wheels and the engine which suggests that the GT was split into half when it was crashed. Originally a Black 2005 GT the sale date for the ruined vehicle is yet to come and the bidding will start then.

The Ford GT in question was equipped with a 5.4-litre 8-cylinder engine with manual transmission and rear-wheel drive.

Auction website Copart is known for selling various damaged and ruined vehicles that people usually buy these vehicle for cheap in order to get the original and genuine parts of the vehicle. Last month the website had put up for sale six wrecked Ford Bronco Sports models each of which was wrecked in a different way.

A Blue Bronco Sport one of the six that were put on sale mostly sustained rear-end damages while its cabin seemed mostly damage proof. A Black Bronco Sport was involved in a rollover and eventually caught fire with very few of its parts seeming to be recoverable. One of these six Broncos was driven for only 258 miles and has sustained damages at front-end including its three-cylinder engine. The remaining three Broncos also suffered minor damages either at the front or rear end.

The site also includes roughly 8000 square feet of ground-floor retail.



The California Community Housing Agency purchased the property at 275 W. Lexington Drive from Cypress Equity Investments.



Neither company responded to requests for comment.



The property was 92% leased at the time of the off-market sale according to CoStar Group Inc. It was built in 2019 by local developer Century West Partners.



The California Community Housing Agency also recently purchased the Brio apartments in Glendale for $110 million.



The Brio complex located at 546 W. Colorado St. has 205 units and was built in 2013. It was sold by Sequoia Equities Inc.



CCHA is a state agency that was established in 2019. Catalyst Housing Group acts as an asset manager for the agency.



The Next on Lex and Brio acquisitions represent Catalyst’s expansion into Southern California.



Catalyst is “focused on affordably and sustainably housing our essential middle-income workforce” Jordan Moss founder of Catalyst Housing Group said in a statement.



He added that the acquisitions would provide residents with rent-restricted housing and protect people from being displaced.



“We are excited to take this step and increase housing opportunities for middle-income households. As a mayor and advocate for affordable housing I am looking forward to seeing this approach take shape in Glendale” City Councilmember Vrej Agajanian who was mayor of Glendale at the time of the sale said in a statement.



Current Glendale Mayor Paula Devine added that rent has outpaced income which has been felt by low-income and middle-income households.



“This model emphasizes good practical ideas to help protect a part of our existing population who cannot afford rent but do not qualify for assistance” she said in a statement.



Next on Lex and the Brio aren’t the only recent sales in L.A. County where the owner is seeking to provide middle-income housing.



Waterford Property Co. and the California Statewide Communities Development Authority recently purchased a 216-unit luxury apartment community in Long Beach for $120 million. The property named the Oceanaire is located at 150 W. Ocean Blvd.



Waterford and the CSCDA plan to convert the complex into middle-income housing with Waterford serving as the property administrator.



It’s part of a workforce housing finance program that CSCDA started last year. The program uses tax-exempt bonds to finance multifamily acquisitions.



Glendale has seen interest from other property owners as well.



Brentwood-based JRK Property Holdings Inc. acquired Harrison Glendale a 164-unit luxury apartment complex for $90.7 million earlier this year.



The complex is located at 318 W. Wilson Ave. one block from the Glendale Galleria and The Americana at Brand shopping centers.



The Harrison was 96% leased at closing. In addition to multifamily units it has a central courtyard with a pool park and barbecue area; a two-story fitness center yoga studio; club room; and dog run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3NlcnZlcmZhcm0tc3RyaWtlcy03MW0tZWwtc2VndW5kby1ocS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Serverfarm Strikes $71 Million Deal for El Segundo Headquarters,"Serverfarm and Culver City-based NantWorks have purchased a data center in El Segundo for $71 million from T5 Data Centers.



The 117500-square-foot building at 444 N. Nash St. will act as Serverfarm’s headquarters. Serverfarm and NantWorks have partnered on other projects.



Serverfarm which also has an office in the United Kingdom manages the physical infrastructure for data centers. In total the company owns or manages more than 100 locations in more than 40 countries.



The Nash Street property was 80% leased at the time of the sale according to CoStar Group Inc. It has hyperscale transportation health care and government tenants.



Serverfarm modernizes the facilities it acquires with a data center management as a service technology. The company uses InCommand technology to increase the capability of its centers.



The El Segundo property will be updated to increase capacity.



“Throughout the pandemic we’ve been laser focused on delivering much-needed capacity to our clients and partners in the most efficient way possible” Avner Papouchado Serverfarm chief executive said in a statement.



“The latest phase of our data center acquisition strategy is helping to answer demand for efficiently managed co-location space in a Los Angeles site that’s a launching pad to APAC and the rest of the world. We’re proud to offer our world-class InCommand DMaaS solution in a community that’s home for myself and many of our team members” he added.



Demand for data centers in Los Angeles County increased 25% from 2019 to 2020 according to a report released in March by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.



The pandemic-fueled rise in remote working is expected to continue driving that demand and developers are taking note.



There are currently about 2.3 million square feet of data center space in L.A. and another 160000 square feet are under construction according to JLL.



Internationally data center activity passed $30 billion last year according to JLL. That was led by San Francisco-based Digital Realty Trust Inc.’s $8.4 billion purchase of European data center operator Interxion.",,,,,,,,,

The allure of bulk buys is what drives many people to shop at Costco. But if you find that you always have a hard time scoring a parking spot you're definitely not alone. Thing is you don't always have to wait on a super long checkout line at the big-box store. If you're looking to make your trip quick and easy this is the best day to shop at Costco.

Many people save their food shopping excursions for the weekend and with good reason. After all in-office 9-5 jobs don't leave a lot of time to peruse the aisles at Costco during the workweek salivating over those buttery croissants and $4.99 whole rotisserie chickens. If it's possible though you should try to avoid Costco on the weekends when it's at its busiest (via RD).

But Saturdays and Sundays aren't the only days when Costco gets crazy crowded. In fact you might find that Fridays and Mondays are equally as busy as their weekend counterparts. The reasoning: people stock up on Fridays for the weekend and conversely stock up for the week come Monday (via My Recipes).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxpc3QuY29tLzM5MTgxMy90aGUtc3VycHJpc2luZy1yZWFzb24ta3Jpcy1rYXJkYXNoaWFuLWlzLW9ic2Vzc2VkLXdpdGgtY29zdGNvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Surprising Reason Kris Kardashian Is Obsessed With Costco,"The Surprising Reason Kris Kardashian Is Obsessed With Costco

Courtesy of the tribe

In a rural pocket of east San Diego County sits the home of the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation. The Sycuan Reservation was set aside a hundred and fifty years ago by President Ulysses S. Grant.

One square mile became home to a rural band of Mission Indians on land that lacked resources and wasn’t suitable for farming. It was a rough new home in a very poor area. Nonetheless Sycuan’s people have succeeded despite all odds being stacked against them.

What has differentiated Sycuan from other reservations in San Diego County? Despite the inability to profit from agriculture and cattle they have invested in economic development projects that have led to successful ventures such as their casino a high-rise hotel a golf course downtown San Diego hotels a bay boat anchorage and other businesses with over 2000 employees.

A decade or so ago the Sycuan tribal government recognized opportunity and allied itself with a private cable company to bring fiber optic technology to the reservation providing its residents with fast and reliable internet. An expensive investment at the time this infrastructure has improved over the years and is set up for new innovations such as 5G to be quickly deployed to the reservation.

As the current pandemic unraveled their wireless infrastructure has proved critical to the reservation’s residents. Their community health and education initiatives including community college courses have continued remotely.

Unfortunately the success of Sycuan is rare. Some of the 18 Indian reservations across San Diego County lack infrastructure access to services and economic development. These conditions can have dire consequences. Indian reservations across the country have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Navajo Nation where about 300000 Navajos live in the Four Corners area of Arizona Colorado Utah and New Mexico for example experienced some of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the nation. Their home is hundreds of thousands of square miles of beautiful desolate land with large areas within the reservation having little infrastructure.

It’s no secret that Native American populations across the United States face countless barriers to accessing healthcare or other services that most Americans easily access in cities and suburbs.

Infrastructure access to essential services and economic opportunities help save lives improve quality of life and contribute to long term economic prosperity. Sycuan is partially able to thrive because of it’s past and current investments in economic development projects and in constantly improving their infrastructure. In this digital age working to expand and improve telecommunications infrastructure as Sycuan did is important in the advancement of services and economic opportunities for everyone.

Today a significant number of American children are at a disadvantage due to lack of access to internet service. During the pandemic we have seen this reality as students did their homework for school on sidewalks outside fast-food restaurants or with the family mobile phone.

Today we rely on different forms of digital communications not only for online schooling but to make appointments health care and to order billions of dollars of goods and services. The digital divide in all communities is critical and an issue that needs to be addressed quickly.

Not only will investing in this infrastructure help provide internet access for more people it will also create jobs. Telecommunication companies such as Crown Castle and carriers like Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile are working overtime to deploy 5G infrastructure in San Diego County and across the country. In California alone 2.3 million 5G-related jobs and an additional $25.3 billion in gross domestic product can be developed by 2025 according to an Accenture study commissioned by San Diego-based Qualcomm.

Research indicates a national potential to create or change up to 16 million jobs while generating up to $1.5 trillion in additional national GDP between now and 2025. The economic impact is extremely valuable especially to areas that lack resources.

This investment in critical infrastructure will stimulate local economies and provide reliable internet connection with the necessary bandwidth.

As a country we need to focus on investing in wireless infrastructure. Improvements to existing infrastructure as well as deploying wireless infrastructure to rural and Native American communities is critical in addressing the digital divide. Real-time bandwidth in every home will improve people’s access to essential services and support students as many return to hybrid virtual and in-person classes this month.

Sycuan’s 640 rocky acres of dirt and granite are a testament to the significance of wireless infrastructure in helping to move communities forward. Economic investments and modern Internet connections have changed Sycuan’s rural home from a patch of unforgivable terrain to one of prosperity and promise.

Downtown Miami stop Jupiter service maybe VA station,"By: Dale King

If you’re wondering what former Boca Raton Mayor and Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams has been doing for the past couple of years he’s been working on the railroad.

The longtime Boca and Palm Beach County politician who initiated the post of Palm Beach mayor – and held that job for a year – took over the reins of the authority that operates Tri Rail commuter service in December 2018 following the retirement of its former chief.

Abrams made a “virtual” visit to the Greater Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce last week to enlighten Government Affairs Committee members about what is happening along the 73-mile rail line. The tracks offer a road of steel to Tri Rail Amtrak and CSX freight service in Palm Beach Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Hence the “tri” of “Tri Rail.”

Lots of things are in the works said the boss of the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority. Using an existing connection to the Florida East Coast rail line that parallels the CSX Tri-Rail is going to “jump” some of its trains to the FEC to add a stop in downtown Miami.

He said the connection at Hialeah will start being used after Brightline installs its Positive Control System an emergency braking method required by the federal government. The system will kick in if trains operate too fast or pass through a red signal.

At the other end he said Tri Rail will be extending service to Jupiter and is pondering a link going west one that could result in the creation of a depot at the Veterans Administration Hospital off 45th Street in West Palm Beach.

With more riders coming from the Jupiter area Abrams said a station may even be feasible at Palm Beach International Airport. Right now Tri Rail is focusing on accessibility to Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports.

“There are two rail corridors in South Florida the one Tri Rail uses and the FEC” he told about two dozen Chamber members and guests tuned to the SFRTA chief’s discussion via computer last Thursday.

“A lot of folks don’t realize that the two lines are connected at two locations one in Hialeah and another in West Palm Beach. A third is planned in Pompano Beach and the current Brightline terminal in Miami will also become a stop for Tri Rail.”

He said COVID-19 has meant trouble to both rail lines. Brightline which started running fast-rail service between West Palm Fort Lauderdale and Miami a year or two ago had to shut it all down due to the coronavirus.

But that didn’t stop the operators of Brightline service. Construction continues on an extension of tracks to Orlando and Disney World. Abrams said the Orlando run may begin in 2022.

Calling Brightline mainly a tourist-based train as opposed to Tri Rail more of a commuter-based convenience he said the operators of the rapid trains are also building a similar rail line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

He said the operators “have deep pockets” even without the participation of Sir Richard Branson who dropped out of the Florida rail equation taking his “Virgin” name with him.

Officials in Boca Raton last year gave the green signal to Brightline to build a train station that will provide a stop in Boca. Abrams said Tri Rail will also have a platform at the new Boca Brightline station to be located next to the city’s downtown library on NW Second Avenue.

Part of what Abrams called his “grand view” of Tri Rail’s future will include using of the Hialeah split to send about half of the system’s daily trains onto the FEC line with a terminus in downtown Miami more convenient to shoppers and visitors.

During his address Abrams a familiar face in Boca talked of the importance of public transportation particularly in light of the current pandemic which has ignited an exodus of newcomers to Florida.

“Rail is the only mode that takes cars off the road” he said noting Tri Rail’s commentary: “400 cars equal eight buses equal one train.”

Multi-rider transit will also be needed if the nation is to make positive changes in the climate. “We are ground zero for climate change. To reduce the carbon footprint we need public transportation.”

He said northbound Tri Rail service currently terminates in Mangonia Park in Riviera Beach. Plans are in the works to extend commuter trains to Jupiter which will open a spigot of passengers from the county’s northern tier.

That influx he said might require a station at PBIA. But the airport in West Palm Beach he said “has an abundance of parking and the fee is reasonable.”

He said Tri Rail already runs full-size shuttle buses to the airports from station stops near the aviation locations. Efforts are in the works to make the transfers more convenient.

Also the Boca Raton depot on Yamato Road has shuttle service to Florida Atlantic University. Tri Rail trains run every 20 minutes during rush hour he said a service to all riders.

As he spoke of the Boca rail station Abrams noted that Tri Rail issued an RFP (request for proposals) looking for companies interested in setting up shop on the seven or eight acres around the station owned by the transportation authority. The final decision will be made by Tri Rail’s board.

Another RFP will be advertised shortly for SFRTA-owned land near the Boynton Beach station.

Because the CSX tracks in Mangonia Park jut out to the west Tri Rail could add a link to run service to the VA Hospital. Trains running farther to the west is another idea under consideration.

He said Brightline is also considering running a train line from Orlando to Tampa.

To make Tri Rail trains safe for riders sanitation is emphasized and hand sanitizers are much more available. “Riders should be comfortable already.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNC8yNS9tdW5yb2UtZmFsbHMtcmFpbHJvYWQtdHJhY2tzLW5vcnRoLXJpdmVyLXJvYWQtcmVwYWlycy1zdW1tZXIvNzMyNzAyMjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Munroe Falls railroad tracks North River Road repairs this summer,"Two roads repairs are planned in Munroe Falls starting in June.

One of the biggest changes was ushered in by the introduction of the EMD SD70MAC diesel locomotive. The transformation of railroad rosters from D.C. traction locomotives to A.C. traction began and the results have revolutionized railroads big and small.

EMD’s SD70MAC was the first production alternating-current traction locomotive to be delivered to a customer when Burlington Northern accepted the first of hundreds of SD70MACs in December 1993. A.C. traction has a number of benefits such as providing significantly more tractive effort; eliminating minimum continuous speed limitations found on all D.C. traction locomotives; and using traction motors that are more durable in the punishing railroad environment.

EMD began testing six-axle A.C. traction two years earlier building four SD60MACs for field testing. These would be the only 60-series six-axle A.C. traction locomotives EMD would produce. Refinements between the SD60MAC and SD70MAC included an enhanced 710 engine that increased the horsepower output from 3800-horsepower on the SD60MAC to 4000-horsepower on the production SD70MAC.

The SD70MAC enabled Burlington Northern to reduce the number of locomotives assigned to each coal train and/or lengthen the trains due to the locomotive’s additional pulling ability.

EMD would end up producing more than 1000 SD70MACs before regular production ended in late 2004 although a handful were built for Alaska Railroad in 2007. First purchaser Burlington Northern and later BNSF would end up owning the majority of the SD70MACs produced for North American service at 786. Conrail CSX Transportation Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana and Alaska Railroad round out the list of original owners in North America.

As of early 2021 SD70MACs can still be found on class I railroad rosters short lines and regionals and even in industrial service.

The lone commercial bank listed on the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) held its first annual shareholder’s meeting this week.

A copy of the minutes obtained by Khmer Times revealed that ACLEDA Bank Plc (Acleda) had 14 proposals up for voting.

Shareholders voted 99.97 percent in favour to approve a 30 percent of dividends distribution – equal to $42.493 million. They also agreed to raise the salary of Chhay Soeun chairman of the board of directors after the firm successfully became what is considered the first blue-chip company on the CSX.

The 416 shareholders accounting for nearly 430 million shares also overwhelmingly approved to reappoint Independent Director Peter Kooi and Directors Albertus Bruggink and Stephane Mangiavacca for the next three years.

A total of 69.2 percent of shareholders agreed not to reappoint Ian Lydall the former independent director for Acleda.

The shareholders meeting was originally slated to be held on April 1 at Acleda’s head office but was delayed because of the pandemic according to sources familiar with the matter. Instead communications were made via email and voting was conducted digitally via quick response code.

Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone has also announced that it will hold its annual shareholder’s meeting via video conference on May 17. Shareholders will have six resolutions to vote on including the renewal of the share buyback policy."

New life could soon be breathed into the site of a Lanarkshire factory that manufactured diesel train and car engines.

The former Cummins site in Shotts is being marketed by Shepherd Commercial and the chartered surveyors have been encouraged by the level of enquiries.

The leases for two large industrial units measuring 161925 sq ft and 69481 sq ft and a hard standing 5.77 acre yard at M8 Business Park in Calderhead Road are being advertised as Warehouse and Distribution opportunities.

The M8 Business Park site is ideally suited for travel between Scotland’s two biggest cities sitting almost midway between them. It is also close to and has good road links with Lanarkshire’s biggest towns and the Euro Freight Terminal at Eurocentral.

Steve Barnett managing partner at Shepherd Chartered Surveyors said: “We are greatly encouraged by the level of enquiries received to date in advance of the launch of the formal marketing campaign of this iconic building.

“Industrial stock has continued to perform well partly due to occupiers seeking additional space as a result of the recent expansion of e-commerce but also through the change in vacant rates liabilities a number of years ago which led to a significant amount of dated industrial stock being demolished and developed for alternative uses thereby reducing supply at a time when demand has been rising.

“Add in the additional stock-piling requirements as a result of Brexit coupled with limited speculative development over recent years demand has outstripped supply resulting in a rise in rents and capital values as the level of ‘take up’ increases.”

Cummins’ diesel engine factory was opened in Shotts back in 1956 but closed down in 1998 with the work being moved to Darlington in the north east and elsewhere in England.

It was the company’s first manufacturing facility outside of the United States and employed around 2000 workers at its peak.

Cummins moved to a site in Shotts known as the Wrens Nest which had been home to a textile company.

Many of Cummins’ initial Lanarkshire employees were ex-miners.

The operation moved to a custom-built factory in the early 1980s.

Cummins ceased operations in Shotts 23 years ago when its American owners confirmed the loss of 700 highly skilled engineering jobs. The plant was still successfully manufacturing engines for trucks buses and trains at the time.

Around 85 per cent of the workforce at the time lived within a five-mile radius of Shotts.

They were manufacturing up to 60 engines each day many going overseas to rail customers in Japan and the Netherlands.

At the time a former MP who had been instrumental in helping to bring the Cummins company to Shotts called the decision to close it “a tragedy” for the town and its people.

The closure came less than two years after thousands of people celebrated the company’s 75th anniversary at an anniversary party in Shotts.

They were also celebrating a marked upturn in production at the plant following a period of recession and a reduction in the number of workers there. But the future looked bright.

Cummins’ was formed in Columbus Indiana by chauffeur Clessie Cummins.

In 1913 he started up in the garage of his employers.

When Pat Cummins hammered Jasprit Bumrah for 4 successive sixes in IPL 2020 - Watch,"Throwback! When Cummins hammered Bumrah for 4 sixes | Photo Credit: PTI

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) speedster Pat Cummins was bought for a whopping 15.5 crore rupees in the 2020 IPL auction and naturally he has been one of the most talked-about cricketers because of his imposing price tag. While his bowling antics need no introduction at all fans did not know a lot about Pat Cummins’ abilities with the bat. Cast your mind back to IPL 2020 in Abu Dhabi. Against Mumbai Indians (MI) Cummins did not have the best of outings with the ball. But wait there was a twist in the tale!

Pat Cummins displayed tremendous abilities with the bat as he tonked MI bowler Jasprit Bumrah for 4 sixes. His batting stance is a visual treat and it seemed like he could muscle the ball around the park for sixes with absolute ease. Jasprit Bumrah who was coming on the back off an injury layoff and for this reason he did not have a good New Zealand tour was off-colour in that game. Cummins smashed him for 4 continuous sixes as the yorkers from Bumrah failed and they were full tosses! It seemed like Cummins saw the cricket ball like a giant football that day!

Pat Cummins was inconsolably distraught during his bowling stint as he was smashed for 49 runs in just 3 overs. The Mumbai batsmen took him to the cleaners and batted with great confidence against him. But not many people were aware that Pat Cummins is an exceptional all-rounder. Though KKR were on the losing side as they fell short by 49 runs this knock sent a signal that Cummins could bat well. He had scored 33 runs off just 12 deliveries in that quick-fire cameo.

In IPL 2021 too we witnessed an absolute crackerjack of an innings from Pat Cummins in the 13th match of the IPL. Chasing a mammoth total of 221 against an in-form Chennai Super Kings (CSK) KKR were in absolute shambles after they had lost 5 wickets in the powerplay. But when Andre Russell departed in the 11th over Cummins came in and literally blew away CSK with his incredible knock. He middled every single delivery and took the CSK bowlers to the cleaners with his clean strikes. He smashed 6 sixes and 4 fours in his knock of 66*. Though KKR eventually lost the game by 18 runs Cummins’ knock was a clear indication that KKR’s batting line-up is very deep.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Sachin Tendulkar play trademark shots against Pat Cummins Kagiso Rabada Jofra Archer in video shared by ICC,"Fantasy battles are ones that everyone wants to have a slice of.

The move comes following the state Department of Health's announcement Friday night that use of the vaccine can resume.

New Jersey's recommendation followed a guidance by the federal Centers for Disease Control to lift the 11-day pause on the use of the vaccine after a rare blood-clotting disorder was associated with the shot.

NJ officials said Friday an information sheet mentioning the rare clotting problem and the symptoms to look out for will be provided to individuals who receive the vaccine.

Here's what different chain pharmacies in the state are doing:

CVS COVID vaccine

Stores that were holding J&J vaccines on refrigerator shelves since the April 13 recommendation by the FDA and the CDC to pause the use of the vaccine expect to post appointments on CVS.com this week Joe Goode a spokesperson for CVS said in an email.

""All warnings and precautions will be appropriately communicated throughout the vaccination process"" Goode said.

Goode did not state which CVS locations would be offering the J&J shot.

Vaccine required:Which New Jersey colleges and universities will require COVID vaccines for students?

Vaccine demand:Demand for COVID vaccine drops in New Jersey. Is a return to normalcy by summer at risk?

NJ residents seeking a J&J vaccine should book an appointment on CVS.com. The CVS site does not allow you to search for appointments by the type of vaccine you're looking for but will tell you whether the appointment you are scheduling is for the one-shot J&J vaccine or two-shot Moderna an Pfizer vaccines before you book.

Rite Aid COVID vaccine

Rite Aid will ""immediately"" resume administering the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine in locations that currently have supply a spokesperson said on Sunday.

""As we learn more from the CDC about future allocations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine we will add the vaccine back into the online scheduling tool"" spokesperson Brad Ducey said.

Appointments for the vaccine can be made online at Rite Aid's website https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/rite-aid.

Walgreens COVID vaccine

Walgreens will make the vaccine available this week spokesperson Rebecca Payjak said.

People will not be able to search specifically for J&J appointments though.

Daniel Kaluuya is heading to the Oscars. At this year’s 93rd Academy Awards the British actor is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his riveting portrayal of Fred Hampton in the historical drama Judas and the Black Messiah. Daniel made his debut at the award show three years ago with his rumored girlfriend by his side. Perhaps on Sunday the Black Panther star will be accompanied by her once again. But who is Daniel’s alleged leading lady Amandla Crichlow? Here's what we know:

Amandla is an actress and producer.

Like Daniel Amandla is also in the film industry. According to her IMDB her first project was the TV mini-series Prime Suspect 7: The Final Actor in 2006. Amandla’s résumé also includes working behind the scenes as a production coordinator. She’s been part of pre-production for shows like Peaky Blinders.

In April 2019 Amandla joined Daniel’s production company 59% as a producer per her LinkedIn. Shortly after Deadline reported that she was appointed an executive at the company. During this time she’s worked on the action-drama Curfew.

She and Daniel are supposedly a pretty private couple.

In January 2018 Daniel was nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globes for his work in the horror thriller Get Out. This black-tie event was the first time Daniel was spotted with Amandla. That year she attended several other red-carpet affairs with Daniel like the SAG Awards the premiere of Black Panther and the 90th Academy Awards.

Since then the couple has been photographed only one other time at an afterparty for Daniel's film Queen & Slim in November 2019. What’s more neither Daniel nor Amandla are active on social media.

Her family is well known.

If Amandla’s last name rings a bell it might be because her father was British Civil Rights activist Frank Crichlow. In 1968 Amandla’s father opened to the doors to his Trinidadian restaurant Mangrove in Notting Hill London. Locals quickly made the all-night eatery their go-to stop. But in the 1970s tensions rose when London police repeatedly raided Mangrove under the pretense of drug searches according to Bustle. Frank protested against the racist encounters and was part of the Mangrove Nine.

Additionally Amandla has an older sister named Lenora Crichlow. She’s also an actress best known for her roles in Sugar Rush and Black Mirror.

Sheila Witte remembers the three little vials a nurse brought to her rural school in the Midwest.

The vials contained the polio vaccine a groundbreaking development in immunology that would eventually eradicate the potentially fatal and disabling childhood disease that was still prevalent when Witte was a young girl in the late 1950s.

Her mother wouldn’t let her get the shot. Her family was firmly committed to self-reliance. Medical intervention was not an option and if illness came whatever the outcome was it was meant to be.

“Dad used to say you’re not sick (but) go to the doctor and you will be” said Witte now a high school teacher in the Las Vegas area. “That is in me.”

The coronavirus pandemic made her reconsider. Nobody wants COVID-19 and Witte accepted she could protect herself if she turned to medicine and got a vaccine.

It’s not easy for everyone to decide to get vaccinated even after witnessing the worldwide devastation the coronavirus has brought the past year. In Nevada alone a state of only 3 million people COVID-19 has sickened more than 300000 and killed roughly 5400 according to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services.

Mistrust suspicion fear and complacency if not lack of access create a sizable population of people who resist all vaccines. For COVID-19 a March survey by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that 17% to 21% of Nevada residents were “probably not” or “definitely not” going to get vaccinated.

About half of those who said they were hesitant were strongly hesitant or in the “definitely not” group.

State health department data show that roughly 44% of all people age 16 and older have had at least one shot so far as of Thursday. And Clark County is incentivizing vaccination by agreeing to reopen at 100% capacity with no physical distancing mandates — only mask mandates — once 60% of residents 16 and older have had at least one shot.

Some residents have overcome their fears. Here are three stories:

The power of science and love

Kiera Bright does everything for her little girl Dream.

Dream was born in August 2019 the result of the beautiful art and science of in-vitro fertilization after Bright suffered a miscarriage and two ectopic pregnancies.

When the coronavirus pandemic kicked off in earnest in March 2020 Bright an independent makeup artist went into hard lockdown in her North Las Vegas home to protect her high-risk parents and newborn Dream. Bright still hasn’t been inside a grocery store.

Ultimately her decision to get vaccinated came down to Dream and the pregnancies that came before.

Bright 35 mistook her second ectopic pregnancy — where a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus and is aways unviable — for a typical miscarriage that she would tough out but the resulting internal bleeding and seizures nearly killed her. After misdiagnosing herself she didn’t want to chance it again.

She thinks she’d probably beat COVID-19 but she’s humbly aware that she’s been wrong in the past.

Plus science won.

“We wouldn’t have Dream if it wasn’t for science so I don’t feel like it was fair for me to trust science in one aspect of my life but not trust science in the next aspect” Bright said.

She was nervous and initially in the “wait and see” camp. She also has family members who are anti-vaccination and she was pressured by misinformation online.

“You see things on social media — people were saying that people getting the vaccine were like lab rats all types of crazy stuff” Bright said. “So of course if you see that stuff enough times it starts to slip into your head a little bit.”

Accepting the advice of their fertility doctor and after lots of family discussion she and her husband Brandon both decided to get vaccinated. For Dream.

Bright got her first shot at a CVS pharmacy in late March otherwise not yet eligible but allowed to take advantage of a canceled appointment to avoid vaccine waste. Dream’s eyes opened wide at all the new faces she saw after spending much of her life in quarantine. Brandon got his earlier because he works in front-line food distribution.

Bright is proud of their decision. She wears her mask in public with peace of mind and with an N95 mask and goggles gets inches from people’s faces to do their makeup as the wedding industry returns to near-normal.

She thinks more people will get on board as the vaccine is now available to all ages and occupations and they see people they know get it without negative effects. She’s happy to share her own experience with her 25000 Instagram followers and have them spread the word. Everyone’s an influencer.

‘We did not doctor’

Witte’s COVID-19 shot was her first vaccination. Ever in her 67 years.

Witte grew up on a farm in Missouri hill country under generations of people who worked hard lived long off the land never got sick and never saw a doctor or took medicine for anything. Not for a burst appendix like her dad suffered while fighting in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Not for the fractured hand she sustained in a car wreck.

“We did not doctor” Witte said. “We just didn’t.”

Her father Harry had a cut-and-dried philosophy.

“He thought that you should get (diseases). That way you got stronger” she said. “If you lived.”

She did live through childhood whooping cough mumps chicken pox and three bouts of measles within a year and a half and a vicious case of flu as a college student in 1972. The flu persuaded her to go to the hospital where she believes her mother was prepared for her to die. Witte had double pneumonia and took an experimental drug that her doctor didn’t explain much.

She isn’t sure if all this made her stronger.

Though she avoided polio she knew the intensity of constant other illnesses and how delicate they left her as a girl. She remembered her healthy teenage neighbor dying of the same flu in the same hospital when she was there. She didn’t want to go through that again and she especially didn’t want it for her students at Southeast Career Technical Academy.

So on Feb. 8 after months of deliberation Witte rolled up her sleeve at the COVID-19 vaccination clinic at UNLV. She told her vaccinator that this would be the first inoculation she’d received in her life. They told her she was brave.

Witte researched the vaccine from the time she heard it was being developed. She waffled. The drug she took for the flu battered her and on the rare occasion she does take medication now she is extremely sensitive to its effects.

But this is a global emergency she reasoned and she wanted to be part of the solution.

“The problem isn’t the vaccine” she said. “The problem is the virus. It’s a strong little virus that mutates and we have to stop that. I guess if you die from the vaccine chances are you might have died from COVID.”

Witte’s aversion to medicine is still strong. She has a high pain tolerance — she refuses anesthesia at the dentist and had her two children drug-free although she acquiesced to hospital births and got them the full complement of childhood vaccinations.

Then she thought about the neighbor boy dying suddenly and the uncle Walter she never met because he died after fixing a fence in a snowstorm with her father before fully recovering from measles and pneumonia. Walter her dad said just wasn’t as strong as him.

“I did weigh the factors and I think what made me decide was if I have to pick between hopefully living through COVID or the shot and the drug and the effects of it I’m going to try this new thing called the vaccine” she said.

Endorsements from family friends and Fauci

Kevin Youngblood also wanted to wait and see. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine to market in less than a year gave him pause.

“To put it out that fast kind of made me wonder” said Youngblood a Las Vegas photographer. “I understand why they did it and how they did it that fast but the fact that they put it out that fast was kind of concerning.”

He said he wasn’t afraid but hesitant. He needed to hear from people close to him what their side effects were. He thought it over for a few weeks.

Friends and his brother who had already been vaccinated gave him the evidence he needed saying they had no issues other than a sore arm.

“That made me feel better” Youngblood said.

On Wednesday he went for it. From opening his computer to find an appointment at Cashman Center not far from where he lives to returning home with a bandage on his arm was about an hour and a half.

He had wanted the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because he wanted a one-and-done regimen. He just doesn’t like shots. But the Pfizer dose he did get wasn’t nearly as bad as he thought it would be. He expected side effects to be mild too and for the greater good.

Youngblood who photographs outdoor sports follows an ultrarunner to races around the country and he also wanted to resume easier travel.

People in his circle and national leaders alike have been good ambassadors.

“We can be pretty confident and listen to those in authority the Faucis out there that have been doing this for years that they know what they’re talking about and they have the confidence in it” Youngblood said. “We should be pretty confident about it and get away from all these conspiracy theories and things that have no evidence.”"

Governor Mike Parson visited the John Deere Reman facility in Springfield on Friday to talk about economic development and job growth.

The visit comes on the heels of an announcement last month that the company would move drivetrain and hydraulic manufacturing operations from Canada to Springfield.

The move scheduled to take place over the course of 2021 is expected to add about 130 new positions and a more than $10 million investment in adding a 130000-square-foot warehouse and modifying two other existing facilities.

The new employees will join approximately 400 others already working in Springfield.

The transition is expected to be complete by October.

“John Deere Reman is committed to helping our customers become more profitable and sustainable across the full lifecycle of our products” said Jena Holtberg-Benge manager John Deere Reman Business. “By consolidating operations and creating a center of excellence in Springfield the company is well positioned for future growth.”

John Deere Reman in Springfield produces engines fuel and electronics remanufactured components for Agriculture and Construction customers around the world.

The company builds more than 2500 unique parts to support the service of equipment well beyond the warranty period.

""Remanufacturing offers customers a unique opportunity to meet the service needs of their equipment at a lower price point with quality that’s equivalent to new parts"" the company said in a press release. ""Remanufacturing of components also has significant environmental benefits through reuse and recycling of material.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGdvbGZwb3N0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlZC9vbGQtZGF3Zy1uZXctdHJpY2tzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Dawg New Tricks,"Humans always seem drawn to the shiniest new things whether it’s smartphones sports cars or robot vacuum cleaners. Our attraction to the freshest faces in golf is no different.

Recent late-qualifying Masters rookies Will Zalatoris and Robert MacIntyre – both 24 years old and loaded with promise – made a big splash with their performances at Augusta National. Zalatoris seemingly arose from nowhere and with no status to finish runner-up by a skinny stroke. MacIntyre who guaranteed his Augusta return with a T12 has been a steadily rising Scottish lefty who first turned global heads with a T6 in his major debut in the 2019 Open Championship.

They were two of the last three players to earn berths in the Masters at the final top-50 deadline. The third player however didn’t draw as much attention despite his dramatic bum rush of the gates at Magnolia Lane from relative oblivion a few weeks earlier and his own daily presence on the leaderboards and T12 finish.

Brian Harman isn’t shiny and new. He’s 34 years old and has been on the golf radar for nearly two decades since crafting a decorated junior résumé that included winning the U.S. Junior Amateur 11 years before Zalatoris did the same. He was the youngest player ever picked for the Walker Cup team as a junior golfer and played in twice as many (2005 and ’09) as Zalatoris and MacIntyre.

Harman’s career path follows the typical ebbs and flows that the game often generates. Amateur and collegiate glory followed by mini-tour efforts and an eventual PGA Tour breakthrough with a pair of victories (2014 John Deere and 2017 Wells Fargo) on his CV.

He rose as high as No. 20 in the world in January-February 2018 after a hot start in Hawaii. But Harman had fallen as low 138th at the end of last summer and was ranked No. 95 in the world heading into the Players Championship in March.

That’s where the fun started again. Harman contended at Sawgrass from beginning to end never out of the top five at the end of any round. His third-place finish jumped him to 58th and got him into the WGC-Match Play. In Austin Texas he advanced from his group and rallied to beat fellow former Georgia Bulldog Bubba Watson in the first knockout round to reach the quarterfinals. That was just enough to move him to world No. 49 and eke out his third career invite to the Masters.

Once again Harman shot a pair of 69s and was in second place after each of the first two Masters rounds.

“You know three weeks ago I didn’t expect to be playing in the Masters” he said. “So after a couple good days to be in contention is just icing on the cake for me. It’s great.”

“Start of the year I knew I was playing well and wasn’t having any good finishes. I’m glad I’m up there in some bigger tournaments because I feel like this is how my game has been trending.” – Brian Harman

Lost in his strong form on those recent big stages is that Harman has been playing some consistently good golf since the tour returned from its COVID shutdown last spring. He’s made 10 consecutive cuts and 21 of 22 going back to last July – the only missed weekend ironically in the RSM Classic where he resides in Sea Island Georgia. Eight of those finishes have been top-20s including the last four straight.

“I’ve been playing some really good golf and a lot of that has to do with what I’ve been working on” he said. “I’ve been working hard on my short game and my putter is starting to come around again. Start of the year I knew I was playing well and wasn’t having any good finishes. I’m glad I’m up there in some bigger tournaments because I feel like this is how my game has been trending.

“I haven’t been putting that great this year and I’ve been making a ton of cuts; just kind of finishing middle of the pack and not really making any noise. I have to putt well. I’ve been doing a lot better and my short game has gotten a lot better.”

The 5-foot-7 Harman has never been one of the game’s long hitters. He averages 288 yards on all of his drives this season outside the top 100 on tour. That has never deterred him.

“I think there’s still plenty of room in the game for a guy like me” he said. “I don’t make any bones about not being able to carry it 300 but I don’t think you have to.”

Harman has always had to compensate in other areas of his game – “my game is fairways and green and making putts” he said – which makes his admitted “neglect” of his short game curious. His short-game was always exceptional and helped dominate the junior ranks and win his very first tournament as a collegian at Georgia.

“What happens is you tend to work on your weaknesses … at some point at the expense of your strengths” said Chris Haack Harman’s coach at Georgia.

Harman credits his current resurgence to finally refocusing on that aspect of the game he relies on the most.

“It’s something I always neglected – I just kind of took it for granted” he said recently of his short game. “It’s something that I can’t afford to be average. It’s got to be really good for me to contend. … I’ve been working really hard on it … and I’ve started to see it sort of pay off a little bit but I’ll keep after it and see how good I can get it.”

What that requires is not hitting another ebb tide in his performance. At 34 he doesn’t have the same luxury of time that guys such as Zalatoris and MacIntyre are blessed with as they rise through the ranks.

“For me I’ve got to keep going. I’ve got to keep playing good” Harman said in Florida when his hot streak was just starting. “Seems like every time I start playing really well out here it’s like I take a mental break: ‘Oh I’m playing good.’ I’m going to try to push through that and keep working hard and just elevate my game to where I think it should be.”

“He’s always had the mindset he plays to win. You could tell by the way he was talking and wincing about describing some putts at Augusta. I think he realizes how close he was and he said he learned a lot this year about Augusta that he didn’t know.” – Chris Haack

Harman isn’t satisfied with merely being prominent on leaderboards but not winning. He’ll be hungry when he shows up at the PGA Championship at Kiawah where he’ll go to get a preview taste next weekend. The Ocean Course will be one of the longest in major championship history but contending with the winds tidal marshes and challenges of a southeast Atlantic seaside course is something Harman has been doing all his life growing up in nearby Savannah Georgia and now living in Sea Island.

“It’s got a lot of characteristics of what he plays on at home” said Haack of Kiawah. “I would imagine he’ll feel comfortable in those elements.”

Contending at the Players and Masters was nice but not nearly enough for a player who grew up so accustomed to winning all the time. Harman left Augusta not thrilled to have booked an automatic return next April but shaking his head at mistakes around the greens that cost him a chance to win a green jacket on the weekend.

“The last two days have been really disappointing” he said of his weekend pair of 74s. “Yeah I mean I’m happy with the week I suppose. It’s always hard when you’re up there and you don’t do as well as you want to on the weekend. Man I don’t know. I don’t know. I tried my best I know that.”

Said Haack: “He’s always had the mindset he plays to win. You could tell by the way he was talking and wincing about describing some putts at Augusta. I think he realizes how close he was and he said he learned a lot this year about Augusta that he didn’t know.”

Intensity has always been a trait of Harman – a player who admittedly savors the art of a cathartic club throw. His small stature belies the aggression with which he often plays.

“A guy I looked up to and playing a bunch with was Anthony Kim” said Harman recalling the record 11-birdie round Kim once had at Augusta. “I used to always love the way that he played the game. He’s bold and took on … took chances. I’m not as good as he was but I’d like to think that I try to harness some of that energy sometimes.”

Harman credits his caddie Scott Tway with helping settle him down when things get too taut.

“I tend to run kind of hot and kind of cold and he’s sort of leveled me out” Harman said. “So that’s really good and he’s been here a long time and seen it a bunch of different ways and I just think we do good work together. He’s seen me at my worst and I’ve seen him at his worst. At this point we’re like an old married couple.”

When he really needs to unwind Harman turns to bow hunting for everything from wild turkey and hogs to elk and deer. That’s what he did the day after the Masters bagging a turkey before showing up at Harbour Town refreshed enough to post another solid T13.

“I like to get out and spend time in the woods especially this time of year” he said. “Turkey hunting is one of my favorite things to do … and I love to fish and hunt.

“Got into bow hunting pretty heavy the last several years. And I feel like making a bow shot on an elk or a deer or something I feel like I use my golf to train my nerves for that.

“I had a buddy that made a bad shot on an elk a year or so ago and he’s like ‘Man how do you …’ I said ‘Well I’ve been training my nerves since I was 11.’ I don’t know if I get quite as shaky shooting an elk as I do trying to make a 10-footer.”

Harman might not be golf’s shiniest new star but he’s aiming to stay in the hunt and make everyone notice.

“You can just tell his whole demeanor and attitude about his golf game has gotten better” said Haack who visited with Harman this week at Sea Island before the SEC Championships. “He was beating himself up a little bit and not playing with the confidence he did when he was younger. I think he’s realizing he can compete with any of those guys.”

I agree with the majority of Mike Purkey’s points on the state of golf commentary but let's put the blame squarely where it belongs: in the big white house at the end of Magnolia Lane (“TV networks’ lovefest with PGA Tour cheats viewers” April 22). This false purification of the game has been a staple every April since I was knee high to a sand wedge and since Mr. Obsequious (Jim Nantz) first occupied the booth at 18.

If the Masters can demand the “good news only” approach with no bikini-waxed greens there why not the Players? And if the Players then why not the Heritage? And of course if the Heritage then why not even the John Deere Classic?

Golf is a game but every Saturday and Sunday from 2 to 6 p.m. it is treated like a religion where it seems that pointing out a problem with the greens is blasphemy or suggesting that something be done to address a popular player's tendency for slow play demands excommunication.

It’s hard to return the ills to Pandora's box; but just as athletes study game film maybe the announcing crews could show up on Monday and spend the next 24 hours watching Gary McCord Pat Summerall the old David Feherty Peter Alliss and Ben Wright. It might occasion a return to the Golden Age of Commentating. Who knows? Maybe even Ian Baker-Finch will cast a critical eye at some point in the second week of April.

Modern technology caddie insight improve TV commentary

The criticism of golf telecasts certainly has merit but on the other hand I’ve marveled at the new visuals graphics drone cameras and ball-flight electronics (“TV networks’ lovefest with PGA Tour cheats viewers” April 22). Add insightful on-course analysis from former caddies Jim “Bones” Mackay and now John Wood on NBC and this viewer has been entertained. The drone-camera angles alone have added depth to the venues removing the flatness we’ve seen forever.

What hard-hitting journalism is expected for golf? Rules controversies? Covered. Players’ personal foibles? Covered. If there’s more digging to be done it normally would come from print or web journalists rather than host/anchors such as Jim Nantz Nick Faldo Dan Hicks or Paul Azinger who do address headline events to my satisfaction.

CBS has plenty of stale no doubt but the network still has got the action and plot lines well-covered plus great visual aids in the most difficult sport to televise with perhaps a dozen consequential balls in play at once. This recent drama-less Masters afforded more-than-normal time for banal chat so the knives are out. Even Verne Lundquist was reduced to little more than a dramatic reading of player names. “Jordan Spieth Xander Schauffele … to 15.”

CBS’ syrup and sound-alike international voices with little original or unique insight are easy enough to ignore. The missus uses it instead of sleep inducers. Peter Kostis Gary McCord David Feherty along with Nantz’s buddy Tony Romo in the booth would be a delight but my wishes aside I’m still watching and enjoying.

Plato would see through today’s PGA Tour

Absolute gem of a column authored by the unfiltered Mike Purkey (“TV networks’ lovefest with PGA Tour cheats viewers” April 22) one of Morning Read's finest contributors.

Who would have thought that CBS and NBC golf telecasts would evolve into chummy “Cheers”-like episodes where everyone knows your first name? Kudos to Purkey for stating the obvious: that the two major networks and Golf Channel are an extension of the public-relations department of the PGA Tour.

A few years ago I vividly remember listening to Peter Jacobsen make the call of a pro in contention hitting two balls into the water fronting the green on a par 3. Both shots were chunky but to Jacobsen who's never witnessed a bad shot from a touring pro two wind gusts suddenly cropped up in the backswing. Does Jacobsen believe TV golf audiences are naive or stupid?

Where is Johnny Miller when you need him? I miss the inimitable Miller because he was the only golf commentator to apply correctly the word “choke” in the appropriate situation especially when it's visually happening live on the TV screen.

As Purkey points out golf journalism continues to shrink and quality has eroded. Do you think it was a coincidence that when Hank Haney was fired by SiriusXM Radio in June 2019 after PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan called the SiriusXM radio president to complain about content on Haney’s golf talk radio show?

Clearly the PGA Tour is a monopoly that banishes or punishes its critics. Now the Tour is offering its premier players $40 million in bonus money to engage with fans and promote its brand which is really a last-ditch effort at surviving after the imminent retirement of Tiger Woods.

Perhaps the words of Greek philosopher Plato apply to today's PGA Tour hierarchy when he said “Things are not always what they seem; the first appearance deceives many; the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden.”

‘From bad to worse’ at CBS

I totally concur with Mike Purkey’s thoughts about TV commentators (“TV networks’ lovefest with PGA Tour cheats viewers” April 22).

Moreover it is overly tiring when they repeatedly bring up their fellow commentators’ past accomplishments. Muting becomes a popular option.

Perhaps someone will develop a tournament real-time audio app with minimal but informative commentary in un-accented English.

It's just going from bad to worse with the CBS old-chums club.

Give me David Feherty Roger Maltbie Dottie Pepper and Jim “Bones” Mackay and avoid the incessant CBS babblers.

Give Barkley a shot at golf analysis

My suggestion is to include Charles Barkley (“TV networks’ lovefest with PGA Tour cheats viewers” April 22). He’s clearly an avid golfer and fan.

As a golfer Barkley has a swing that tells you all you have to know about his expertise. However if you ever watched him doing basketball analysis he is very candid about the players. Therefore I think he’d be a good fit for golf broadcasts.

I don’t always agree with the many things he has said but his objectivity is refreshing.

What’s normal according to Norm isn’t the norm

I am very disappointed with the “foreign accent” attitude of reader Norm Amyot of Melbourne Fla. (“From the Morning Read inbox” April 23).

Does that mean that any announcer from the Southern states Texas New Jersey New England or Canada with their regional accents also would be foreign to Amyot?

Maybe the networks can broadcast only in Melbourne Fla.-speak. I would suggest that Amyot go and visit some of the wonderful places in the world where the accents he abhors come from.

His eyes and mind might be opened.

Canadian has just ‘aboot’ had it y’all

I can't agree more with reader Charlie Jurgonis in his thoughts on LPGA purses (“From the Morning Read inbox” April 23). The game played by the women is so much more in tune with the average male golfer.

For all the millions spent on high-tech drivers the facts continue to show that the average performance level has not improved. We are deeper into the rough and woods but our scores are not better. The LPGA game is more like how we all play and because of that far more interesting to watch. I can relate far more to that 7-iron that flared a little right and didn't get the 160 I dreamed it would. I cannot relate to 300-yard drives and 160-yard pitching wedges. That Brooke Henderson who won this week's LPGA tournament but gets $225000 compared with the winners of the men's team event getting $1 million each is obscene.

On broadcasters’ accents I offer this: Would you rather that your commentators offer accurate analysis regardless of their accent or is a gushing pro American accent more to your taste? I prefer articulate discussion and worry not about what accent the speaker has. I like Dottie Pepper big-time and she has a minimal accent. I also like Curtis Strange and he has a notable accent. Equally I like David Feherty and the Immelman brothers Mark and Trevor because they can give precise and experience-based reporting.

As a Canadian who has spent his long life listening and reading the eh and aboot references to Americans’ perceived view of our accents I want you all to know that y’all charming as it is quite simply is not a word.

Let the outrage commence.

Use some of that extra loot to boost fields at smaller events

The PGA Tour’s proposal for the Player Impact Program is a terrible idea (“Is PGA Tour’s popularity bonus a good idea?” April 23). It rewards popularity not good golf and not even participation.

One of the current challenges is getting top-ranked players to compete in smaller tournaments. So if the PGA Tour has $40 million just lying around looking for a purpose I suggest using it to pay top-10 players to play these smaller events.

It would help smaller tournaments improve their fields and do more to grow the game.

Golf stars' agents likely are scheming for pieces of new pie

The piece about the PGA Tour’s $40 million set-for-life (and beyond) pool failed to mention the bigger money machine: endorsements (“Is PGA Tour popularity bonus a good idea?” April 23).

I easily can imagine agents for the likely top-mentioned stars plotting their endorsement strategies now.

How far is too far in effort to attract attention?

Due respect to John Hawkins of ""Hawk & Purk"" for taking the glass-half-full position on the PGA Tour's popularity contest – a noble effort – but I can't help thinking he drew the short straw (“Is PGA Tour popularity bonus a good idea?” April 23).

Speaking of the popularity contest: Will the players' publicists get a percentage of the winnings like caddies?

Will there be a leaderboard?

What if a player tries to grab some bonus television and social-media exposure by wearing a Turd Ferguson hat?

Stop the nonsense

People still are having trouble figuring out the FedEx Cup points and now popularity metrics? (“Is PGA Tour popularity bonus a good idea?” April 23).

Enough of this nonsense.

Over the weekend the Atlanta-based carrier upgauged a slew of domestic routes with wide-body jets marking the ultimate upgrade for premium-cabin passengers. These planes usually fly Delta's longest international jaunts so they're outfitted with lie-flat seats in biz and some even sport a premium economy cabin too.

With most countries closed for the foreseeable future the carrier would seemingly prefer flying its widebodies on select domestic flights instead of parking them in the desert.

Of course Delta's schedule could still change especially as more international destinations begin reopening to Americans but in the meantime here's the latest update on where you'll find Delta wide-body jets on domestic flights per Cirium schedules.

Stay up-to-date on airline and aviation news by signing up for our brand-new aviation newsletter.

The flagship will hop the coasts

Delta's flagship jet the Airbus A350 provides perhaps the best inflight experience of all the U.S. carriers.

For June and July you'll find it flying daily between Atlanta (ATL) and Los Angeles (LAX). Note that this is your only opportunity to fly Delta's posh jet domestically — Cirium schedules show that it's slated to be deployed almost exclusively on international jaunts this summer.

Delta's 306-seat A350 is outfitted with 32 Delta One Suites 48 Premium Select recliners and 226 coach seats. Some also sport a Comfort+ cabin. The biz suites feature sliding doors for added privacy making it one of the top hard products offered by the Big 3.

Coupled with Delta's new inflight service I'm adding this route to my summer bucket list.

Hawaii gets larger jets and a surprise

Hawaii has reopened to tourists once again. The island state requires a pre-travel COVID-19 test though there are reports that a vaccination certificate will soon replace the testing requirement.

Demand for travel to Hawaii is seemingly at pandemic-era highs. Flights are going out full airlines are adding new routes and some carriers like Delta are even boosting their existing frequencies.

The most notable upgrade will be found on Delta's Seattle (SEA) to Honolulu (HNL) route. Between June 5 and July 6 the carrier will fly its latest jet the Airbus A330-900neo on one daily frequency marking the first time the plane has even flown to Hawaii per Cirium schedules.

If you're looking for the most luxurious commercial option to the Aloha state this is likely it — be sure to book Flight 444 or 1628 on the outbound and Flight 705 or 2239 on the return.

Note however that schedules are still subject to change. Last week Delta filed the A330neo on the New York-JFK to Seattle (SEA) route between June 5 through Sept. 6. This week the carrier trimmed that window to start on July 8 and placed the jet on the SEA to Honolulu flight instead. Fingers crossed the updated schedule sticks.

Delta's also upgauging three other Hawaii routes with larger wide-body jets on the following routes:

Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) — Honolulu (HNL)

Salt Lake City (SLC) — Honolulu (HNL)

Salt Lake City (SLC) — Maui (OGG)

Specifically the carrier is deploying the Airbus A330-200 and A330-300 instead of the Boeing 767 on many frequencies in June and July on the aforementioned routes. The Airbus planes aren't just larger — they also sport a much improved reverse herringbone biz product compared to the forward-facing Thompson Vantage biz on the 767s.

If faced with the choice I'd recommend choosing an A330 over Delta's 767-300.

Leisure rules the recovery

Whether it's national parks or theme parks Denver Las Vegas and Orlando are three cities with plenty of activities nearby. As leisure travel recovers fastest airlines have been quick to add flights and boost existing routes to these destinations.

The latest move comes from Delta.

The carrier is upgrading two routes to Denver (DEN) one from Atlanta (ATL) and another from New York-JFK. The former will see a mix of the Boeing 767-300 and 767-400 on two daily frequencies in June and July. Between June 5 and July 6 the carrier will upgrade the latter with one daily Boeing 767-400 flight.

Las Vegas (LAS) has been a popular airport for wide-body jets operating domestic flights. Just this week American Airlines added a second daily Boeing 777 frequency between Miami (MIA) and LAS.

For its part Delta will fly at least three daily Boeing 767 flights between Atlanta (ATL) and LAS in June and at least two daily flights in July.

For those planning a trip to visit Mickey Mouse Delta's Orlando (MCO) service is getting a boost as follows:

Atlanta (ATL) — Orlando (MCO): at least one daily flight will be operated by a Boeing 767 in June and July.

Salt Lake City (SLC) — Orlando (MCO): one daily Airbus A330-200 flight from June 5 to July 6 switching to a Boeing 767-300 on July 7.

Delta's Boeing 767 fleet is split between the -300 and -400 variant. The former sports Delta's most lackluster and outdated biz.

You'll want to snag a seat on the -400 if you can. The overwhelming majority of the 767-400s have been recently retrofitted with a modified version of Delta One Suites with added privacy and personal space minus the sliding door.

The remainder is mostly hub-to-hub

Before the pandemic Delta primarily deployed wide-body jets on domestic hub-to-hub flights during downtime either as repositioning segments or for maintenance.

It's no surprise then that most of the remaining routes getting upgraded include service between hubs. You'll find the full list of changes from the latest schedule update below per Cirium timetables.

Once again be sure to note that everything is subject to change due to the pandemic — always check the aircraft type when you're making or modifying a reservation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9pbmNpZGVudC1kZWx0YS03Mzctd2l0aC1pbnN0cnVtZW50YXRpb24taXNzdWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INCIDENT: Delta 737 With Instrumentation Issues,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | April 25 2021

A Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-900 had to return to Kansas shortly after departure because the Captain’s instrumentation wasn’t working properly.

The incident happened on the 20th of April. The aircraft was performing flight DL-9950 from Kansas City (KMCI) to Atlanta (KATL). This was a positioning flight for the Delta 737 so the only occupants were the two pilots. The aircraft departed from runway 01L taking off at 13:29 local time. However the crew soon requested to stop the climb at 10000 feet.

The Delta 737 crew initially advised air traffic control that they had an airspeed indicator problem. But they soon added that “the Captain’s instruments are all bad”. The crew switched controls with the First Officer flying since his instruments appeared to work reliably. However there was still some switching left to do…

The ATC controller soon advised the Delta 737 crew that the flight’s altitude did not appear on his display. The crew then responded that they’re switching the data source for the transponder to the second pitot system. ATC subsequently reported that the aircraft’s altitude now read correctly. Perhaps it’s worth noting that the Delta 737 in the incident appeared to level off at 9725 feet not 10000. However this may be a separate issue.

A Clue For The Delta 737’s Troubles

During their exchanges with ATC the Delta 737 crew mentioned that this was the first flight that this aircraft made after being in storage for several months. Data from planespotters.net seems to confirm this. The aircraft is a Boeing 737-932ER registration N830DN aged only 6.5 years old. Delta was its first and only user since November 2014. And the aircraft entered storage over a year ago as the crew said – specifically on the 28th of March. The airline is rapidly ramping up operations as we saw.

The Boeing 737 briefly entered a hold before the Delta crew decided to return back to Kansas. The crew made an uneventful landing back on runway 01L. The aircraft subsequently stayed on the ground for 18 hours. It repositioned to Atlanta the next morning as flight DL9936 without further incident.

This event is indicative of possible issues that can arise when aircraft come out of storage after many months. But it also shows how aware crews like the one in this Delta 737 are to these possibilities. Aircraft require a lot of attention when returning to service after storage both from ground crew and pilots. Since the pitot-static system essentially works by measuring pressure obstructions of any kind can have very adverse effects to it.

Since the incident and after the Delta 737 positioned to Atlanta it has now performed eight incident-free revenue flights. As of this writing it is flying its ninth.

View the current offers here.

American and Delta are flying wide-body jets to the Caribbean this summer giving you a lie-flat seat on short flights. You'll find American 777 and 787 aircraft and Delta 767 aircraft on select routes. These include destinations like Port-au-Prince (PAP) Mexico City (MEX) and San Juan (SJU) where mainland U.S. can travel for tourism during the coronavirus pandemic.

This can be a great way to get your lie-flat fix while international travel to Europe and other destinations remains limited. There's wide-open business class award space on many of these routes too so you can book without breaking the bank.

Let's take a closer look at the award space and how to book them with points and miles.

On the American side you'll find open award space on a handful of routes that are currently operated by wide-body aircraft. These can be booked with American Airlines AAdvantage miles which may be beneficial due to discounted Web Special awards. You can book awards with standard MileSAAver award space using partner miles like British Airways Avios and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles.

Routes: Here are the routes with scheduled wide-body service:

Miami (MIA) — Port-au-Prince Haiti (PAP)

Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner

Miami (MIA) — San Juan Puerto Rico (SJU)

Boeing 777-200

Dallas-Ft. Worth (DFW) — San Juan Puerto Rico (SJU)

Boeing 777-200

These flights don't have lie-flat seats on all flight frequencies but most have at least one lie-flat equipped flight per day. Make sure to check the operating aircraft before you book. Even then your aircraft could change shortly before departure in the event of an equipment swap.

Delta is running its A330-200 and retrofitted 767-400 aircraft between its Atlanta (ATL) super-hub and San Juan (SJU) this summer. It's also flying lie-flat-equipped aircraft from New York-JFK to Mexico City (MEX) on limited dates. Delta's award pricing makes it harder to give a price estimate but I'm seeing first-class seats for as low as 22500 SkyMiles one-way to San Juan. This can be a great way to experience a Delta One seat without spending a ton of miles this summer.

Routes: These routes have some frequencies with lie-flat seats:

Atlanta (ATL) — San Juan (SJU)

Airbus A330-200 and Boeing 767-400

New York-JFK — Mexico City (MEX)

Boeing 757-200

Like American awards make sure to double-check that your flight is indeed operated by a lie-flat-equipped plane.

Normality. Or at least a place more like it than the company just finished traversing.

""Although there's still precautions that we have to take I think we all can see the light at the end of the tunnel of this pandemic"" said Mills OKC Ballet's artistic director.

""The Civic Center has done an incredible job of making sure that they are putting together a safe environment. So we're taking our lead from them in regards to what capacity they want the house to be at. That will of course be at the determination of the CDC and the recommendation of the government at that time. ... But we are looking at producing a full season.""

OKC Ballet performed earlier this month Mills' version of ""The Little Mermaid"" the final show of its 2020-21 season which was drastically reimagined due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company split into two pods kept completely separate throughout rehearsals and performances put on shorter programs with no intermissions and performed in masks even as audiences were also required to don face coverings.

""The protocols that we put in place to keep everyone safe I think were successful. They did what they were intended to do. ... But we were only able to do what we do because our state and our city kept our venue open"" Mills said.

""Honestly it's been a year where we have all had to band together and work really hard to just maintain our artists through a period where our earned revenue was going to be dramatically reduced. We've received incredible support from our community to be able to continue to produce ... which has kept our artists and moving and dancing.""

Free show

OKC Ballet's 2021-22 series will start much the same way as last season with ""Ballet Under the Stars"" a free community performance slated for Sept. 10 at Scissortail Park.

The company introduced ""Ballet Under the Stars"" last fall during the pandemic as a way to perform for the community in a safe outdoor venue and more than 3000 people attended the inaugural event.

""It was an idea that I'd had for a long time and to see it come into fruition at a time where the community really desperately needed to get out of their homes it was wonderful"" Mills said. ""It was wonderful to look back at how successful that was and to see how many people that we touched in our community. We're excited to bring it back in our upcoming season ... and you can look for that as an annual event.""

The second annual ""Ballet Under the Stars"" will feature excerpts from classical and modern ballet performed by professional dancers and pre-professional students. New this year will be pre-performance dance class for children and anyone new to ballet.

Returning favorites

For its 50th anniversary season OKC Ballet will revisit three shows that have recently been beloved by its audiences.

The dancers will return to the Civic Center for Septime Webre’s ""ALICE (in wonderland)"" Oct. 22-24 with live music from the Oklahoma City Philharmonic. OKC Ballet performed the state premiere of ""ALICE"" to open its 2018-19 season and audiences were thrilled by the colorful fast-paced take on Lewis Carroll’s often trippy classic.

""We're bringing it back because of popular demand ... with the same kind of reduced-size of orchestra that we used the last time. Matthew Pierce's score is so brilliant and last time he came and he conducted and played first violin. It's a small Broadway-style orchestra which will also be a great way to keep them socially distanced in the pit"" Mills said.

""It's a great ballet to add to the beginning of what could still potentially be an uncertain year. But we are going for it.""

OKC Ballet will revisit its cherished holiday tradition ""The Nutcracker"" presented by Devon Energy for eight performances Dec. 11-19. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic will return to perform Pyotr Tchaikovsky's iconic score and new this year Canterbury Voices will be provide vocal accompaniment.

“I have wanted to incorporate our friends at Canterbury Voices in this production for years and there is no better time than our 50th anniversary season” Mills said.

To close its golden anniversary season OKC Ballet will reawaken ""The Sleeping Beauty"" May 6-8 2022 again joining forces with the OKC Philharmonic to enliven another famed Tchaikovsky score.

The company last performed the fairytale classic in 2017 on its 45th anniversary season. One of the most beloved ballets in classical repertoire — with one of the most challenging roles for a principal ballerina — Mills promised the 2022 production will be ""bigger and grander than before.""

""It will actually be our first performances ever around the Mother's Day weekend"" Mills said.

Mixed bills

The 2021-22 season also will include a pair of mixed bills including the promised return of ""Made in the U.S.A."" Feb. 18-20. The showcase of shorter ballets — including Jessica Lang’s ""To Familiar Spaces in Dream"" the legendary Jerome Robbins’ ""2 & 3 Part Inventions"" and a world premiere by Nicolo Fonte — was originally planned as part of the 2020-21 season but had to be postponed due to the pandemic.

Putting the spotlight on dance by American choreographers the bill will feature ""Variations for Six"" created by the late Bryan Pitts who was the artistic director of OKC Ballet's precursor Ballet Oklahoma for more than 20 years. Pitts died in 2019.

“'Variations for Six' is a favorite work of mine and it was also the first ballet I danced with this company when I joined as a dancer over 25 years ago"" Mills said.

The 117500-square-foot building at 444 N. Nash St. will act as Serverfarm’s headquarters. Serverfarm and NantWorks have partnered on other projects.



Serverfarm which also has an office in the United Kingdom manages the physical infrastructure for data centers. In total the company owns or manages more than 100 locations in more than 40 countries.



The Nash Street property was 80% leased at the time of the sale according to CoStar Group Inc. It has hyperscale transportation health care and government tenants.



Serverfarm modernizes the facilities it acquires with a data center management as a service technology. The company uses InCommand technology to increase the capability of its centers.



The El Segundo property will be updated to increase capacity.



“Throughout the pandemic we’ve been laser focused on delivering much-needed capacity to our clients and partners in the most efficient way possible” Avner Papouchado Serverfarm chief executive said in a statement.



“The latest phase of our data center acquisition strategy is helping to answer demand for efficiently managed co-location space in a Los Angeles site that’s a launching pad to APAC and the rest of the world. We’re proud to offer our world-class InCommand DMaaS solution in a community that’s home for myself and many of our team members” he added.



Demand for data centers in Los Angeles County increased 25% from 2019 to 2020 according to a report released in March by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.



The pandemic-fueled rise in remote working is expected to continue driving that demand and developers are taking note.



There are currently about 2.3 million square feet of data center space in L.A. and another 160000 square feet are under construction according to JLL.



Internationally data center activity passed $30 billion last year according to JLL. That was led by San Francisco-based Digital Realty Trust Inc.’s $8.4 billion purchase of European data center operator Interxion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uL3ByaWNlLWRpZmZlcmVuY2UtYmV0d2Vlbi1jb21wbGV0ZWQtdW5kZXItY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLWZsYXRzLW5hcnJvd3MtdG8tMy01LXBjLXJlcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjI0MTIwNC5jbXPSAbUBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3NlcnZpY2VzL3Byb3BlcnR5LS8tY3N0cnVjdGlvbi9wcmljZS1kaWZmZXJlbmNlLWJldHdlZW4tY29tcGxldGVkLXVuZGVyLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1mbGF0cy1uYXJyb3dzLXRvLTMtNS1wYy1yZXBvcnQvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgyMjQxMjA0LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Price difference between completed under-construction flats narrows to 3-5 pc: Report,"

The price difference between completed apartments and under-construction flats has narrowed down to 3-5 per cent as against 9-12 per cent in the calendar year 2017 as prospective homebuyers' preference is shifting towards ready-to-move-in units due to risk factor according to Anarock. According to a report by Anarock  one of the leading property consultant in India the average price of ready-to-move-in units is higher by 3-5 per cent across seven major cities in comparison with the under-construction residential properties.In the national capital region (NCR) the average price of completed units is Rs 4650 per sq ft while under-construction flats cost Rs 4500 per sq ft.The average price of ready flats in Kolkata is Rs 4465 per sq ft up 4 per cent from Rs 4300 per sq ft for under-construction units.In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region ( MMR ) the average prices of completed and under-construction flats are Rs 10700 and Rs 10350 per sq ft respectively.The average rate of ready apartments in Pune is Rs 5650 per sq ft up 5 per cent from Rs 5360 per sq ft for units under construction.In Hyderabad also the price difference is 5 per cent. The average rates of completed and under-construction apartments are Rs 4290 and Rs 4075 per sq ft respectively.The average rate of ready-to-move-in flats in Chennai is Rs 5000 while under-construction units cost Rs 4775 per sq ft.In Bengaluru the average prices of finished and under-construction inventories are Rs 5130 and Rs 4910 per sq ft.Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said ""Previously buyers of under-construction homes had one major advantage. Their patience and willingness to court construction risk were rewarded by notably lower prices.""However he pointed out that prospective homebuyers have become risk averse due to construction delays and stalled projects and now demand has tilted heavily towards ready properties.Moreover Puri said completed homes do not attract GST has been an added attraction.""...Even the price gap between ready-to-move and under-construction homes has eroded substantially from 9-12 per cent in 2017 to just 3-5 per cent by January-March quarter 2021"" he said.Anarock said the narrow price gap works well for end-users as well as investors.End-users can see what they buy and save rent by moving in immediately while investors focused on steady rentals can start earning right away.In the past four years developers have been reluctant to increase the prices of ready homes as they need to clear their inventory.As per the data the MMR has seen the highest reduction in the gap over the last four years. In 2017 the gap between completed and under construction homes in MMR was 12 per cent but the same has reduced to just 3 per cent now.In Bengaluru the price gap was 12 per cent in 2017 but now it has shrunk to 4 per cent.Similarly in Pune the price gap in 2017 stood at 12 per cent while in the first quarter of 2021 it has reduced to 5 per cent.In NCR the price gap in 2017 was 9 per cent and now it is just 3 per cent.Anarock data showed that the price gap in Hyderabad has come down from 10 per cent in 2017 to 5 per cent in January-March 2020.In Chennai the price gap in 2017 was 9 per cent and now it has come down to 5 per cent. The rate difference between the two categories in Kolkata reduced from 10 per cent in 2017 to 4 per cent in Q1 2021.Mumbai-based Anarock clocked an 18 per cent growth in its revenue at Rs 302 crore in the last financial year despite the COVID-19 pandemic Puri told in an interview on April 11.The consultant sold 14700 units worth Rs 16240 crore on behalf of developers in the financial year 2021 he had said.Anarock which was founded in April 2017 has offices in major Indian cities and two offices in the UAE to tap non-resident Indians looking to buy real estate in India.Apart from housing brokerage Anarock is into capital market advisory leasing of retail space sale of office properties consulting business and digital real estate solutions.",,,,,,,,,

Here's how.,"South Side Chicago’s 14-screen Chatham theater complex may reopen as early as July under a new name: The Chatham Cinemas.

“Sometimes there’s a Hollywood ending” the property’s owner Jon Goldstein said Friday.

This is heartening news of what we’ll call a maybe-probably. Earlier this month the Dallas-based Studio Movie Grill hammered by the pandemic like everyone in the moviegoing business cut ties with the Chatham 14 closed since March 2020.

But now Goldstein is rolling ahead with plans to rebrand and reopen the venue located at 210 W. 87th St. just off the Dan Ryan Expressway.

He intends he said Friday to refresh the interior and exterior to the tune of an estimated $1 million — and more firmly establish the theaters as year two of the pandemic allows as a neighborhood destination and community player financed partly by public and private investment.

Along with the Chatham operation Goldstein owns and operates nine Emagine-branded theaters in Minneapolis three in the Detroit area and two in Pennsylvania.

His plans for the reborn Chatham Cinemas said 21st Ward Ald. Howard Brookins Jr. Friday can be “a win-win for the community. Jon’s trying to create a neighborhood theater as opposed to just a theater in a neighborhood.” Brookins discussed the theater’s future Saturday during a virtual town hall meeting.

If plans come to fruition the venue’s official name will be “The Chatham Cinemas Powered by Emagine” with ticketing services provided by Emagine Entertainment. Goldstein maintains a licensing and partnership agreement with Emagine.

Detroit-based Emagine runs 25 movie venues in four states including a 10-screen Frankfort Illinois location as well as a Lake Geneva Wisconsi location. In 2016 the Frankfort theater was repurposed out of a Dominick’s grocery store.

Goldstein has owned the Chatham property since 2019. It’s rare to have a landlord who’s also invested in the movie exhibition game.

“I’ve been trying to get a theater in Chicago for 20 years” he said.

Private investors Goldstein said had to “put up close to a million” to service the Chatham property’s loan and keep the building “out of the hands of the bank.” Goldstein’s near-term plans he said include seeking property tax relief (“the property value has diminished greatly”) and like so many other owners of entertainment venues shuttered by the COVID-19 crisis making his case for long-delayed federal Shuttered Venue Operator Grant funds also known as the “Save Our Stages” initiative.

“We’re applying on Monday” Goldstein said “so hopefully we’ll get an answer.”

With its emphasis on upscale dining options the Studio Movie Grill concept said Ald. Brookins never was a great fit for the neighborhood. “Some of the choices on the menu were really more about the suburbs” he said. (SMG’s sole remaining Illinois location is in Wheaton.)

He added: “You just can’t make a little kid like gourmet nachos.”

In mid-May Goldstein said he and Ald. Brookins will reconvene and discuss issues of financing; community involvement and cleanup; the transfer of the liquor license; and if the finances and community partnerships are favorable a target opening date this summer.

Earlier this year news of a Discover Financial Services call center taking over the former Target location at 86th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue brought good news (starting wages: $17.25 an hour) to Chatham development. A reopened multiplex would be good news as well.

“We want to run a movie theater but we look at this as potentially doing some true community work” Goldstein said.

His design plans include a theater lobby makeover and walls and hallways lined with movie posters inspired by Black film history.

In other words he said “we’re really going to try not to look like an AMC.”

The store carries everything from apple cutters to zippers featuring the motto - ""If we don't have it you don't need it."" The Johnsons are excited to keep the Londeen's Hardware and Furniture store going into this new chapter.

""Eighty years ago when they first started there was no Dollar General and Walmart so Londeen's kind of carried everything"" Rick Johnson said. ""As time has gone on in the last 20 years people don't think about going to a hardware store to buy a set of dishes or a glass bird or greeting cards that is more like another store like Walmart.""

Kim (Alstrom) Johnson grew up 8 miles west of Chapman off of KS Hwy 40 and graduated from Abilene High School. The couple decided to move to Chapman from Nebraska in 2019 to be closer to family.

""One day we came to visit Kim's parents and I needed a can of spray paint and my father-in-law (Tony Jones) took me into Londeen's and I was like oh my gosh this place is awesome"" said Johnson. ""When I saw the building across the street for sale I ask my wife if she would like to move to Chapman. I told her I would like to be halfway between our kids and she said sure. That is how we ended up with the Boyd's Clothing store.""

After the Johnson's moved to town they converted the Boyd's Clothing store 406 N Marshall St. into Kim's Kids Daycare. Later they saw a need for Chapman to have a laundry mat so they converted 1/3 of the building into K & R Laundry.

""We fell in love with Chapman and Jon Londeen was a part of that"" said Johnson who also works full-time as a consultant.

Londeen's had been in the family name since 1938

Jon Londeen and his wife Kathlyn ""Kay"" owned the hardware store since 1963 after taking over the business from Jon's father Gordon who purchased the Morrison Hardware store and combined it with his furniture store in 1938. Jon passed away on Oct. 8 2020 after a 7-week battle with COVID-19.

Jon and Kay received help from all three of their children Jon D. (J.D.) Kevin and Eric who did deliveries cleaned and stocked the shelves.

""When I heard Jon Londeen had passed away I was thinking 'oh man I hope the store doesn't close'"" said Johnson. ""I started talking to their boys and we were able to make a deal.""

Londeen's customer Chad Winnie has worked in Chapman and has shopped at the store for several years.

""We need something like this I was glad to hear someone was going to take it over and keep it going. Mr. Londeen was great to work with he always had a smile on his face. He also always knew all of the small-town gossip"" said Winnie.

What changes should customers expect?

The store will be seeing some changes in the way things are on display including having aisles widened to make it easier for customers to walk through. In order to make those changes the owners decided to have a ""massive inventory reduction sale"" to help make room for the new layout.

Store manager Tammie Stoner along with Greg Perkins who has worked at Londeen's for five years have been labeling the items that will be part of the sale this past week. The store workers have put green stickers on over 4000 items that will be on sale and will continue to add more green stickers as they continue to go through the inventory.

""I love the customer service part of my job and helping the customers"" said Stoner. ""You find something new in here every day that you did not even know we had.""

The massive inventory reduction sale will start the week of Monday April 26 through Saturday May 1 with 30% off Monday May 3 through Saturday May 8 with 40% off and Monday May 10 through Saturday May 15 with 50% off.

""I still want to keep the small-town feeling and service in fact even increase the service"" said Johnson. ""I want to get it laid out more like a traditional hardware store.""

The store will be adding bar codes to the merchandise so the workers no longer will have to write down all of the items by hand.

""We are going automate some of that stuff and come into the modern age with that stuff. We are going to keep the hardwood floors and we are going to keep the small-town feeling and we are going to continue to treat people like gold"" said Rick Johnson.

More:Kansas farmers are making hops into crops. They are defying the odds of heavy soil and less daylight.

The new layout of the store is to be completed in six months to a year and will have a wall that will feature a few of the photographs of the Londeen family and Chapman memorabilia that the Johnsons' have found while going through the store.

""I want to respect the Londeen family and the tradition and keep it going"" said Johnson. ""I am 60 and will be potentially retired in three or four years so I will have a place to hang out and drink coffee.""

""You can pretty much pick what and where you want to work — there’s just so much"" said Julie Metzger Muskingum County Ohio Means Jobs supervisor.

More than 2500 jobs are up for grabs within a 20-mile radius of Zanesville according to OMJ the state of Ohio's online career counseling center that connects businesses to candidates.

It's a sign of a strong economy emerging from the pandemic officials say but local employers are struggling as they await applicants to fill open positions.

Chad Parker owner of C.P.'s Landscape and Outdoor Supply has tried everything to get his staff to full capacity as more employees have to take on overtime for-time-and-a-half pay. And he's spent thousands of dollars on advertising to find new employees.

""At this point we're paying more for less employees"" he said.

Job market emerging from pandemic

Parker said his small team is pulling 60 to 70 hours a week just to keep up with basic projects and they're still taking on less than in previous years. He's spent $8000 on advertising just to target prospective applicants.

“We’re spending an obscene amount of money"" he said adding his crew is overworked and ready for more coworkers. ""But to be honest with you it’s costing us more in overtime (employee pay).”

Metzger said employers are offering more positions than can be filled by unemployed people in the county. Both unskilled and skilled labor is needed across the county and numerous industries.

After COVID-19 prompted a statewide lockdown Muskingum County's unemployment rate reflected staggering lows across the nation. It was nearly 16% at its worst.

It's since dropped to 5.1% just 0.2% higher than pre-pandemic. The rate includes both those who receive unemployment insurance benefits and those who don't.

Now available jobs continue to grow from companies expanding and new businesses opening up.

One of OMJ's services is helping people find training opportunities to match their desired careers although Metzger said employers are having the most issues filling entry-level positions.

“But again there’s more of that demand than we have in the system to give to employers"" she said.

Big companies are also expanding and offering competitive wages. In March the Zanesville Spectrum call center opened applications for 50 positions at $18 an hour starting. AK Steel is hiring too according to a sign posted in front of its Linden Avenue plant. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

More:Spectrum raises starting wages hiring 50 in Zanesville

The call center is still seeking candidates a Charter Communications spokesman said.

Zanesville High School recently created a jobs board for existing students and alumni that lists jobs at the Dollar General distribution center. A Dollar General spokeswoman did not respond for a request for comment.

What's ahead?

It's not just entry-level jobs in demand. Information-based positions available like engineering as well as other skilled labor where employers are limited to qualified candidates. There's a push at OMJ to get candidates into nursing programs

Ohio Means Jobs largely helps re-employ people who receive unemployment insurance benefits but they also work with high school students who may soon enter the workforce. That's something Metzger sees as a way to fill vacancies.

COVID-19 numbers are also decreasing but two-thirds of county residents haven't been vaccinated yet. There's a perception that people who can work want to continue on benefits instead Metzger acknowledged but “I do think there’s really that population of people who are just scared"" she said. “They really don’t now what to think – they’re afraid.”

The plan for C.P.'s is to keep doing ads but it's getting expensive. And with the company's bottom line decreasing and employees overworked Parker is holding out for applicants.

“We’ve been a little bit luckier in the last couple weeks; we've been able to get a few more"" he said. ""We're trying everything.""

It happened on Lewis Avenue around 7:30 a.m. Sunday morning in Toledo. A car with two men believed to be in their twenties was traveling northbound on Lewis when the driver hit the railroad tracks and lost control according to Toledo Police. The car crashed into the sign of a Family Dollar store.

Both men in the crash are in serious condition. Authorities said speeding was a factor in the crash but the investigation is ongoing.

The incident happened just before 5 p.m. at the IGA on Robson Street near Richards Street police told CTV News Vancouver in an email.

Video of the incident shared on Reddit (warning: link contains profanity) begins with an altercation near the store's entrance. A man can be heard yelling profanity at the store's staff and there is a loud crash.

Later in the video a man can be seen farther inside the store swinging what appears to be a small pipe at other people in the store including one person in an IGA hat.

People in the store can be seen wrestling the man to the ground and he can be heard shouting that the store's staff started the altercation and that he is acting in self-defence.

The man is not wearing a face mask but it's not clear from the video whether B.C.'s mask mandate is a reason for the altercation.

At the end of the video police arrive and handcuff the man telling him he's under arrest.

Vancouver Police Department spokesperson Const. Tania Visintin told CTV News in an email that the man was arrested for assault with a weapon uttering threats and mischief.

""He allegedly struck one employee in the head threatened a second employee and smashed a number of flower pots"" Visintin said. ""One of the staff members was injured.""

Visintin noted that VPD officers are no strangers to the grocery store where the incident happened.

""Unfortunately this family-run business has been hit quite hard by violence in recent years and their staff are dealing with this kind of thing on a daily basis"" she said.",,,,,,,,,

DOV,Dover Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvc3RlcnMuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNC8yNC9oaXN0b3JpY2FsbHktc3BlYWtpbmctZm9sbG93aW5nLXVwLTE5MDgtbXVyZGVyLXdhbHRlci1zLXN0ZXJsaW5nLzcyODY5MjgwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historically Speaking: Following up on the 1908 murder of Walter S. Sterling,"Tony McManus

Had you been a juror in the trial for the 1908 murder of Dover police officer Walter S. Sterling you might have wondered why John Dame had been up and about at 4:15 in the morning walking around his house with a loaded revolver.

The evidence indicated that he might not have had the weapon when the argument with his father-in-law started but went back to his bedroom to get it and returned to the confrontation. You might wonder why if he felt threatened he didn't simply move more than a broom's length away and go to call the police.

On the other hand there seemed to be no question that Sterling was in an agitated state. There were several witnesses who testified as to a loud argument and threats and Dame certainly made no effort to evade his part in the end result.

And so ... jury deliberation began shortly after 1:30 p.m. on January 14 1909 and not long beyond 4 p.m. the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty. According to the news report ""There was a great outburst of applause by spectators."" Dame personally shook the hands of the jurors.

Mrs. Dame the former Grace Sterling passed away on November 28 1917 at the age of 47. John Edward lived until August of 1945 age 75.

(As a side note: it was a good year for the law firm of Hughes and KIvel. Also in 1909 it defended an Oliver Foss of Strafford on a charge of manslaughter with a similar result of a not guilty verdict.)

Going back to August 1908 there were several front page articles on the Sterling-Dame affair and one day immediately adjacent to news of the arrest and arraignment was a one paragraph notice of the death of Miss Mary Rollins at her home at 38 Summer St.

Several days later again on the front page was another one paragraph report on the funeral that was held at her home and what caught my attention was the names of the people who were listed as ""bearers."" There was Elisha Brown who we have recently met as [resident of the Strafford Banks. There was George Frost longtime judge of the Dover District Court; Dwight Hall the County Attorney; William Gilman who had been a member of the City Council and a State Representative and who at one time had been married to a Nancy Rollins the widow of John Rollins so perhaps related by marriage; W.W. Hayes a local dentist and across-the-street neighbor at 37 Summer; and a William Rollins of Somersworth. Although Mary Rollins had been a Dover resident for a number of years it was a Rev. Fulton from Somersworth who officiated and internment was in the family lot in Rollinsford.

So who was Mary Rollins? There is no occupation listed in the Dover Directories. She had resided at that address with her sisters Miss Olive and Miss Lydia neither of whom are identified as having any employment although Lydia is identified at one point as ""spinster."" It seems clear from the social standing of the bearers that Mary was ""Somebody."" The home was (and still is) one of the nicer residences in one of the better neighborhoods (possibly an Alvah Ramsdell creation).

John Dame is in the county jail. The judge who just days before sat on his arraignment and the prosecutor for the state both served as bearers for Mary Rollins. And immediately below the report of her funeral is a very brief separate article advising that Rev. E.A. Hoyt former pastor of the Peirce Memorial Church ""will conduct funeral services over the remains of Officer Walter S. Sterling"" at his home the following day at 2 p.m. noting that the service ""will be strictly private."" One interesting part of history is that there are still a number of unanswered questions.

One of those relates to the recent article on the Dover Navigation Company. One of the prominent members of that group was Zimri S. Wallingford born in Milton N.H. in 1816. One of the company's schooners bore his name. His early career was in blacksmithing but in 1844 he was working as a machinist at the Cocheco Manufacturing Co. He rose to a superintendent's position in 1849 and was named agent for the company in 1860. That allowed him to move from his then residence on the south side of the double house at 86 Locust St. (the other side was the residence of the Episcopal Minister) up the hill to ""Corporation House"" at 113 Locust which had been built by CMC in 1831 specifically as the home for its top local executive. It's likely that it was Wallingford who provided overnight accommodations for Abraham Lincoln following the latter's speech at Dover's City Hall.

Wallingford was a major player in other areas. He had an active role in creating the City's early municipal water system by way of installing a system of ""subterraneous pipes."" He was a director of the Dover & Winnipisseogee Railroad and in 1884 was president of the Dover Horse Railway (along with our old friends Harrison Haley James E. Lothrop and Charles H. Sawyer as directors). For a time he was president of the Strafford County Savings Bank. The record also indicates that he had been very active in the anti-slavery movement prior to the Civil War and reportedly friendly with William Lloyd Garrison Frederick Douglas and others.

But what was interesting to me was his somewhat unique first name so I looked it up. The reference is biblical and Zimri appears to have been a military leader who slaughtered a fairly large opposing army and supposedly left the bodies to rot on the field of battle. Having won the battle he became king but in the midst of a series of intrigues only lasted in that position for about a week and then died by his own hand. He is often described as disreputable in his dealings with others even members of his own supporters and in fact in some commentaries is a by-word for ""traitor.""

So my question would be: given this background why would anyone choose to name their child ""Zimri""? Another unanswered question but in any event our Zimri overcame his name and his early beginnings to be a force for much progress in our community. He died in 1886.

Yes THAT Elon Musk,"CNN —

Live from New York it’s … Elon Musk?

In one of the more surprising announcements in the recent history of “Saturday Night Live” the NBC variety show said Saturday that its next host will be Musk the eccentric CEO of Tesla and one of the richest people on the planet.

Miley Cyrus will be joining Musk as musical guest on May 8.

The choice of Musk is an odd one for “SNL” since the show is not known for picking hosts from the tech or business world. Also Musk has shunned the media lately.

That said the show has selected business moguls before including former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and of course former President Donald Trump (before he was president.)

Trump hosted the show multiple times including as a candidate in 2015 which caused a lot of controversy for “SNL.”

As for Musk the businessman will be able to show off his comedic chops. How exactly that plays remains to be seen but this certainly is one of the buzzier choices SNL has made lately. It will likely get people to tune in who may not normally watch the show.

Musk is no stranger to being in front of the camera. He’s popped up in Marvel’s “Iron Man 2” in a 2015 episode of “The Simpsons” and in several episode of “South Park.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWNyYXNoLTE5Mjktc2hvd3Mtc2ltaWxhcml0aWVzLXRvLXRvZGF5cy1ldXBob3JpYy1tYXJrZXQtMjAyMS00P2FtcNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWNyYXNoLTE5Mjktc2hvd3Mtc2ltaWxhcml0aWVzLXRvLXRvZGF5cy1ldXBob3JpYy1tYXJrZXQtMjAyMS00P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A book dissecting the 1929 crash shows startling similarities to today's euphoric market,"Facebook Email icon An envelope.

In ""Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929"" Maury Klein details the speculative fever that washed over markets ahead of the event.

The book reveals striking similarities to today's euphoric market which has led to soaring prices of stocks crypto and other assets.

The market opened ""like a bolt out of hell."" A ""dreaded tsunami of selling"" flooded in as panicked investors jettisoned over 16 million shares more than triple the normal daily trading volume.

Rules for traders to not ""run curse push or go coatless"" quickly went by the wayside. Mobs formed around the financial district of New York City and police were called in to control a most peculiar group of rioters — stock market investors.

The Dow Jones closed at $230 — down 23% from the opening of $299 and nearly 40% from record highs of $381.17.

The day was ""Black Tuesday"" October 29 1929.

It wasn't the start of the crash but it was the nail in the coffin. Fortunes were lost in a matter of hours and the US economy came crashing down hand in hand with the irrational exuberance of the 1920's.

The great depression began and by July 8 1932 the Dow fell to just $41.22 as investors lost faith in Wall Street.

In ""Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929"" Maury Klein dissects the 1929 stock market crash elaborating human stories that reveal the speculative fever of an era and perhaps even more importantly illustrate startling similarities to today's euphoric markets.

Below Insider details four examples of how history may be repeating itself based on episodes from the 1929 crash described in Klein's book.

More new listings than ever before

""New listings on the New York Stock Exchange rose from 58 million shares in 1925 to 102 million in 1928.""

In 1929 new listings on the New York Stock Exchange hit record levels as the exuberance surrounding Wall Street reached a fever pitch.

While there are many differences between the era of the 1929 crash and present day the rise of new listings is a similarity that can't be denied.

In the first quarter of this year IPO volumes rose 85% and proceeds jumped some 271% year-over-year according to the Ernst & Young Global IPO Trends: Q1 2021 report.

The rise of special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs has added to the boom in new listings.

SPAC IPO issuance broke records in the first quarter of 2021 with 298 SPACs raising nearly $88 billion according to data from ICR Capital.

The rise of the inexperienced speculators and traders

""To practiced eyes they represented a new breed of gambler lured to the market more by hope than experience like vacationers at a casino trying their luck in a game owned by professionals...Suckers are born every minute. One goes two come in. Win or lose we get our commissions.""

In the late 1920s the ranks of investors on Wall Street ballooned to record numbers.

Brokerage houses opened 599 new offices in 1928 and 1929 alone bringing the total number of New York brokerage offices to over 1600 in the days before ""Black Tuesday"" more than double the number that were operating in 1925.

Women who hadn't previously been allowed in brokerage houses also became top customers before the 1929 crash.

One female trader wrote about her reasoning for entering the markets in a ""how-to"" article that perfectly illustrates the sentiment of the era ""we went for the same reason that most of the other little pigs were going—that is because we wanted to make some money quickly without working for it.""

In 2021 trading apps like Robinhood E*trade and Fidelity which serve as the brokerage houses of our time are booming like never before. Charles Schwab added a record 3.2 million new brokerage accounts in the first quarter more than it did in all of 2020.

Reddit's r/wallstreetbets a home for retail traders and the same type of speculative attitude seen in the late 1920's has also seen its ranks swell to nearly 10 million members.

Meanwhile institutional buy-side trading has fallen to just over 25% of total equity trading volume down from highs of over 40% less than five years ago.

And retail trading volume has gone from around 10% of total equity trading in 2010 to nearly 25% in 2021 according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.

Record levels of borrowing to invest and trade

""Broker's loans which stood at nearly $3.7 billion in march 1928 reached a record $4.56 billion by June 6.""

Broker's took out loans to fund margin accounts for clients in the 1920's. It was a great business at least until it all came crashing down.

In 2021 brokers are again dishing out record levels of debt to traders. FINRA margin debt hit a record-high $813 billion in February nearly doubling from last years' $545 billion figure.

Once again investors are placing bets with the house's money however this time there is one clear difference — savings.

Consumers have stockpiled some $5.4 trillion in savings since the Coronavirus began per the Financial Times. Still the similarities between trader's margin trading habits in 1929 and today are undeniably similar.

The Federal Reserve's easy money policies

""Benjamin Strong had already advanced the New York's bank rate to 4.5 percent in May. Two months later it joined eight other Federal Reserve banks in moving to 5 percent but some thought the reversal of the easy-money policy of 1927 came too late.""

Benjamin Strong was the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 14 years until his death in October of 1928 roughly one year before ""Black Tuesday.""

Strong maintained so-called ""easy money"" low-interest-rate policies for far longer than many economists of the 20's hoped. The Governor cut the Fed's discount rate 0.5% in 1927 angering US President Herbert Hoover.

Strong also insisted on purchases of United States government securities by federal reserve banks which carried their holdings from $300000000 in May 1928 to $600000000 in December.

Economists like Murray Rothbard have criticized Strong for his ""market manipulations"" claiming he was a main cause of the Great Depression.

In 2021 Jerome Powell has pledged to maintain ultralow interest rates and continue hefty asset purchases until ""substantial further progress has been made"" toward employment and inflation goals.

The Fed's total assets have also increased from $4.1 trillion to nearly $8 trillion since the start of 2020 alone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXp6LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMjUvZG93LWpvbmVzLXRoZS1zcC01MDAtYW5kLW5hc2RhcS1yZW1haW4taW4tYS1idWxsLW1hcmtldC1kZXNwaXRlLXRheC13b3JyaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow Jones the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain in a bull market despite tax worries,"Wall Street’s three main indexes ended higher on Friday as companies continued to report strong first-quarter earnings.

The U.S. President Joe Biden is planning a tax hike of up to 39.6% on those with income over $1 million which may negatively affect the stock market.

“There’s also uncertainty over what will ultimately pass Congress; some congressional Democrats not to mention most Republicans are likely to oppose the proposed increase. There’s uncertainty over when the tax would be likely to take effect but the rate would likely rise to 28% rather than the proposed 39.6%” Goldman Sachs reported.

On the other side the global battle against the coronavirus continues and the Federal Reserve will probably keep interest rates unchanged in 2021. The U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic faster than lots of other countries and the country published better than expected data last week.

The U.S. reported the preliminary estimates of April PMIs and it is important to say that the manufacturing index hit 60.6 while the service index hit 60.4. The U.S. policymakers said they would focus on ensuring that the labor market makes a full recovery despite inflation worries.

If the price falls below 4000 points it would be a strong “sell” signal and we have the open way to 3900 or even 3800 points.

Conservationists are fighting plans to extend Long Valley Road south into desert tortoise habitat to provide a second entrance to the subdivision.

St. George Utah • With construction of the approved Northern Corridor highway through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area looming advocates for protected land staying protected are also objecting to another road project set to encroach on habitat for sensitive species.

The Long Valley Road extension project aims to connect a planned housing development west of Sand Hollow Reservoir in Washington City to the Southern Parkway by extending the existing Long Valley Road through a corner of what is now the Warner Ridge Fort Pearce Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC).

This 4000-acre patch of protected land northeast of the airport was set aside in 1999 for the endangered dwarf bear claw poppy the threatened Siler pincushion cactus important riparian habitats and historical sites as well as due to its highly erodible soils the Spectrum newspaper reported. Conservationists say it is also potential habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise which already faces encroachment on its once-protected territory by the Northern Corridor highway.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) St. George Field Office paved the way for the road to be built with a Nov. 10 Finding of No Significant Impact on the environment absolving them of the federally-mandated requirement to conduct a full study of the risks in preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement as part of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).

But opponents say the BLM failed to consider reasonable alternatives a step also required by NEPA that could avoid damage to the ACEC by simply moving the planned interchange north 0.7 of a mile.

“It was obvious there were alternatives that were not analyzed” said Tom Butine board president of the local organization Conserve Southwest Utah. “So we suggested one that moved the planned intersection two-thirds of a mile north to avoid the ACEC altogether. The topography is the same. BLM still has jurisdiction in that area. The cost has got to be less since it’s a shorter road. It seems like an obvious alternative.”

Butine submitted this suggestion as a public comment during the environmental review process for the project asking the BLM to consider this route. The BLM responded by citing the Utah Department of Transportation’s (UDOT) pre-determined locations for potential future interchanges on the same date that it elected to approve the right-of-way application for their original preferred route.

“Currently UDOT has no plans for the construction of any additional interchanges that would result in a shorter access road being constructed” the final Environmental Assessment reads. “Consideration of any such interchange would require an application from a qualified proponent who would then plan and pay for the interchange.”

Kevin Kitchen UDOT Communications Manager for this region confirmed that specific future interchange locations designated in the 2005 Environmental Impact Statement conducted for the Southern Parkway could have guided current plans for where the Long Valley Road will connect. But he also indicated that considering alternatives would only require authorization from the state transportation agency something he had not heard of as having been considered.

“When we laid out the Southern Parkway we designated specific areas where there could be potential future interchanges” explained Kitchen. “We’d have to sign off on some kind of approval for [a different] connection.”

The Southern Parkway has existing interchanges at mile markers 10 (Warner Valley/Washington Fields) and 15 (Washington Dam/Long Valley). Butine’s proposed route places the new interchange between them at mile marker 13 while the BLM-preferred route crosses the ACEC to connect at mile marker 12.3 near another subdivision on the other side of the parkway.

When asked about whether the alternate route proposed by Conserve Southwest Utah had ever been seriously considered Christian Venhuizen spokesperson for the BLM Utah Color Country District pointed back to Annex E of the Long Valley Road Environmental Assessment which says that such an action would require “an application from a qualified proponent.” This section also reads that “The BLM evaluated potential reasonable alternatives” but Butine says he’s never seen any documentation of this which should be required under NEPA laws.

When asked about how the decision was made to permit a road to cross a protected Area of Critical Environmental Concern Venhuizen responded that “This decision has been appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals and due to its status we will not provide further comment on pending litigation.”

That’s because Butine along with Washington County resident environmental activist and former BLM employee Richard Spotts submitted their questions and objections about the Long Valley Road as a new appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals on April 7th asking for construction to be delayed until reasonable alternatives could be adequately considered.

But they’re not at all sure it’s going to work.

“A lot of people have told us that it’s a real long shot to get this board to grant stays” Spotts said. “And sometimes this board doesn’t act in a very timely way. The tortoises could be removed and some of the roadwork could occur even before we get a decision. And after they’ve removed the tortoises and bladed the road and buried the seed bank for the dwarf bear claw poppy it’s kind of a moot point beyond that even if we win on paper.”

The November document granting the project its right of way outlines a construction schedule starting with grading and utility installation under the road in the spring of 2021. Butine said he worries that the local BLM operates under a policy of “ask forgiveness rather than permission” and that by the time the court rules on their appeal the damage to the ACEC and its sensitive species would already be done.

“Since we suspect the bulldozers are going to be out within a month we were worried about whether if we submit a stay right now is the court going to be able to get to it in time to stop action” Butine said. “The preliminary word on that is that the court has become so understaffed and backlogged with a record number of appeals during the Trump administration that they’re now trying to determine if there’s any way they could get to our petition for a stay. It’s starting to look a little bleak for actually getting them to stop.”

Butine and Spotts’ appeal leans heavily on protections for the Mojave desert tortoise citing risks to that species 78 times in their 30-page statement of reasons even though the Warner Ridge Fort Pearce ACEC was designated specifically for the protection of the dwarf bear claw poppy and the Siler pincushion cactus. But they say the bigger issue is a troubling pattern of behavior by local government agencies of ignoring federal mandates to protect land and species in favor of constant development.

“It’s clearly tiny compared to the Northern Corridor in terms of impacts. But the similarities are that the BLM basically abdicated any independent authority or analysis” Spotts said. “Because UDOT says we want to put a future interchange at this specific place on the Southern Parkway and Washington City decides this road needs to go through habitat that was established with the Dixie Resource Management Plan in 1999 we just do that? Once BLM designates ACECs they should stand up for them.”

There is a precedent for BLM engaging in seemingly contradictory actions in regards to protecting this ACEC under their management. In March 2016 the local BLM office renewed a ten-year permit allowing livestock grazing within the Warner Ridge Fort Pearce ACEC despite acknowledging that the area had been protected due to two federally-listed delicate plant species and “highly erodible soils.” As a mitigating solution they proposed “establishing long-term study plots to monitor the general health of individual plants and any noticeable effects of grazing activities.”

Butine says the fate of the tortoises now lies with Washington City which he fears “is unwilling to wait for the appeal process.” Meanwhile Washington City Public Works Director Mike Shaw told The Spectrum & Daily News that his office “does not have a Long Valley Road extension project.” Progress on building the road he says is entirely up to the subdivision developer listed on the right-of-way decision record as Brennan Holdings LLC.

Furthermore Shaw said “there are no tortoise out there that I’m aware of and it’s not even really good poppy habitat because they’re usually on gypsum soils.” He also expressed confidence in the federal process stating that “If (the project) was actually in the area of concern the BLM would never have issued a permit for it.”

The BLM’s own documents acknowledge that the road will cross the ACEC but they argue that the project is an overall win for the desert tortoise because it is the result of a land exchange that allowed Washington County to acquire a private parcel of land within the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area prime tortoise habitat by trading these formerly-BLM-controlled lands off of the Southern Parkway.

“The Red Cliffs/Long Valley Land Exchange decision in October 2016 allowed the BLM to acquire more than 83 acres of privately-held lands in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve for the protection and recovery of the threatened Mojave desert tortoise” Venhuizen said.

There are no clear answers yet as to whether or when the Long Valley Road extension project will proceed. Bulldozers sit idly at the entrance to Holdings’ planned 2000-unit subdivision. Meanwhile road grading for the widening of the Southern Parkway — which already cuts through a corner of the ACEC — is underway to accommodate increased traffic along this road as housing subdivisions fill in on either side.

“Our spectacular outdoor environment is the driver of our growth in population tourism and economy” Butine said. “Yet this growth is being managed in a way that is destroying our scenic and sensitive landscapes the very reason people value this area bit by bit.”

Pensacola News Journal

State Rep. Michelle Salzman is done waiting for Skanska to do the right thing so she has gone directly to Gov. Ron DeSantis to seek Florida's help on behalf of thousands of local citizens and businesses who have been hurt by the devastating damages and repair delays to the Gen. Chappie James Bridge over Pensacola Bay.

As reported by the PNJ's Emma Kennedy Salzman sent a letter to DeSantis last week asking that the governor and attorney general use the state's leverage to push the multi-national construction company to respond to local citizens something it has so far been unwilling to do. Part of that leverage includes the state's ability to restrict Skanska from other major infrastructure projects until the company sets things right by citizens in Pensacola and Gulf Breeze.

Rep. Michelle Salzman urges DeSantis to blacklist Skanska until bridge repaired community 'whole'

""As we head into another hurricane season we cannot trust Skanska to ensure this will not happen again. We just cannot take that risk"" Salzman's letter reads.

Salzman credits state Sen. Doug Broxson for working tirelessly to provide oversight to the bridge repairs. Broxson has been the point person between FDOT and Skanska on behalf of taxpayers. He has attended regular briefings and site inspections and has invested himself deeply in the bridge-repair process just as voters would expect their elected representative would do.

After multiple delays the repaired span is currently set to reopen by Memorial Day weekend although it's extremely tough for locals to trust any promises at this point.

Meanwhile residents and businesses in Gulf Breeze and Pensacola continue to suffer. But instead of being a proactive partner with these residents Skanska has sought to shirk responsibility for harm that was a clear and direct result of the company's negligence during a hurricane.

In the face of numerous lawsuits Skanska has moved to drastically limit its financial liability by shifting the legal cases from the state level to a federal court where it hopes to hide behind an obscure centuries-old maritime shipping law that should have no bearing on a bridge-building company in 2021.

►Rep. Michelle Salzman urges DeSantis to blacklist Skanska until bridge repaired community 'whole'

►Broxson will tour Pensacola Bay Bridge every two weeks to ensure Skanska stays on track

Skanska has also attempted to delay and postpone court action a tactic U.S. District Court Judge Roger Vinson recently rejected. Vinson said there is a pressing need for the community to get a swift resolution in this case and he plans to rule in early July on whether Skanska's duplicitous ploy will stand or if the cases can rightfully proceed back in state court where they belong.

Skanska is a multi-national corporation with annual revenue in the billions. It has hired Pensacola law firm Clark-Partington in an attempt to avoid virtually all responsibility for the financial damages it caused to local businesses workers and the community as a whole.

Whatever Vinson rules any potential settlements or legal resolutions could still be many months or even years away. But in the meantime there's nothing preventing Skanska from doing the right thing and taking responsibility for the widespread physical and financial damages that resulted from its runaway barges.

""Truly I think we've just been patient enough as a community"" Salzman said. ""I know the DOT have done all they can and our senator (Doug Broxson) has done all he can … who else has authority?"" she asked.

Salzman confirmed to the PNJ that she had an initial meeting with DeSantis' staff on Wednesday to discuss the issues raised in her letter. She said a follow-up meeting was planned after the governor could be briefed on the matter. And next Tuesday Salzman is also scheduled to meet with Attorney General Ashley Moody as well.

Sen. Broxson has also had recent discussions with the governor so DeSantis is certainly aware of local residents' pressing need for assistance from the state.

State lobbying records show that Skanska had hired multiple lobbyists who were registered to meet with elected officials in Tallahassee and lobby on transportation issues.

When asked by the PNJ Rep. Alex Andrade refused to join Salzman in sending a letter to DeSantis. After initially taking an aggressive tone against Skanska last fall Andrade has since softened his stance noticeably. It's disappointing that when it comes to an issue of such clear and unified local interest Andrade would not join Salzman and Broxson in asking Gov. DeSantis and Attorney General Moody to help fight on behalf of local citizens in his own district.

Skanska's harm to Pensacola and Gulf Breeze is vast and ongoing. Local taxpayers haven't asked for anything more than proper repairs to the bridge and that the company do right by the people who were hurt by its irresponsible and dangerous decisions.

From the moment the hurricane hit Skanska's handling of its barge debacle has been a slap-in-the-face to locals. People here in Pensacola and Gulf Breeze feel that sting every time they are stuck in traffic on the Garçon Point Bridge. We feel that sting every time another business closes cuts costs or lays off workers in Pensacola or Gulf Breeze. And we feel that sting every time Skanska avoids public accountability or attempts to evade liability for all the damage it has done.

That's why it's so important that Salzman and Broxson are engaging Gov. DeSantis and seeking the help of the state. We understand if elected officials in distant Tallahassee don't feel the same insulting sting that folks are experiencing every day here in Pensacola. So it's crucial that our own representatives speak candidly and convey that insult on our behalf.

Maybe it's unsurprising that an international company with billions in annual revenue would ignore and insult local residents. But let us all see if the company is so bold and callous when the state of Florida gets involved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVybG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYXByLzI0L3RvcC1mbGFnbGVyLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXNhbGUtZ29sZi1jb3Vyc2UtaG9tZS1mb3ItZG9sbGFyMS0wNS1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Flagler real estate sale: Golf course home for $1.05 million,"A house in Hammock Beach was the top real estate transaction for the week of March 18-24 in Flagler County in the Multiple Listing Service.

The event was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 lockdown but the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy brought it back this year partnering with the Detroit River Coalition a group of organizations throughout southeast Michigan that share a goal to preserve the Detroit River.

“Not only is it Earth Week but it’s also a time of year where people are ready to get back outside and it’s been a long winter on the cut” said Renee Rodriquez program manager for the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy. “ ... A lot of the litter accumulates down here because it’s below street level.”

Volunteer Christina Ilijanic of Plymouth brought her daughters Caroline 5 and Eve 4. They picked up trash in a section of the greenway along an grassy embankment.

“I think it’s important for them to give back early and to instill that in them relatively young” said Ilijanic a longtime volunteer with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy and a General Motors Co. employee.

“This is an activity that you can make fun for little kids. … It’s also important for them to understand the impact of the decisions we make. We picked up some things that we have eaten before. Like a Doritos bag. This is why we have to be careful about what we do with our trash and what we buy.”

The steep terrain turned into an adventure for the girls.

“I like going up the hill” Caroline said.

With some help from her daughters Ilijanic filled a large garbage bag.

“It’s our job to be the stewards particularly around the river and the water” she said. “There are so many reasons. It keeps it pretty the environment clean. It keeps the animals safe and it keeps the water clean too because the only other place that all this stuff is going is to the river. If you can keep a garbage bag of plastic out of the river even better.”

In recent years the cleanup has included several streets along the greenway. Volunteers include employees from DTE Energy and General Motors and others who frequent the greenway.

“They’re regular users they come down on weekends” Rodriquez said. “Because ... they want to give back. They want to see it kept clean.”

Alexis Holley 16 said she's visited the greenway before and chose the cleanup as a volunteer activity to fulfill some service hours for high school.

The Warren teen and her father Fernandez Holley picked up trash in a gravel and grass parking area near the Dequindre Cut entrance at Gratiot. They filled their bags with bottles cans paper and a lot of cigarettes she said.

Concerts are making a comeback in the country music industry and Chris Stapleton is tacking on a few more dates to his upcoming All American Road Show tour.

The singer announced the addition of 18 more shows on social media with the dates scattered around the country. Many of these new shows feature cities not originally planned for on the road with places like Virginia Beach VA Tampa FL and Birmingham AL getting the Stapleton treatment within the coming months.

The All-American Road Show will host several guests along the way. Stapleton’s latest post confirmed cameos from Caylee Hammack Dwight Yoakam Elle King Jamey Johnson Kendall Marvel Margo Price Mavis Staples Nikki Lane Sheryl Crow The Dirty Knobs with Mike Campbell The Highwomen The Marcus King Band Willie Nelson and Yola.

Stapleton has had to push his tour back a few times due to the COVID-19 pandemic but has been proactive in letting his fans know all changes with the tour and offering refunds to those unable to make future dates.

The “Starting Over” singer most recently performed during the 56th Annual ACM Awards with the help of Miranda Lambert who stepped in for Stapleton’s wife Morgane at the last minute.

Fans who want to go to one of Stapleton’s newly announced shows can buy tickets starting on Friday April 30.

SALISBURY — Growing up in his mother’s kitchen on West Monroe Street Carlton Jackson Jr. wanted to be a professional cook.

“My mother was a cook — a really good cook” Jackson said. “She worked in the kitchen at the country club in the kitchen in First Methodist Church downtown. I would help her and I was always interested in cooking.”

Jackson and his mother a native of Puerto Rico prepared Latin American dishes like the kind she ate as a child. To this day Jackson still cooks many of those same dishes for his family. But replicating his mom’s signature recipes was and still is challenging for Jackson. She was the kind of cook who was more likely to rely on her intuition and taste buds than a measuring cup.

“She always operated on a ‘little bit of this a pinch of that add some more of that’ kind of approach to cooking” Jackson said. “To try to boil that down to a recipe was difficult but some of the things I really liked I made my own notes.”

Inspired by his mom Jackson asked to be a cook when he enlisted in the Army after graduating from Salisbury High School in 1975.

His superiors had other ideas.

“I was told that I had skills that would be more suited for something other than being a cook” Jackson said. “I ended up being an accounting specialist.”

By putting Jackson’s mind to use outside of the kitchen his presiding officers nudged him down a different career path. He never became a chef but he did serve several years in the military earned an engineering degree and recently celebrated his 40th year at Duke Energy.

After starting at the energy company as an engineering aid Jackson rose through the ranks and now serves as design manager for the company’s lighting design programs branch covering a swath of west central North Carolina and the Palmetto-Peedee Territory in South Carolina. In his spare time Jackson enjoys a variety of musical and artistic hobbies but is also focused on improving the town he grew up in and still calls home.

“I love Salisbury. I always have” Jackson said. “I’ve spent time in a number of places primarily through military travel. I was in Virginia South Carolina Texas out in California but the old saying is ‘There’s no place like home.’ For me that is true.”

Jackson had an opportunity to make Copperas Cove Texas his home after he was discharged from the Army. A business owner in the town which is not far from where Jackson had been stationed in Fort Hood extended him a job offer. Jackson turned it down instead deciding to return to Salisbury to care for his ailing father.

Looking for work back in his hometown Jackson found it in a familiar place — the kitchen. Bud Mickle a family friend and the owner of a local tire shop secured him a job at Bamby’s Bakery downtown.

Once again Jackson was told by a supervisor — this one wearing chef’s clothes instead of a camouflage uniform — that his skills could be put to better use.

“I had a supervisor there who said ‘You know you seem to have an analytic mind. You should consider doing something in the engineering field’” Jackson said.

Jackson took that advice and earned an associate’s degree in industrial management and engineering technology.

In search of a job in the engineering field Jackson was again aided by Mickle who he said he’ll be “forever grateful to.” Mickle lined up an interview for Jackson with Duke Energy and Jackson was brought on as an engineering aid responsible for meeting with customers to discuss installations. Jackson climbed the ranks eventually earning the title of senior engineering technologist for the company.

In his career with Duke Energy he’s designed electrical infrastructure for the VA hospital Gildan and Food Lion warehouses. As part of the company’s power quality reliability and integrity team Jackson has worked to diagnose what went wrong during major power outages and how to fix them in the future.

As Jackson made a career for himself with Duke Energy he started to become worried about the place where he was raising his family.

“In the late ’80s early ’90s our community was being ravaged by crack” Jackson said. “I worried about the impact on my children. It was important to me to know they were OK and safe.”

Jackson became involved with Salisbury’s efforts to improve and revitalize the West End community where he’d grown up. He led a community cleanup and helped encourage teens and children through the West End Youth Action Committee.

Jackson’s work on the West End led to other community involvement opportunities across the city.

Jackson has served on the board for Waterworks Visual Arts Center and Rowan Helping Ministries as a member of the Community Appearance Commission and helped with Rowan-Salisbury School’s School to Work Program. His proudest accomplishment Jackson said was receiving the Martin Luther King Humanitarian Award for Community Service in 1995.

Former Salisbury Mayor Margaret Kluttz said she’s watched Jackson work “quietly and unassumingly” for decades to make the city a better place.

“He’s had such a rich impact on our community over a period of time and he’s never looked for pats on the back” Kluttz said. “He’s sincerely found a way to use his influence in important ways.”

Along the way Jackson has also ingrained himself in Salisbury’s artistic community. At just 5 years old he was taught how to play the drums by his uncle who started with kitchen utensils.

“My uncle was a Latin percussionist and he came to live with us here and he put on records and I actually learned to play on my mom’s pots and pans because I didn’t have any drums” Jackson said. “My uncle told me ‘Now when you get real proficient on those pots we’ll look at getting you a set.’ For my eighth birthday he got me a set of bongos.”

Jackson has been playing them ever since. As a member of The Brubakers band he’s opened for the Charlotte Symphony multiple times. He’s also one of 13 members of the local musical group Motel Soap.

Along the way Jackson added painting and drawing to his repertoire. His interest in art was peaked after watching a PBS painting special by Bill Alexander. He started with a basic acrylic paint set but has since had some of his paintings showcased in galleries around the region.

Jackson has never been afraid of pursuing his passions. It’s part of his “learn to swim” approach to life.

“You can walk around the swimming pool all day you can stick a foot in the water hang your legs in the water but you will never swim until you jump in” Jackson said. “That’s been my approach to everything I’ve tried to do. You’ve got to start somewhere so the best place to start is wherever you’re at.”

With his eye on retirement in the coming years Jackson said he’d like to eventually open a small art shop downtown.

Jackson lives in Salisbury with his wife Shirley who he said is his biggest supporter. They have five children four of whom still live in Salisbury.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Y3BvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaS10ZWFtL21vbnRocy1hZnRlci1jb2FsLXBsYW50LWRlbW9saXRpb25zLXdhc3RlLXN0aWxsLXNpdHMtaW4tb2hpby1yaXZlci1hcy1hcm15LWNvcnBzLW9yZGVycy1jbGVhbnVw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It never should have been taken down ever with explosives',"NEW RICHMOND Ohio — Clermont County residents were shocked in February when a smokestack from the retired Walter C. Beckjord power plant toppled into the Ohio River.

But emails obtained by the WCPO 9 I-Team show that wasn’t the first time demolition crews left bricks mortar and pieces of metal in the water.

Now the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has ordered contractors to clean up the mess it made in a river that provides drinking water for 5 million people and serves as the recreational play area for thousands of boaters tubing children and jet skiers during the summer.

In an April 15 compliance letter to MCM Management Corp. the federal agency ordered the company to submit a clean-up plan by the end of April and remove an estimated 75 cubic yards of demolition debris from the river within 30 days of the plan’s approval.

This comes three months after Clermont County and Pierce Township officials first complained to state and federal agencies about waste debris in the river at Beckjord.

“I do have huge concerns” said Pierce Township fire Chief Craig Wright. “It’s not just Clermont County’s drinking water it’s the city of Cincinnati’s and Hamilton County’s and Northern Kentucky’s. It’s much larger than just us.”

As the nation transitions away from coal the colossal plants that burn it are being shuttered up and down the Ohio River. Ohio has more coal plant closures and retirement announcements than any other state in the nation according to the Sierra Club.

This leaves more questions than answers in the communities left behind. Perhaps the biggest ones: How will the sites be cleaned up? And who is monitoring them?

Lot Tan Debris in the Ohio River at the former Beckjord coal plant site on April 20 2021.

After a year of asking those very questions about Beckjord Clermont County and Pierce Township officials said they still don’t have many answers.

""If we acquire a house and burn it down for training for our firefighters I have to get more permits than what are needed to demolish and implode a power plant” Wright said.

Wright is worried about his drinking water. As the summer boating season approaches he also fears curious boaters could be injured by falling debris that hangs over the river at Beckjord or strike debris hidden underneath the water.

""The big deal is the same people who appear to be having these mishaps that are non-regulated are the same people that control a catastrophic amount of fly ash perched on the river” said environmental attorney Dave Altman. “How much are you going to allow this company to get away with without the scrutiny that it deserves?""

Lot Tan Environmental attorney Dave Altman

Fly ash is a by-product of burning coal which the U.S. EPA states on its website contains contaminants such as mercury and arsenic.

Altman represents more than 100 New Richmond residents in a federal lawsuit filed in December 2019 against site owner Commercial Liability Partners. It argues that the developer breached a 1986 agreement with then Beckjord owner Cincinnati Gas and Electric that allegedly entitles residents to more information about contaminated waste disposal.

An attorney for Clermont County Scott Doran wrote to the U.S. EPA last December asking for more oversight at Beckjord which he described as a “danger to human health and the environment” because the coal ash is stored in unlined leaking ponds covering over 200 acres.

Emily Maxwell | WCPO An aerial view of a coal yard next to an open coal ash pond at the Beckjord power plant.

Some say the delayed cleanup of demolition waste in the Ohio River highlights a bigger problem about lack of oversight at the now-dormant plant which is known as a legacy site because federal rules overseeing coal combustion residuals that took effect in 2015 do not apply.

But Commercial Liability Partners said its contractors “followed best practices by a highly experienced demolition contractor and we worked collaboratively with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Ohio EPA and local emergency and transportation officials to ensure a successful demolition.”

‘Fully engaged with local officials’

Built in the 1950s as a coal-burning giant the plant pumped electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across Southwest Ohio for decades.

In 2014 Duke Energy closed the Beckjord power plant where more than 5 million tons of coal ash are buried in unlined man-made ponds along the Ohio River.

Duke sold the 1443-acre site in 2018 to Commercial Liability Partners which is demolishing the plant with plans to build an industrial park green space and port terminal.

Emily Maxwell | WCPO The W.C. Beckjord Station a closed Duke Energy power plant located 20 miles east of Cincinnati contains more than 10 billion pounds of toxins that are packed into ponds along the banks of the Ohio River.

In a permit application to the Corps of Engineers CLP’s demolition contractor MCM Management assured the agency that no debris would enter the Ohio River.

In an October 2019 application letter from MCM vice president of demolition operations Aaron Fitch stated that a barge with a 15-foot-high backstop would be used to contain any falling debris and that demolition would take place in the summer or fall when the Ohio River is at a low stage.

Neither of those things happened.

The contractor later determined that using a barge “would not be feasible” and it is “not a required permit condition” to demolish the smokestack during low river stage a Corps spokesman told WCPO.

Commercial Liability Partners which owns the former Beckjord site did not respond to requests for an interview.

CLP did provide a statement that said in part: “Our teams and our contractors have been fully engaged with local officials and regulators who have overseen major milestones and ongoing work at the site.”

But emails WCPO obtained through a public records request reveal tense and sometimes confrontational exchanges between local officials and Beckjord’s contractors. They began when contractors announced via a March 27 2020 email that demolitions would begin in early May at Beckjord.

“I will not support or sign off on this in any way unless several things were to happen” Wright replied hours later on March 27 to Rhonda Reed project manager for Devon Industrial Group which is working on the Beckjord project. “There would need to be clear and open communication between all parties and partners involved and that obviously hasn’t occurred up to this point.”

Follow-up emails show that local officials tried to get Devon to delay the demolition at Beckjord due to fears about COVID in light of Ohio stay-at-home orders that closed all non-essential business.

Officials even turned to Clermont County Prosecuting Attorney Ernie Ramos for help.

“The question remains is there anything that the county can do to encourage/force CLP to hold off on any demolition work until the current emergency has ended” Clermont County Emergency Management director Pam Haverkos wrote in an April 1 email to Ramos. “The Beckjord property has a class 1 dam that holds back coal ash. If breached this could be an environmental disaster that we will not have the resources to respond to effectively.”

But Wright said he and other local officials quickly learned that they had virtually no authority over what happened at the Beckjord site.

“It’s still technically classified as a public utility … so it's exempt from building codes"" Wright said. ""It’s exempt from a good portion of the fire code. The things that give me my authority and jurisdiction they’re mostly exempt from.”

What he ‘didn’t expect to find’

Emails from Clermont County building and permit officials confirm that demolitions at Beckjord are exempt from local jurisdiction and emails from the state fire marshal’s office confirm that explosives permits were not needed because the explosives were stored in a Department of Transportation-permitted transport vehicle.

Beckjord contractors did provide Wright with safety and demolition plans maps of road and water closures and communication contacts.

But emails show that Wright argued with contractors about notifying the public allowing local officials to attend the demolition and using a Clermont County Sheriff’s Department drone to check for curiosity seekers.

The May 8 2020 demolition of precipitators and turbine roof units at the plant went off smoothly and for months afterward Wright said he had little contact with Beckjord contractors.

Contractors initially planned to use explosives to demolish another portion of the plant for October or November 2020 but emails obtained by WCPO reveal that it was canceled because they could not secure explosives.

Then in January a Pierce Township trustee alerted Wright that residents were complaining about large amounts of construction debris in the Ohio River at Beckjord.

Wright took his camera and zoom lens to the shores of Melbourne Kentucky directly across the Ohio River from Beckjord where he took dozens of photos.

“I didn’t expect to find that kind of debris in the river itself” Wright said. “They’re using equipment to push debris and stuff around the site so it was piled rather high on the side … but I honestly can’t say if it was pushed in there or if it just slid down or how it ended up there.”

But Wright added that “it did not appear” contractors at Beckjord were actively trying to prevent debris from going into the Ohio River.

Wright sent those photos to local officials who in turn sent emails to the Ohio EPA U.S. EPA Corps of Engineers U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies asking for help.

“Attached are pictures of the debris being pushed into the Ohio River at the Beckjord plant” Haverkos the county’s emergency management director wrote in a Jan. 19 email to the Ohio EPA.

What was the Ohio EPA’s response?

“Agency staff went to the site on Jan. 22 confirmed that debris from the demolition was in the river. Ohio EPA followed up by contacting the Corps of Engineers and the demolition contractor about the issue” according to an Ohio EPA spokesperson.

But the debris was still not cleaned up.

“I reached out to anybody and everybody that I could think of that could provide some help to us” Wright said.

What’s in the water?

More debris fell into the Ohio River on Feb. 26 when contractors used explosives to demolish the largest smokestack at Beckjord. The top portion of the stack fell into the river with a thunderous splash.

A Corps of Engineers spokesman said 75 cubic yards of debris fell into the river from that demolition based on estimates provided by MCM. That’s 45000 pounds or 22.5 tons or enough to fill 2.5 commercial construction dumpsters.

But Chris Wessels owner of Interstate Stack and Chimney Services believes much more debris from that smokestack is in the river than what MCM is reporting.

“I would say almost the whole chimney is in that Ohio River” Wessels said. “And whatever contamination was in that chimney that went in that river has probably been washed down the river by now.”

Lot Tan Chris Wessels owner of Interstate Stack & Chimney Services.

Wessels has been repairing and demolishing industrial and utility chimneys across the nation for more than 40 years.

He said contractors invited him to the Beckjord site last spring to bid on the demolition of smaller steel stacks. Wessels did not end up performing work at Beckjord. But while on site he took photos of and asked questions about the largest concrete smokestack in anticipation of possibly bidding on that job he said.

“It never should have been taken down ever with explosives … because you can’t control where that chimney is going to fall” Wessels said.

Wessels said a chimney of that size standing at more than 400 feet tall should have been taken down in a controlled piecemeal manner using scaffolding and a team of workers. But that would have been more expensive and taken several weeks.

Was the smokestack clean?

“I am still very curious if that chimney was ever inspected before it was demolished” Wessels said. “Because typically on the inside of that chimney in the fly ash and based on the fuels that were burned there’s contaminants.”

Wessels asked if the largest smokestack had been cleaned but he said contractors never gave him an answer.

Ohio regulations require that asbestos be removed from structures before demolition and that did happen at Beckjord according to an October 2019 application letter by MCM to the Corps.

But other materials besides asbestos are not regulated according to an Ohio EPA spokesperson.

So it is unlikely that public records exist that reveal whether the Beckjord smokestack contained coal ash or other pollutants or if it was cleaned before it imploded and fell into the river because contractors do not need to provide that documentation to regulators.

“The Beckjord power plant has been decommissioned coal ash removed and asbestos abated” Fitch wrote in a permit application to the Corps signed in February 2020 which did not contain test results.

Based on documentation it received from the contractor a Corps of Engineers spokesman said any debris in the Ohio River is simply ""brick and mortar.""

But Altman the environmental attorney isn’t so sure.

“You’ve got all the heavy metals just for starters – mercury and nickel and the whole list of heavy metals depending on where the coal came from” Altman said. “This would have had decades of such residues built up inside the stack.”

Courtesy: Chris Wessels Smokestacks at Beckjord in Spring 2020 before demolition.

Federal law has banned companies from putting smokestacks into rivers since 1899 Altman said.

“This was a violation of potentially the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act” Altman said. “But nobody seems to care about this at least at the federal level or perhaps at the state level … that is just not the way that the government is supposed to work.”

Wessels would like to see more oversight and regulation in how contractors bring down tall chimneys using explosives especially since so many utility plants will be demolished in the coming years.

“If you think about the age of these chimneys being 60 70 80 90 years old … and now that we’re changing the way that electricity is being generated” Wessels said. “We’re seeing I think the beginning of what’s going to be a lot more of tall utility chimneys being brought down.”

Meanwhile Wright said he will be honest when residents ask him about what’s going on at the Beckjord site. And that means saying he doesn’t know.

“I have a duty to look out for the community and the residents” Wright said. “We just don’t have the authority or the jurisdiction to truly oversee what’s going on down there ... So far we’ve not found any agency that truly does.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dHNwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9maXJlc3RvbmUtZ3JhbmQtcHJpeC1vZi1zdC1wZXRlcnNidXJnLXRha2VzLW92ZXItZG93bnRvd24tc3RyZWV0cy82Ny0xOTA1ZmExNC01YzI5LTRjNGEtYjc3Mi1kMGQ3YjhlMDkxMTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg 2021,"The event is underway Saturday with qualifying rounds leading up to Sunday's race.

Cette découverte marque le début de l’affaire Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès le père de famille et principal suspect de ce quintuple meurtre jamais retrouvé à ce jour. Dix ans après des apprentis détectives cherchent encore des réponses.

Elle voit le jour dès le 24 avril. En 2011 seulement quelques jours après la découverte des cadavres de la famille Dupont de Ligonnès près de Nantes une page consacrée à l’enquête ouverte à tous naît sur Facebook. Aux manettes celui qui se fait appeler « Chris la Vérité ». La page nommée « Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès : Enquête et Débat » est rapidement fermée le 26 avril : « à ce moment-là je ne l’avais pas créée sous ma véritable identité et il y a dû avoir des signalements à l'époque ça ne plaisait pas trop aux internautes explique le créateur de la page. J'essayais de parler de ça sur d’autres pages plutôt consacrées à rendre hommage à la famille. Dès qu’on était un peu dans un autre registre sur le registre du questionnement de l’enquête de la discussion on était immédiatement censuré. La simple idée d’enquêter c’était hors de question ».

La génèse

Au début de l’affaire Chris la Vérité (qui tient aujourd’hui encore à garder l’anonymat) étudie à l’Université catholique de l’ouest à Angers au même endroit que Thomas une des victimes. Plusieurs lieux récurrents dans l’enquête lui sont familiers : « je suis de la région [près de Nantes] raconte-t-il. Le restaurant gastronomique où [Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès] a dîné avec Thomas l’ancien moulin c’est un endroit que je connais je suis passé plusieurs dizaines de fois devant puisque c’était sur la route pour aller chez mes parents. »

Chris la Vérité finit par créer un nouveau groupe Facebook en mai 2011 toujours accessible et actif qui réunit aujourd’hui plus de 13 200 personnes. « L’intérêt d'une page comme ça c'est qu’il y a des idées que je n’aurais pas eu seul constate-t-il. Il y a peut-être quatre ou cinq personnes qui ont eu des idées intéressantes sur les 13 000 mais en fait ce sont ces quatre-cinq personnes-là qui ont apporté des choses. »

Intrigué par l’affaire l’internaute la suit d’abord sur Twitter. « Ça commençait déjà à “stalker” à l’époque se souvient-il. Pas mal de journalistes faisaient leurs petites recherches. J'ai fait de même et personnellement j'ai trouvé des choses beaucoup plus poussées que tout ce que je pouvais lire dans la presse. » En fouinant sur des forums notamment sur « La Cité catholique » il retrouve plusieurs messages laissés par Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès sous pseudo. « Moi j’avais juste un message de XDDL qui était posté en anonyme détaille-t-il. Après il y a eu une internaute qui a eu la curiosité d’aller voir dans la liste de tous les membres de ce forum-là s’il n’y avait pas des pseudonymes qui ressemblaient à Ligonnès. Et coup de bol il y en avait un qui s’appelait “Ligo”. L’administrateur du forum a été alerté et a pu retrouver l’adresse IP et faire la concordance avec deux ou trois autres pseudonymes. Ça a aussi permis très rapidement de tomber sur un message postérieur au meurtre datant du 8 avril qu’il avait posté en anonyme avec la même adresse IP. Immédiatement il y a eu une inquisition judiciaire du parquet de Nantes pour récupérer toutes les données informatiques qui avaient été laissées sur ce forum-là par Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès. »

Le groupe Facebook enquête ainsi en ligne grâce à des témoignages de la famille et à des fuites policières sur des groupes de discussion privés. « À force de trouver des choses intéressantes ça a intéressé la police indique Chris. Bon après il y a eu des tensions. D’ailleurs à l’époque il y a des tas de choses qu’on a appris. On nous a demandé de nous taire et on s’est tus. On s’est tus pendant dix ans mais ça a quand même fini par sortir ».

« Le “Wikipédia” de l’affaire »

Enquêter en ligne n'est pas sans conséquences. Ainsi Chris la vérité a été condamné en 2016 à 1 000 euros d’amende avec sursis pour « recel de violation du secret de l’instruction » pour avoir publié en ligne des documents de l’enquête transmis par un policier. En avril 2012 d’anciennes correspondances privées entre Xavier de Ligonnès et ses proches s’étaient ainsi retrouvées en libre accès sur Facebook entraînant une plainte de la sœur du suspect. « Dès le départ j’étais pour tout rendre public pour que chacun soit au même niveau d'information parce que je savais qu’un jour ou l’autre tout sortirait » explique l’intéressé. Dès le début de l’affaire la mise en commun d’informations en ligne a permis à toutes les théories et les spéculations possibles d’être publiées et débattues ce qui n’était pas facile à gérer de l’avis du cyber-enquêteur. « Je n’étais pas du tout préparé à ça. Je ne pensais pas que ça prendrait autant d’ampleur affirme-t-il. Tout est arrivé d’un coup il y avait plein de choses à gérer j’avais 60 demandes d’interview auxquelles je n’ai pas répondu parce que je ne pouvais pas être partout. Je ne pouvais pas à la fois faire des recherches archiver des documents et modérer la page. »

Le groupe toujours actif continue d’enregistrer de nouveaux membres au gré des évènements comme après la fausse découverte de Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès en Écosse en 2019 ou la sortie des deux numéros de « Society » consacrés à l’affaire à l’été 2020. La démarche de Chris la Vérité a séduit de nombreux internautes et une dizaine d’autres groupes plus ou moins sérieux s’est créé sur Facebook. Jessica fondatrice du groupe « XAVIER DUPONT DE LIGONNÈS enquête débats & terrain » a sollicité Chris la Vérité dans ses recherches : « c’est lui qui a découvert tout ce qu’on sait en fait estime-t-elle. C’est quelqu’un qui communique facilement les informations qu’il a pour moi c’est le “Wikipedia” de l’affaire. […] J'ai tendance à le défendre parce que faire des recherches sur Internet à partir de données publiques ce n’est pas du “hacking”. À l’époque tout était déjà public il fallait juste chercher au bon endroit. » Cette conseillère en image et coiffeuse s’est prise de passion pour l’affaire après la sortie des numéros spéciaux de « Society » : « c’est à partir de ce moment-là que j’ai commencé à me pencher sur le sujet plus en profondeur déclare-t-elle. […] J’ai toujours aimé ce genre d’enquêtes depuis toute petite. Un mois avant le Covid je m’étais renseignée pour passer le concours de détective privé. Mon grand-père était un espion de l’armée... C’est quelque chose qui fait partie de moi. »

« Tout le monde apporte sa pierre à l’édifice »

« Je crois en l’intelligence collective je trouve ça dommage qu’on ne fasse pas plus appel à des bénévoles » regrette Jessica. Après avoir fait le tour des groupes Facebook déjà existants lassée des questions redondantes et des théories complotistes elle créé le sien en septembre 2020. Il compte 48 membres et les conditions d’accès sont moins aisées que pour celui de Chris la Vérité. Ainsi une série de questions précises sur l'affaire sont soumises à l’internaute souhaitant adhérer au groupe. « Nous sommes un petit comité mais tout le monde connaît bien l'affaire tout le monde apporte sa pierre à l’édifice mentionne Jessica. Quand on a monté notre groupe chacun avait sa mission. Nous avons beaucoup de dossiers et de sous-dossiers : on va avoir tous les membres de la famille les trajets... Tout est bien cadré. […] Dès qu’il y a une info qui sort c’est sûr qu’on est sur le coup. Mais on n’attend pas qu’une information sorte pour faire des recherches. » La jeune femme insiste sur le fait qu’il faut « se poser des limites ».

« Au début je ne le cache pas c’était des nuits des soirées entières à chercher des détails des noms à tomber sur les blogs des enfants... Donc oui ça prend aux tripes reconnaît-elle. […] Ça peut devenir une obsession. J’avais beaucoup communiqué avec le frère d’Agnès [épouse de Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès retrouvée morte avec ses quatre enfants ndlr] qui est un monsieur adorable. Je trouvais qu’il se faisait beaucoup attaquer sur les réseaux sociaux. Je voyais que les gens étaient trop intrusifs dans sa vie privée ils allaient beaucoup trop loin c’est quelque chose qui m’a beaucoup dérangée. C’est une affaire publique du coup on a l’impression que ça nous donne tous les droits mais ce n’est pas vrai. »

Les autres membres de ce groupe « select » eux aussi fascinés par l’affaire viennent de divers horizons : Laura auxiliaire de crèche dit regarder « beaucoup d’émissions comme “Faites entrer l’accusé” “Crimes”... ». Matthieu graphiste préfère quant à lui les polars. « Ce sont plutôt les révélations de l'enquête qui m'intéressent le fait de creuser dans le quotidien d’un individu explique-t-il. Je ne cours pas après les affaires sordides. » C’est le documentaire « Don’t f**k with cats » produit par Netflix « où on voit un peu comment un groupe Facebook se met à traquer un tueur en série [Luka Rocco Magnotta criminel canadien connu pour avoir été le premier meurtrier à publier ses crimes en vidéo ndlr] qui se retrouve lui-même en danger » qui l’a poussé à faire des recherches actives sur l’affaire Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès. Sur la cavale du père de famille chacun a ses théories également. C’est ce qui tient en haleine ces enquêteurs amateurs. Tous se concentrent sur des zones d’ombre des angles morts qui pourraient faire avancer l’affaire et peut-être parvenir à un dénouement. Ainsi pour Laura « s’il est vivant c’est vrai qu’il doit répondre de ses actes pour qu’Agnès et ses enfants puissent reposer en paix réellement ».",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2FjdHUuZnIvb2NjaXRhbmllL3RvdWxvdXNlXzMxNTU1L3RvcC0xNC1wZXNxdWV0LWNvZGUtZ3RhLWFudG9pbmUtZHVwb250LWFmZm9sZS1sZXMtcmVzZWF1eC1hcHJlcy1zb24tZW5vcm1lLXByZXN0YXRpb25fNDEzMzAwMDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Top 14.

LONGVIEW Texas — Time has brought a 117-year-old iron railroad bridge over the Sabine River to the end of the line.

BNSF Railway owns the track whose path takes it through Rusk Harrison and Gregg counties passing through the industrial area that includes Eastman Chemical Co. The iron truss railroad bridge that spans the Sabine River at the Harrison and Gregg counties line was constructed in 1904 a BNSF spokesman reported.

“The bridges over the Sabine River are part of our heavy bridge program which addresses the replacement of larger bridges on the BNSF network” said company spokesman Ben Wilemon. “The new bridges (will) feature modern designs that allow our customers the flexibility to ship heavy axle loads something which the previous designs from 1904 prevented.”

Little else is known about the bridge’s history except that it was built by one of the predecessors of the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railway which BNSF described as one of its “major predecessors.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZW5kLW9mLXRoZS1saW5lLXJhaWxyb2FkLWNvbXBhbnktdG8tcmVwbGFjZS0xMTcteWVhci1vbGQtaXJvbi1icmlkZ2Utb3Zlci1zYWJpbmUvYXJ0aWNsZV8yZGQyMWFiOC05YzgwLTExZWItYjQ5MS1hNzE2NDM4ZDBhY2IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of the line: Railroad company to replace 117-year-old iron bridge over Sabine River,Jo Lee Ferguson wishes she kept her maiden name - Hammer - because it was perfect for a reporter.

It has been greatly expanded during the past five decades and though the original sections of the mall survive they are almost unrecognizable.

The story of Yorkdale is a vital part of the history of retailing in the Toronto area. It was Canada's first indoor mall an improvement for shoppers that particularly suited the Canadian climate. It allowed people to park walk inside an enclosed structure and access shops from its interior.

Yorkdale was built in an era when many suburbanites shopped at ""strip malls"" constructed to accommodate those living in communities surrounding the city that owned cars.

The first strip mall in the Toronto area was at Bayview and Eglinton. Many such malls still exist today consisting of shops built in one or more rows their front doors facing an outdoor parking lot. Customers enter the stores directly from the parking lots.

Strip malls began appearing after the Second World War when many Torontonians were relocating from the city’s urban core to the suburbs.

They were following a dream of owning larger homes on more generous-size building lots. Some of the houses they left behind in the inner city were purchased or rented by the immigrants arriving in the city.

Relocating to the suburbs was facilitated by the post-war's booming economy which placed automobile prices within the reach of more and more Canadians.

Vehicle sales skyrocketed creating the beginning of a ""car-dominated society."" It allowed people to travel greater distances to shop or attend a movie.

Eaton's was one of the first to realize the potential of meeting the needs of the increasing number of suburbanites.

Prior to the Second World War the company's department stores were in the downtown core. Aware of the expansion in population in the suburbs in 1954 for the price $1.4 million Eaton's bought 100 acres of land located to the northwest of the city. The intent was to erect a large shopping mall on the site.

Eaton's knew that it needed another major retailer to join in the venture. As a result in 1961 the company offered to sell the Robert Simpson Company one half of the site if it joined in the enterprise.

However Simpsons wanted only 19 acres on the west side of the property and stipulated that the price must include sewage water connections and roadways. Eaton's agreed and spent $1 million to satisfy the terms of the deal.

The land where Yorkdale was to be erected was cleared and ready for construction by the spring of 1962 the work commencing during the early-summer of that year.

Everything was completed by February 1964. As opening day drew near John David Eaton insisted that the mall close at 5:30 or 6 p.m. similar to its downtown stores.

However the smaller retailers in the project strongly objected since they wanted to remain open until 9:30 p.m.. John David finally agreed after he was assured that employees would not be required to work longer hours than they wanted.

On Sunday February 16 1964 long lines of customers gathered at the various entrances to Yorkdale waiting for the 9:30 a.m. opening. By mid-morning its four parking lots (6500 spaces) were completely filled.

At 2:30 p.m. drivers were scouring the lots trying to find a place to park. By the end of the day the Star newspaper estimated that 100000 shoppers had crammed into the mall.

Yorkdale had over 1.2 million square feet of space containing 61 retail shops several restaurants and multiple services.

The Dominion (today their stores are named Metro) was the largest the company had ever built containing 17 checkout counters.

The week the plaza opened some of the shops were not yet occupied but it was still an impressive sight. For a short period of time Yorkdale was the largest indoor shopping mall in the world. Though its size was impressive its importance was perhaps due to another factor.

Yorkdale set the pattern for future malls across Canada. It demonstrated the advantages of locating malls near transportation hubs which allowed shoppers access from nearby arterial roadways.

As well it showed that if retail enterprises of this size were to be successful more than one large-scale store was required. Yorkdale actually possessed three—Simpsons on its west side Eaton's on its east and a Dominion Store on the south.

It was the first time that Canada's two largest department store chains—Eaton's and Simpsons—were under one roof. This was accomplished even though they had been competitors across Canada for many decades.

Prior to the opening of Yorkdale many people living in the suburbs had continued to shop downtown or visited local strip malls. Neither of these options was truly convenient.

When suburbanites drove downtown even then parking was becoming a nightmare. Strip malls were also at a disadvantage as they were exposed to the vagaries of the Canadian weather.

The appeal of Yorkdale was obvious. It offered numerous retail outlets that were closer to home than the downtown were impervious to the weather and possessed plenteous free parking.

Torontonians were able to drive to the mall to shop indoors enjoy a meal or snack and attend a movie theatre all at one destination.

The configuration of the Yorkdale Plaza was basically an ""L-shape."" The top of the ""L"" the bottom and elbow of the ""L"" were anchored by one of the large stores.

The corridors that connected the big stores resembled indoor shopping streets one-third of a mile long 40 feet wide the ceiling above them two storeys in height.

The three large retailers had large open spaces in front of them similar to a courtyard or piazza which were three-storeys high.

Since the mall was climate controlled shoppers were able to enjoy strolling along the wide avenue-like areas and courtyards in comfort immune to the weather outside.

The curtains in the spacious windows located high above the shops could be automatically adjusted to allow the proper amount of light to enter the interior of the plaza.

Other pleasing features were the two large fountains as well as numerous 20-foot trees some of them palm trees.

In 1964 Yorkdale had many popular stores — Reitman's Collyer Shoes Peoples Credit Jewellers Laura Secord Candies Hunts Bakery Jordan Wines Henry Birks and Sons Jewellers Jack Frasers Men's and Boy's Wear Toy World Kresge's and Eddie Black's Camera Store.

I vividly remember Coleman's Delicatessen and its delicious corned beef sandwiches the restaurant located near the Dominion Store.

There was a Smitty's Pancake House which also served small steaks (the site later became ""Obies""). The Encore Noshery was reputed to be the largest restaurant in Canada in a shopping centre.

The beauty parlour ""Ponytails"" which catered to the needs of small children had hobbyhorses instead of regular chairs.

Yorkdale had a cinema with two auditoriums with combined seating for 1200 patrons. I remember seeing Mel Brook's zany film Blazing Saddles at the Yorkdale Cinema in 1974.

It was an afternoon matinee attended mostly by seniors. I was one of the few persons in the audience that did not have purple-tinted hair. As a matter of fact even then I did not have much hair at all.

As the screening progressed I discovered that I was also one of the few that was laughing. I admit that the humour was a little off-colour— typically Mel Brooks.

Eaton's and Simpsons both had restaurants. The Simpson's Court restaurant overlooked the cathedral-like interior courtyard with its three-storey ceiling.

I remember visiting it numerous times for lunch usually ordering the daily special of soup chicken-pot pie and a salad.

Eaton's Vista restaurant was on the second floor at the northwest corner of the store overlooking the mall where there was a fountain. In the evenings the Vista featured all-you-can-eat buffet which included roast beef.

I sometimes visited it on a Friday for dinner. I seem to remember that Eaton's restaurant was later renamed ""The Loft"" but I cannot find any proof of this. Memory sometimes plays strange tricks.

Though Yorkdale was located quite a distance north of the downtown it was connected by several arterial roadways—Highway 401 Wilson Avenue and Dufferin Street.

Market research conducted by Eaton's had shown that the mall was likely to attract shoppers from within a 30-minute drive. This meant that people as far away as Brampton and Whitby could easily drive to Yorkdale as well as those living north of Bloor Street.

This was a potential market of almost a million shoppers. In 1966 the location became even more advantageous when the interchange at the Allen Expressway and the 401 was completed and in January 1978 when the mall was connected to the University/Yonge subway line.

The architect of the Yorkdale Mall and the Eaton's Store was John Graham Consultants. The store Graham created for Eaton's had a striking exterior with off-white bricks containing three-dimensional patterns that accented the vertical elements of the design.

Another added feature of the plaza was the underground truck tunnel that delivered goods to the retail outlets. The gigantic Dominion Store featured an underground conveyor belt that delivered customers' purchases to a station in the south-west parking lot where they could pick up their groceries.

John B. Parkin Associates were hired to design the Simpsons store the architect within the firm who was assigned the work being John Andrews a Harvard-educated Australian.

During the years ahead Andrews opened his own firm and won the contracts for the University of Toronto's Scarborough Campus and the CN Tower.

I recall attending Boxing Day sales at Yorkdale during the 1970s; I visited early in the morning to avoid the enormous crowds even though compared to today they were considerably smaller.

Yorkdale was where I first experienced the frustration of losing my automobile in a parking lot. I soon learned to memorize the row or section number where it was located.

During the 1980s I visited the mall to attend the Yorkdale Antique Market. It was usually held each February and continued consecutively for three or four years.

It was a large display which fully occupied all of the ""L""-shaped space. The mall also held fashion and automobile shows.

On frigid winter days for exercise I drove to the mall in the early morning to walk within the enclosed area. When the shops opened I enjoyed a coffee and then drove home.

In 1984 Yorkdale was expanded by an additional 153000 square feet with 75 new stores at a cost of $14 million.

In 1991 Sears Department store opened in the plaza. In 1999 the Rainforest Cafe began serving food in a tropical atmosphere (it closed in 2014).

In 2012 an addition was erected on the southwest side of Yorkdale. It included a relocated and expanded Holt Renfrew Store situated where the Dominion store had been.

In 2015 the Sears Store on the west side of the plaza was demolished and replaced with the 70000 square-foot Restoration Hardware which opened in 2017. It resembled an impressive mansion with indoor and outdoor shops a courtyard cafe and rooftop conservatory/park.

In 2016 another section was built on the east side with a Nordtrom Department Store Uniqlo as well as 30 more retailers.

In 2017 the The Cheesecake Factory restaurant commenced operation. More expansions have continued since.

Visiting Yorkdale in recent times I lament the loss of the fountains and the large trees particularly the palm trees. However I thought that the massive skylights in the ceilings of the new sections were amazing.

Creative in design they allow plenteous daylight to enter the interior walking areas. In some instances I felt I was strolling up the nave of a great cathedral.

You'd think that demand for a gaming system that dropped last November would have waned by now but high demand exacerbated by low supply caused by a global chip shortage has continued to make it difficult for Sony to produce enough consoles for everyone who wants one.

But don't lose hope! Sony's PlayStation Direct has been holding brief restock events almost weekly and those who continue to queue up for a PS5 might also have a chance to get an email to get into the front of the line. GameStop also continues to receive bundles. And if you're not already on Twitter keeping an eye out for inventory drops at the major retailers you should be: They're happening more and more often.

If you're willing to shell out way more than the sticker price you can get a PlayStation 5 or PS5 bundle at a reseller like eBay or StockX. But our advice is to wait until the console is available at its regular sticker price at retailers like Best Buy Amazon GameStop Target and Walmart. Be sure to check back here often for the latest updates on when retailers might have new console restocks.

Don't give up trying to get one of these. Sony

You can monitor PlayStation 5 stock updates on your own; as mentioned above Twitter is a good source for restock rumors. But we occasionally get word directly from retailers and tipsters about upcoming PS5 console inventory restocks and we update this post immediately. Again be aware: It likely could be months before anything approximating normal inventory levels appears in stores so getting your own PS5 gaming console is likely to be a challenge until summer at the earliest. Below you'll find a list of all the major retailers (and a few high-profile resellers) where you can monitor the video game console's stock and availability.

Amazon You can check out Amazon's page for the $400 Digital Edition via the button below or if you'd rather get in line for the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500. See at Amazon

Newegg Newegg doesn't sell PS5 consoles by themselves just bundles. Still it does have regular restocks for those who don't mind spending a little extra. See at Newegg

eBay We don't recommend spending more than retail to get a PS5 but if you must have a console right now eBay is your shortcut to getting a console. That said expect to pay hundreds over list; the average PS5 price on eBay is about $800. See at eBay

StockX If you've exhausted all of the usual retail options and you're willing to pay hundreds over list price you might want to check out StockX an eBay alternative that made its name in the secondary market for sneakers and designer clothing. Last time we checked prices for the PS5 were hovering just below $650. We don't think it's worth it but let your conscience (and your wallet) be your guide. See at StockX

Lance Corporal Adam Tonkin 32 repeatedly raided cupboards in the Army stores facility where he worked and stole hi-tech military gear to sell online via his girlfriend's eBay account.

LCpl Tonkin of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards told his partner that he could 'sell lots of Army stuff and make loads of money' to fund his gambling addiction.

Over the course of a three month period while working in the quartermaster stores of Vimy Barracks Catterick Garrison North Yorkshire he stole £26617 worth of equipment.

Bulford Military Court (pictured) heard that the 32-year-old stole more than £26000 of military equipment over the course of three months at Vimy Barracks in 2018

Among the items taken were 60 Virtus military helmets which were described as 'attractive to criminal and terrorist organisations' by prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel David Cotton.

He also admitted taking 70 pairs of military boots seven padlocks 23 Virtus hydration packs two sleeping bags 13 thermal smocks 52 pairs of waterproof socks 35 black deployment holdalls and 10 backpacks.

LCpl Tonkin who served for eight years in the Army admitted nine charges of theft and has been dismissed from the military.

Prosecuting at Bulford Military Court Lt Col David Cotton said: 'Police recovered WhatsApp messages between him and his girlfriend telling her he can sell lots of Army stuff and make loads of money'.

'The helmets are the latest generation available to service personnel and considered as being attractive to criminal and other undesirable elements. That's why there's a particular interest in items like this in particular from criminal and terrorist organisations.

'The sale of these to persons unknown leaves open a very real possibility that British service personnel could face those equipped with these or police forces responding to incidents of a terror nature.'

LCpl Tonki admitted taking military boots padlocks hydration packs sleeping bags thermal smocks waterproof socks deployment holdalls and backpacks at Bulford Military Court

LCpl Tonkin told the court he was a 'completely different person' when the thefts took place and added that he hasn't 'gambled since May 2019' and is in 'a much better place now than [he was] in 2018 when all this took place.'

Never disregard places like eBay

This may seem obvious but I’m always surprised when someone has spent hundreds of pounds on a new piece of furniture that looks like an exact double of a vintage piece. Don’t get me wrong – you can get burnt shopping for vintage online. My eye for detail is a little blurry and I have been known to accidentally buy dolls house furniture on occasion. But if you’re a bit more on the ball than myself you can come away with some real bargains. My favourite three pieces in my flat are all from eBay and not one cost over £100 (and the dolls house furniture looks divine next to them).

2). If you’re feeling unsure about your knowledge don’t worry about it

Furniture has a great and varied history and no one is expecting you to know everything. Besides learning is half of the fun. I have a real love for programmes like Salvage Hunters with Drew Pritchard which is an excellent way to train your eye and get a little foundational knowledge before beginning your shopping journey.

3). Invest in old magazines and design books

I have recently started buying back issues of World of Interiors House & Garden and Architectural Digest. If you’re looking at a house that was featured 40 years ago and the style still appeals to you that gives you an idea of which pieces are worth investing in. Also it can help you see how trends will date which brings me to my next point…

4). Please don’t feel pressured to buy into trends

I am a big fan of tat; in fact I love it. But we all have to be realistic about how much of it we need in our lives when it comes to furniture. It’s not like buying a vintage top that can be sneakily slid between two others. It is going to take up space and make itself known. You want harmony in your household not headaches. My method to help me see the wood from the trees is to continually document the things I love (whether by screen-shotting or taking pictures) and revisiting them in the coming weeks. If you still love something a few months on go forth and purchase!

5). Be prepared to get up really early

International Antiques & Collectors Fairs take place countrywide and they are a hive of activity. If you think you’ve woken up early to get there someone will have certainly gotten up earlier and travelled further. Apart from anything they are tremendous fun but do remember to go with a list of what you actually need and bring a tape measure. The frustration of moving that perfect chest of drawers into your room and never closing the door again is just not worth the risk.

6). Follow antique dealers even if they’re not your style or out of your price range

Their styling and wealth of knowledge are essential. I have fallen in love with many a piece that I don’t have a hope in hell of being able to buy but that piece will set off an idea and give me a picture that I can keep in my mind until I find something that comes close. Case in point: a Frits Henningsen sofa that I was introduced to by Get The Gusto a long time ago; I could never have afforded it but it did help me realise what I admire in a sofa.

Below some of the dealers that I find most inspiring to follow on Instagram now…

Mum buys 'wall-sized' feather decorations on eBay and is stunned at what turns up

When a house proud mum spotted some wall-sized feather decorations for sale on eBay she fell in love.

Lolly a property manager and DJ from Ruislip north west London excitedly ordered them deciding they'd be ideal for her hallway and would lead up the stairs.

The image of the £12.99 decorations on the eBay listing showed they were large mirrored-effect decorations which would add the illusion of more space in any home.

A few weeks later when a small A5 grey plastic envelope arrived at Lolly's home she had no idea what it contained.

The only order she was waiting for were the large wall coverings for her home but it surely couldn't be them as the package was far too small.

Lolly was wrong.

She told the Mirror: ""I' was wondering what was in the envelope and when I opened it out dropped eight tiny grey shapes.

""I realised they were supposed to be the wall coverings and I could do nothing but laugh.""

Instead of the large mirrored feathers she had been promised Lolly received miniature feather-shaped bits of grey plastic.

In addition the items were sent from China and not from the UK as the Ebay listing said hence the long wait which ended in disappointment albeit one with a funny side.

""To think I wait so long for my order and this is what I got.

""Some people would be upset but with everything we have been through it was nice to have a laugh.""

Lolly said she won't be pursuing the seller for a refund even though her purchase was not clearly described.

She explained: ""The laugh it gave me and my friends was worth the £12.99.

""When I put it on my Facebook page I took pictures of it next to a computer mouse and a TV remote so people can see just how small they are and the amount of laughter it caused makes it worth every penny.""

""I think the next time I want something from my home I'll go to the shops"" she laughed.

""At least then I know exactly what I'm buying!""."

Presented by Oculus Studios and Electronic Arts’ Respawn Entertainment and later acquired and distributed by The Guardian it’s the first time a video game industry project has won an Oscar.

Directed by Anthony Giacchino Colette features a French Resistance survivor Colette Marin-Catherine returning to Germany for the first time since the end of World War II to visit a slave labor camp where her brother was killed. The documentary is presented in a traditional 2D format whether you watch it in the Oculus TV app or elsewhere.

“The real hero here is Colette herself.”

“The real hero here is Colette herself who has shared her story with integrity and strength” Oculus Studios director of production Mike Doran says in a statement. “As we see in the film resistance takes courage but facing one’s past may take even more. Allowing us to preserve this pilgrimage for future generations was a true act of bravery and trust. We hope this award and the film’s reach means as Colette says that Jean-Pierre’s memory as well as all of those who resisted are no longer lost in the ‘Night and Fog’ of Dora.”

“It’s true what they say: It really is an honor just to be nominated. And it’s an incredible moment to win. We’re humbled by this recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and would like to extend our sincere congratulations to all of our fellow nominees. It’s a privilege to stand alongside you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoL2dhbWluZy8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L29zY2FyLTIwMjEtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZS1zaG9ydC13d2lpLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5LWFjYWRlbXktYXdhcmQvNzM1NDc1NzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oscars 2021: Video game's short WWII documentary up for Academy Award,"This year's Oscar hopefuls include some names you might not expect among the nominees: Respawn Entertainment and Oculus Studios.

No the publisher of video games ""Titanfall"" and ""Apex Legends"" and Facebook's virtual reality studio are not nominated for best visual effects. ""Colette"" a short film the companies co-produced along with the U.K. media outlet The Guardian is nominated for best short documentary at the Academy Awards being doled out Sunday.

The 25-minute film tells the story of Colette Marin-Catherine 92 who was part of the French resistance during World War II. Along with French history student Lucie Fouble she visits the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in Germany where her brother Jean-Pierre had died in 1945 three weeks before allied troops freed prisoners there.

""The idea that a gaming company partners with a news organization to release this – is a first"" the film's writer and director Anthony Giacchino told The Hollywood Reporter. ""That's never happened before [and] it's pretty amazing to me.""

The ""Medal of Honor"" franchise which Electronic Arts launched in 1999 has some strong ties to film. The PlayStation game was inspired by Steven Spielberg's film ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Spielberg helped craft the story.

Spielberg ""had the foresight 20 years ago to know that video games would be the dominant form of entertainment and that that (would be) how the majority of young people would be learning"" Peter Hirschmann who directed the recent VR game for Respawn and produced the original told The Hollywood Reporter.

According to the new announcement a total of 13 new games support FPS Boost which includes 12 titles that will be boosted to run at 120fps and one that can go up to 60fps. The feature clearly highlights the superior performance that the new generation Microsoft console offers above what the Xbox One was capable of although to make the most of the higher frame rates users may need to tone down graphics settings from ultra to high – in isolated cases.

The list of new games that now support 120fps on the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles include Battlefield 4 Titanfall Star Wars: Battlefront Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare Battlefield 1 Titanfall 2 Star Wars: Battlefront 2 Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 Battlefield 5 Mirror’s Edge Catalyst Unravel Two and Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville. The solitary new game that has been cleared for 60fps gameplay with FPS Boost includes Sea of Solitude. The list now joins 10 previous games that had already received FPS Boost support earlier which include: Dishonored – Definitive Edition Fallout 4 Fallout 76 Prey The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition Far Cry 4 New Super Lucky’s Tale Sniper Elite 4 UFC 4 and Watch Dogs 2.

To enable FPS Boost on your new Xbox Series X and Series S consoles pause a game by tapping on the Xbox button on your controller. Subsequently scroll down to the active game tap on the additional menu button on the controller and scroll down to ‘manage game and add-ons’. From here scroll down to select the ‘compatibility options’ feature and tap on the FPS Boost field to check the box beside it. Games which support the feature will have the option in this page alongside Auto HDR – a feature that’s also geared to improve the overall quality of gameplay on the console. A subsequent restart of the game will be required after enabling FPS Boost.

Unfortunately casual gamers will note that the Xbox Series X ecosystem has still not enabled FPS Boost for two of EA’s most popular franchises of all time – Need for Speed and FIFA. While not being the most resource intensive FPS Boost can help the latter titles offer a smoother gameplay experience but any presence of this in the newest (or older) versions of these titles remain a pipe dream for fans. Nevertheless the new update does cover a whole bunch of popular games which can also be accessed via subscriptions such as EA Play or the all-inclusive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

‘why not?’ at massimo de carlo hong kong invites the viewer to a joyful positive exhibition where paola pivi’s universe unfolds. among the works on view are two hanging sculptures ‘lightening ball’ and ‘my little ball’ which are constructed by the entire current vitra collection of miniature chairs. when lit the sculptures which double as lamps project mesmerizing shadows the silhouettes of the chairs all over the walls allowing the viewer to experience the history of design from an unexpected perspective. the last artwork displayed is ‘I don’t need a title’ from 2008 a wall sculpture made of thousands of plexiglas pearls in different colors inspired by joseph albers. the work is part of the artist’s series made with pearls and it is characterized by a concentric and geometric design.

designboom spoke with paola pivi to learn more about the artworks on display the ephemeral nature of art made of feathers as well as how the ongoing pandemic has affected her view of the world. read the interview in full below.

designboom (DB): is there a common thread that underpins the works of ‘why not’?

paola pivi (PP): it looks to me they are artworks with a positive fun attitude to life very approachable as well. human size in these times of human hardship.

DB: ‘bear foot’ the new body of work on display marks the most recent development in your colorful feathered polar bear series. why did you decide to focus on the bear’s feet this time?

sculptural fetishist funny and fun ticklish colorful rainbow-y. art made of feathers is already conceptual art by its matter because it is ephemeral.

DB: among the new works on view are the two hanging sculptures composed of miniatures chairs by vitra that cast immersive shadows when lit. what are these ‘universes’?

PP: they are sculptures as well as lamps. let’s play with our life. I like the burden/weight of many chairs on the thin hand-made aluminum fragile frame underneath. I like the puzzle made by composing together the chairs’ feet/legs/extremities when they match and when they do not.

DB: where did your fascination with chair design come from?

PP: vitra miniatures sparked it. I also like designer furniture very much. since we need these items in our homes why not have the extra research in them?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1tYWluc3RyZWFtLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We’re All Crypto People Now,"SAN FRANCISCO — On Monday evening a few days after a large cryptocurrency exchange listed its shares on the stock market several hundred women gathered in a virtual conference room to talk about Bitcoin. Claire Wasserman a co-founder of Ladies Get Paid the company that co-hosted the event marveled at the turnout noting it showed “how committed you all are to getting wealthy.” She described a sweeping change in the way we live work and transact — all driven by crypto. “I don’t want you to miss out on the future” she said.

Attendees lit up the comments section to talk digital currency. One woman said she started investing after posing as a man in online forums for pickup artists.

“It was very YUCK” she wrote “but I learned a lot.”

Another said she’d been funneling her shopping budget into crypto during the pandemic doubling her money since November.

A panel of talking heads encouraged the women to buy and hold Bitcoin as an investment — even just $5 or $25. They offered advice on security privacy taxes and digital wallets. And they pitched crypto start-ups as places to find promising career opportunities that could frankly use more women."

Ross has won medals in the 2012 London Olympics and the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Olympics. As she prepares to compete to qualify for the Tokyo Games she channels her mother’s determination.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. However the American Cancer Society reports that there are more than 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.

By Chris Woodyard

When beach volleyball champion April Ross scores a critical point or makes a tough play she will tap her chest and point to the sky. ""That's just a nod to my mom 'thank you for helping us get this point' acknowledging she's still with me and inspiring me"" Ross said. Ross was a 19-year-old college sophomore when she lost her mother Margie Ross to metastatic breast cancer. Today as a 38-year-old two-time Olympic medal winner Ross draws strength from memory of her mother's selflessness in helping her daughters achieve while coping with her illness.

""Reflecting back on her life I can appreciate how strong she was and how brave she was in the face of everything she was dealing with"" Ross said an interview from a training camp in Mexico. ""I look back on that and have so much inspiration in her courage and I just try to channel that on the court and in life.""

Ross stands 6-foot 1-inch a natural gift that she also attributes to her mother who was only an inch shorter. She joined the volleyball team while attending high school in Newport Beach California and went on to the University of Southern California on an indoor volleyball scholarship.

Her mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer when Ross was in elementary school. She persevered for a decade through treatments as she continued to drive Ross and her younger sister to athletic practices and competitions. She offered support during the emotional trauma of the occasional poor performance.

Though Margie had to visit the hospital often enough that she knew the nurses by name it was a rare day that she was too ill to pack the kids' lunches. She was ""really the backbone of our support system which is such a selfless thing to do especially dealing with breast cancer at the time"" Ross said.

The family was close. Ross said her dad had played basketball and wrestled in his younger days. Though Ross' mom wasn't terribly athletic herself she adored being outdoors in nature whether it was leading her daughters on biking trips through Newport Beach's swampy back bay or roughing it in tents or rafts during camping trips to Yosemite National Park.

Ross was sent reeling when her mother died. She said her grades plummeted and team performance suffered. At the end of USC's winter break she rallied. She said she recommitted to improving her grades taking better care of herself and focusing on volleyball. The team went on to win two back-to-back national championships.

After college Ross went on tp professional team volleyball but discovered that beach volleyball was more to her liking. ""I loved the culture. I loved the game. I loved the independence it gave the players"" she said. ""You kind of got the chance to determine your own destiny""

That attraction led to an Olympic silver medal in the London games in 2012 and bronze in the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016. Now she and beach volleyball partner Alix Klineman are going for the gold training in hopes of officially qualifying to compete at the Tokyo games.

As an Olympian Ross and the story of her mother attracted Eli Lilly and Company as a sponsor. Lilly is partner of Team USA and U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams and has been identifying athletes like Ross ""who we thought would be great to work with to help advance a greater dialogue about the importance of health"" said Lilly spokeswoman Courtney Kasinger.

The American Cancer Society estimates that about 43600 women will die from breast cancer in 2021.

The sponsorship means Ross is again having to face the grief that came with profound loss something she says she couldn't have done soon after mother's death. It's easier now that time has passed and with the hope she inspires others with memories of her mother.

Despite her mother being gone Ross still has her family fan club. Ross' dad and her sister all three live within about a mile of each other cheer her on. But she misses mom.

""It's heartbreaking for me that she wasn't able to see me compete at the Olympics"" Ross said.

What is Metastatic Breast Cancer?

Metastatic breast cancer (also called “stage four” breast cancer) means that the cancer has spread or metastasized beyond the breasts and to other parts of the body. Currently there is no cure for metastatic breast cancer. But there are a variety of treatment options used to battle this disease including: hormone therapy chemotherapy targeted drugs immunotherapy and a combination of various treatments.

Dr. Elizabeth Comen an oncologist with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center explained in a previous interview ""With advanced disease the goal of treatment is to keep you as stable as possible slow the tumor growth and improve your quality of life.""

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. However the American Cancer Society reports that there are more than 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.

Sooner or later modules connectors and inverters will experience some form of trouble as would be the case for any other technical appliance. What makes solar arrays unique in this respect is that they require little attention from human operators. Once installed at a sunny location operators watch over performance metrics from afar with engineering crews visiting the site periodically. That makes things easy but also brings the question of failure detection to the fore. Module-level power electronics (MLPE) offer visibility of anomalies in unmatched granularity – a strong value proposition one would think. Still despite MLPE suppliers having increased their market share in the C&I and to some degree in the ground-mounted segment the industry remains wary of the devices’ cost and use.

“MLPE can give you a first good indicative data point” explains Jenya Meybray CEO of PV Evolution Labs. “But not all of them can. It is important to distinguish between power optimizers microinverters string combiners and rapid shutdown devices for example.” Meydbray further explains that anything performance-related can be picked up by module-level power electronics better than by string-level monitoring. On top of that the essential differences in a device’s ability to detect faults is dependent on the availability of distributed maximum power point tracking (see table right).

To detect faults at string level the inverter will measure the string voltage and current and compare it to a reference point. That is usually a neighboring parallel string or a performance assumption made with temperature and irradiance sensors. An MLPE device with MPPT function does the same but on module level comparing two modules next to each other. This presents a decisive advantage because string voltage adds up from module to module and the current is adjusted for all the modules in a string. That makes it near impossible to detect outliers within a string.

“In the case of yellowing of the encapsulant for example a power optimizer would be able to detect that the current drops but the voltage stays the same for a module because of the reduced irradiation on the cell” explains Meydbray. “String level monitoring would be less granular and it is more likely that some of these faults are hidden behind the ‘noise’ in the string.”

Another example of faults that can be well detected using MLPE is potential induced degradation (PID). This failure mode caused by leakage currents between the semiconductor and frame and mounting structure leads to sodium-ions attacking the passivation layer – sometimes irreversibly. Because PID is caused by a potential between the semiconductor and the structure the problem is more pronounced in modules that are physically closer to the positive pole of a string.

Inverter manufacturer SolarEdge Technologies is known for its use of DC power optimizers and advertises that its system can detect PID. Microinverters like Enphase solutions on the other hand would eliminate the problem because each module has its own inverter and thus runs on a low voltage and therefore a low potential to its surroundings. With power point tracking MLPE it would be easy to identify such a pattern because an operator can see how each module performs.

In contrast string-level monitoring can only tell that a string is down on power. If parallel strings are somewhat equally affected it would be tough to spot the problem. That is especially true if the performance loss is marginal – though that does not mean that the financial damage this incurs would be marginal.

In February energy consultancy DNV GL published a paper on predictive maintenance in the solar industry. Here the consultants made a calculation asserting that for a 100 MW site exposed to 2500 hours of irradiance per year and financed through a €35/MWh PPA a performance loss of a mere 1.6% would incur financial losses to the tune of €140000 per year. The argument that MLPE proves its economic case if it is cheaper than the damage to equip a 100 MW site with monitoring MLPE seems apparent but it may not be complete.

DNV GL focused its analysis on inverter-related failures and in recent years these have been the dominant failure point in solar arrays. Though the example still shows the considerable financial impacts of what seem to be marginal losses it also demonstrates the industry’s hesitation to adopt MLPE. Adding power electronics to each module drastically increases the number of potential failure points. But this problem is not unique to MLPE.

“I have been told by a project developer in California that the failure rate for their monitoring systems was 100%” Meydbray recalls. “At some point sooner or later they all experience some downtime.” Similarly a faulty monitoring system would cause a truck roll and if the asset operator is unlucky a lengthy troubleshooting process.

Of course on top of that financial consideration it only works if MLPE can find any failure in a solar plant. And even if it was possible to identify performance issues the data that MLPE usually produces won’t stand should there be a dispute over warranty claims – the modules in question would still need to go to a testing lab.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Enterprises are striving for better infrastructure management that will deliver flexibility IT operations efficiency and ability to maximise reach.

Enterprises are building their digital roadmap with a hybrid multi-cloud model comprising of – private cloud multiple public clouds and third party colocation. Regardless of the architecture—there are two crucial considerations for a hybrid setup. One is a highly reliable data center offering 99.999% uptime under 24x7 supervision of experts; and second is secure high-speed low latency network connectivity. In the outsourcing proposition the network component is extremely critical as it ‘glues’ together the various aspects of enterprises’ IT architecture.

The emergence of Hyperconnected Edge data centers with multiple Cloud Service Providers and Cloud Exchange along with large congregation of Telcos ISPs and multiple Internet Exchanges is crucial for enterprises’ digital transformation. The fundamental purpose of an ‘Edge Data Center’ is to provide connectivity-rich vendor neutral and open Interconnection Ecosystem not only connecting businesses to cloud providers but also to their remote workforce customers partners and ecosystems like financial institutes and stock exchanges among others.

GPX - Carrier Neutral DC and an Interconnection Leader

GPX India is a Tier-IV Edge Data Center Campus offering colocation services and an interconnection ecosystem with multiple network partners Edge PoPs of over 8 major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and India’s first ‘Open Cloud Exchange’.

It has been recognised as one of the Top 10 Hyperconnected Enterprise Networking Hubs by Telegeography. Other global data center operators named in this list include Equinix Coresite TELEHOUSE and SUNeVision.

Enterprises can leverage a highly Interconnected Edge DC

The presence of AWS Direct Connect Google Dedicated Interconnect and Oracle FastConnect within the GPX data center enables dedicated private connectivity to cloud over a LAN fibre cable bypassing the public Internet.

GPX hosts 12 Carriers and 170+ ISPs thus providing a rich interconnection ecosystem which helps implement a robust and scalable hybrid network with a wide choice of Telecom providers. These carriers also provide access to the eyeballs for all major Content Distribution Network (CDNs) and most of the largest Global Content providers (OTTs) present in GPX campus.

GPX is the only data center campus in India with presence of five Internet Exchanges: AMS-IX Bharat IX DE-CIX Extreme IX and NIXI . Interconnect solutions offered by IXes enable low latency cost effective connectivity between businesses and their remote workforce partners and customers. Enterprises can save on the bandwidth cost more so in the current situation when the LAN traffic has been replaced by internet traffic.

Financial companies like e-commerce payment gateways banking institutions including stock exchanges can set up their edge node inside the data center and connect to Internet Exchanges. An IX allows connectivity to multiple ISPs and carriers in a most reliable environment with improved latency and low cost. This helps financial companies to pass on the speed cost and reliability advantages to their end users/ customers.

GPX: India’s first DC to launch an ‘Open Cloud Exchange’

A Cloud Exchange enables enterprises to connect to multiple cloud providers via a single port. GPX Open Cloud Exchange service enables direct private and secure connection to multiple CSPs hosted inside the same GPX Mumbai data center campus where the cloud exchange is hosted. Through a cloud exchange GPX has come up with an easy way for enterprises to off-load their IT workloads to multiple CSPs in a LAN setup with high flexibility with scalable interconnection capacity from 50 Mbps to 1G/ 10G.

Enterprises not colocated at GPX can take a leased line or MPLS link to the GPX data center and connect to the cloud exchange on a single port and leverage the flexibility to connect to multiple CSPs for a multi-cloud strategy. Enterprises can also save on the download charges of CSP as the charges are much lower in case of a dedicated connection to a CSP through a cloud exchange as compared to connecting over internet.

Edge Data Centers with a dense Interconnection Ecosystem will emerge as a vital building block of enterprise's digital roadmap and business strategy.

Moore Jr. pictured here with POOR Magazine’s Tiny Gray-Garcia has lived in the Acton Courtyard Apartments in Berkeley for 17 years experiencing the same difficulties disabled people report facing due to neglect of subsidized housing all over the country from broken elevators to bedbugs. – Photo: San Francisco State University

by Leroy F. Moore Jr.

It was 2004-05 when I saw Acton Courtyard go up because I lived next door in a small studio and saw an empty lot grow into a beautiful state-of-the-art large apartment complex. I was excited for a chance to go from a studio that was so small I had to go outside to change my mind.

I was new to Berkeley because like many others I was gentrified from the Mission District in San Francisco. I pulled all the strings to get an emergency housing voucher – getting letters from the mayor of Berkeley and from Rep. Barbara Lee and other housing advocates. Plus an agency for people with disabilities helped out a lot!

I was one of the first groups of people to move into Acton Courtyard and it was beautiful clean and came with cable free wifi and more. The beauty didn’t last as the property changed owners constantly. Original residents started to move out. That’s when Equity Residential started to come after me with notes and phone calls saying that I didn’t pay rent for months.

After going through the hassle of dealing with my bank to prove that they were wrong I realized another long-time resident was dealing with the same harassment. Then came the broken elevator in 2015 that lasted almost a month over the Thanksgiving holiday until we wrote an article in the Berkeley Planet and got a lawyer. That case took almost three years to settle. Our collective sustained efforts strengthened local laws related to repairing elevators and the need for more inspections and notifications for residents when the work will be done.

Now in 2021 my neighbors and I have seen a drastic cutback in the upkeep of the building – from spots on the dirty carpet to dead plants racist stickers and urine in the elevator. It has been a slow crawl to criminal malfeasance which happens in buildings serving low and no-income tenants by landlords who don’t care.

My second hotel stay was in March 2021 because of infestation of bedbugs. Both times my community – aka Poor Magazine and a friend – saved me by helping me throw 95 percent of my clothes and furniture out and raise emergency funds to put me up in a hotel.

I found out that the new owner sold its other properties that were nicer compared to Acton Courtyard. Equity Residential tried to sell Acton Courtyard but no one wanted it. In 2016 I asked if I could transfer to another Berkeley unit before they sold them off. The landlord told me that it was an eight-year waiting list just to transfer to another building.

At the same time I would come home from college campus lectures in places like New York to Toronto and see a three-day eviction notice. It happened over and over again! Another change: The so-called upper-class residents were leaving quickly. Acton Courtyard became a building for only low-income residents and that’s when the cutback of services in the building started from firing the live-in manager to keeping the carpet clean and letting plants die.

In 2015 managers of Acton Courtyard Apartments in Berkeley became notorious for failing for weeks to fix broken elevators in the complex which houses multiple disabled individuals and families who became trapped in their apartments unable to leave as a result of the severe negligence of the building by property manager Equity Residential. – Photo: Equity Residential

I know that the cutbacks on the upkeep of the building have led to the year-long outbreak of bedbugs that infested my apartment in fall 2020. And because the landlord has not taken this outbreak of bedbugs seriously I had to stay in a local hotel almost all on my own dime and with help from friends.

I started typing this from my second hotel stay in March 2021 because of infestation of bedbugs. Both times my community – aka Poor Magazine and a friend – saved me by helping me throw 95 percent of my clothes and furniture out and raise emergency funds to put me up in a hotel.

The first time I was away from my apartment for almost two months between the hotel and an offer from a friend to stay at her place. In turn the landlord offered me $1500 to reimburse me for my hotel stay and the contract they wanted me to sign said that Acton Courtyard used a heat treatment to kill the bedbugs.

You can’t tell me that the city is not in the pocket of the landlord.

In addition I must bring up that before my friend and Poor Magazine got me into a hotel the landlord was rude to me and my sister. They told me that it was up to me to clean the apartment and get it ready for the treatment. When I reminded them that I have certain accommodations as a disabled person they told me that “maybe your family or in-home support person can help you clean”!

Before I moved back in the first time in January 2021 I called the city to come to inspect my place. The city inspector came and saw two bedbugs. On Jan. 16 2021 I moved back into my place and noticed that the landlord didn’t clean the carpet so I hired a company to deep clean my carpets on my dime.

Two weeks back in my apartment I noticed I was beginning again to itch. Then two bedbugs appeared on my white pillowcase. I stayed as long as I could handle it. Once again my friends came in and got me to the same hotel in March 2021.

The city came out again and noticed bedbugs in their own traps they put down in my apartment plus two bedbugs on my bed. The company that my building hired to treat the bedbugs had this conversation with me:

Bedbug company guy: It’s getting better.

Leroy: Look on my pillow.

Bedbug company guy: But it’s only two and only in the living room.

Leroy: But as you see there is nothing in the bedroom and I sleep in the living room where the city person found three in their trap and as you can see on my pillow and sheet – at least three!

Bedbug company guy: But Leroy you have to admit it’s getting better!

Leroy: But … never mind …

I started writing this on March 16 2021 my last night in the hotel. After not hearing from my landlord on when the treatment would be over and when would it be safe to move back in I emailed to ask when the treatment would be done. They emailed me back to say yes the treatment was done and it’s safe to move back in.

I saw bedbugs on my pillow I decided to sleep in the bathroom – sometimes in a chair and sometimes in the tub.

Throughout this bedbug situation my friends and the organization Poor Magazine have not only put me up at a hotel but have helped throw away 95 percent of my clothing and furniture and buy and wash new clothes but they also started a fundraiser and made sure I had food!

As I make my way back to my apartment for the second time after being dis/misplaced my confidence in my landlord to do the right thing – like treating the whole building or at least my neighbors – is on zero. So that’s why the only option is to write my story and also look for another place to live in Berkeley!

– Leroy F. Moore Jr. March 14 2021

March 19 2021: Hold up! I go on Berkeley Tenants Union to speak to a lawyer. It cost five dollars to type questions then they gave me an option to get a call from a lawyer for $60.00. So I took it and paid them. That was yesterday – still no call. WTF. You can’t tell me that the city is not in the pocket of the landlord.

I emailed the landlord to let them know that more bedbugs appeared after I returned. Their reply: “Those bedbugs you saw may be coming out due to the pesticide treatment. If we still see them two weeks from now then it will be a problem. That’s why I would like to wait two weeks before setting the traps in your apartment unit.”

The reporter who visited my apartment on March 21 2021 called me to let me know that he found four bedbugs in his place – not in Acton Courtyard.

The first time I returned to my place my neighbors said I looked healthier. I did notice that dark circles around my eyes were slowly disappearing. The second time I returned to 1370 University Ave. and saw bedbugs on my pillow I decided to sleep in the bathroom – sometimes in a chair and sometimes in the tub.

After a few days I noticed my feet and my lower legs started to swell up. A friend offered that my feet were swelling because I was sleeping in the chair. I had no choice but to return to my bed. To be clear: at the same time my landlord and a city employee told me that I was overreacting and just wait a couple of days and the bedbugs would be gone.

Sleeping in the Bathroom

I didn’t want to write this song

It’s just not right it so so wrong

My bed has bedbugs

Sleeping in the bathroom I need a hug

The city says it’s getting better

As bedbugs make a ladder

To get to my pillow

Eye to eye as I kill it I have no sorrow

I’ll be sleeping in the bathroom tomorrow

Scratching the itch over and over

The city says it’s getting better

As they form a ladder trying to suck my blood

I didn’t want to write this song

It’s just not right it so so wrong

My bed has bedbugs

Sleeping in the bathroom I need a hug

At night my bed they flood

Wake up in the morning and they are gone

I’m itching all day this is so wrong

Another night in the bathroom with a fat bong

Got to get high cause I can’t believe this is my life

Every month I still pay my rent on time

Slumlord I want to take your life

As The Coup’s song plays over and over

Have you tried sleeping in the bathtub

My skin I’m trying to rub

To smooth my bones as it hits fiberglass

Relief finally not scratching my ass

I didn’t want to write this song

It’s just not right it so so wrong

My bed has bedbugs

Sleeping in the bathroom I need a hug

How did it end up like this

This is some bullshit

From the bedroom to the living room

Now sleeping in the bathroom.

– Leroy F. Moore Jr. 2:50 a.m. March 20 2021

March 24 2021: Knock! knock! Yes it was my freakin’ landlord just now wanted to spray! Yeah no notice no nothing! I told them to send me so I can put it in my freakin’ calendar! WTF!

March 25 2021: I just want to note that yesterday March 24 2021 Acton Courtyard Apartments and the bedbug company knocked on my door to spray around my apartment. I told them to give me notice by email and to come back tomorrow. Today another knock on the door – it’s the bedbug company guy to spray. I said OK and he did. However I never got that email to reschedule. Now I need to open windows and leave for some time so it can air out!

March 29 2021: The reporter who visited my apartment on March 21 2021 called me to let me know that he found four bedbugs in his place – not in Acton Courtyard – this morning. As of March 30 2021 I have not seen more bedbugs in my apartment at this time.

I’ve lived at Acton Courtyard for just about 17 years – experiencing some good times ongoing harassment from Equity Residential and now bedbugs throwing away 95 percent of my things and risking my health. The handwriting is on the wall saying that I must continue my search for a new place to live in Berkeley!

Me and the Krip-Hop Nation that I founded have big plans and we want to continue our work in Berkeley establishing a Krip-Hop Institute and becoming the Berkeley poet laureate one day. So as you can see I must remain in Berkeley.

We all know by now that having a nice garden is an appealing feature to many home buyers especially since the pandemic has forced most of us to stay at home – which has often meant using our outdoor spaces as extensions of our living rooms kitchens and dining rooms.

See: Backyard ideas – decor inspiration for outdoor spaces

But when it comes to selling is improving your backyard really one of the best ways to add value and if so which improvements should you prioritize? We investigate.

How much value does a nice backyard add?

Knowing how much value a nice backyard will add is only ever going to be an estimate – and your realtor should always be the person to ask for their expert opinion on what will work in your area before you start planning.

However having a ball park figure will help you decide what to spend on landscaping to get a good return on investment. As a rough guide a nicely landscaped garden that is low maintenance can add up to 10% to your home's value – that's potentially an extra $100000 on a $1 million home.

It is worth underlining that you will rarely make a profit on landscaping a backyard – but done wisely you should make your money back by adding value to your home and will certainly have a better chance of selling your home faster and for a higher price.

Backyard improvements that add value

Assuming the essential improvements in your backyard – from sound fencing to a smart patio and decking to pretty planting – have been taken care of which are the backyard improvements to consider as potentially value-adding? These are our top five.

1. An outdoor kitchen

Outdoor kitchen ideas have surged in popularity with homeowners looking to extend their living rooms outdoors.

Patrick Garrett a real estate broker in Birmingham Alabama advises that it's really important to ensure your outdoor kitchen space is functional – think: a properly equipped space a roof for shelter from the sun and rain a ceiling fan or a design that relies on natural ventilation for comfort in hot weather and a firepit for outdoor heating for cooler nights. In other words he says it needs to be usable at least 'three out of four seasons'.

2. An outdoor firepit

You will recoup around 60 to 70% of your investment on a beautifully installed firepit says Jason Gelios of Community Choice Realty in Detroit who suggests that a gas-powered fire pit installation will have the best return on investment. If you don't have the space for a permanent structure even a firepit that can be packed away when not in use – but brought out for property viewings – can help the buyer imagine themselves using the backyard as an outdoor living room year round.

3. A swimming pool

Bill Golden a realtor/associate broker at RE/MAX in Atlanta says that the pandemic has changed how buyers feel about properties with pools. 'People are spending way more time at home now and that has increased the demand for pools' he says. He is however at pains to point out that you won't necessarily recoup what you spend but that it can be a selling point when you put your home on the market – a significant bonus if your house is competing with other homes (with pools) on the market locally.

4. Structures for privacy and shade

(Image credit: Future / Mark Luscombe Whyte)

Since more and more of us are spending more time outdoors it's no surprise that looking for garden privacy ideas has become something of an obsession for many during the pandemic.

Of course you can create effective screening with cleverly placed plants but a structured garden shade idea such as a roof over an outdoor kitchen/dining/living area or a smart pergola over a patio can give you the best of all worlds: privacy shelter and shade.

5. An outdoor living space

(Image credit: Little Greene)

You may already have a patio or deck in your garden – but how you set them up can really matter to home buyers and boost your home's value.

'It's really important to lay out and dress a deck or patio like you would an indoor room' advises Homes & Gardens Editor in Chief Lucy Searle. 'The good news is that this won't cost a fortune and can add value – or at least enchant a buyer enough that they will be more likely to put in an offer.

When it comes to designing a deck or picking patio ideas it's important to this about how the space will be used: 'Ideally you need space for a snug seating area – somewhere buyers can picture themselves lounging and/or dining' says Lucy.

'Style it with handsome inviting furniture perhaps an outdoor rug or cushions attractive garden lighting and pretty container planting and you add an entirely new living space to your home instantly.'

Backyard improvements can add value – but there is a catch

(Image credit: Future / Mark Bolton Photography)

The good news is that yes garden improvements can add value to your home. They're probably not what you expected however. The Remodeling Impact Report: Outdoor Features from the National Association of Realtors® found that while buyers loved the idea of a swimming pool brand-new deck and other luxurious backyard features what they were actually prepared to pay more for was a garden that's impeccably landscaped and well maintained.

The report estimates the cost of annual mulch application mowing of 2835 square feet of lawn pruning of shrubs and planting of approximately 60 perennials or annuals to add up to an average of $3000. It is a lot but you will recover all of this cost – an incredible 100% return on investment.

See: Backyard landscaping ideas – how to create the perfect terrace garden or lawn for your home

There is a potential problem with all of this. What the report uncovers is that the majority of US home buyers are not that keen on garden maintenance preferring the idea of moving into a home with a garden that doesn't need anything doing to it.

What this means in practice is that while those who do want a garden will pay more for a well-maintained one you may also lose some buyers who are intimidated by the idea of having to do all that maintenance themselves.

Kelley Martin a realtor in San Antonio Texas told Homelight that in her experience 'About 7 out of 10 [buyers] will say '‘There’s no way I can maintain that'’ or ‘'How much is that going to cost to maintain?’' or '‘Oh my gosh I would kill every single one of those.”'

(Image credit: Future)

It's very different if you live in the UK where more people are prepared to maintain their gardens over the longer term. UK home buyers will pay more for additional structures so they can enjoy their garden more with a study by Rated People revealing that Brits will pay almost £8000 ($11000) more for a swimming pool £5325 ($7378) for a home office garden room and £5107 ($7076) for a garden gym.

None of these things will make US buyers part with more of their cash even if they do like the idea of them. More proof that it always pays to understand who you're selling to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpc21lZGlhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L2ZhaXItaG91c2luZy1iZW5lZml0cy1lYmVyeW9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fair Housing Benefits Everyone — RISMedia,"Honor Fair Housing Month by Taking Action

Fair Housing Month each April marks the April 1968 passage of the federal Fair Housing Act. The act expanded in 1988 prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race color national origin religion sex familial status and disability—and commits the federal government to curtail residential segregation. The REALTOR® Code of Ethics builds on the federal law and also prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

But while progress has been made the promise of fair housing remains unfulfilled. In 2018 50 years after passage of the Fair Housing Act the Black homeownership rate was 30 percentage points below that of white Americans and that disparity remains today.

November 2019 brought evidence of the need to strengthen fair housing education and enforcement. That’s when Newsday released the results of its three-year investigation showing unequal treatment by local real estate agents 49% of the time against Blacks 39% of the time against Hispanics and 19% of the time against Asians.

A Commitment to ‘Act!’

As part of its year-long commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) pledged to do more. Since then “NAR has redoubled its commitment to fighting for fair housing and equal opportunity for all” notes Bryan Greene vice president of policy advocacy. “Part of that involves giving our members tools to adhere to the REALTOR® Code of Ethics follow the law and become advocates for fair housing ensuring that everyone is treated equally while searching for a home.”

In early 2020 NAR launched the ACT! Initiative a fair housing action plan emphasizing accountability culture change and training. Its goal is to ensure that REALTORS® lead the charge against housing discrimination by promoting equity fighting racial bias and helping to build more inclusive communities.

Fair Housing Is Not Just Fair

“Fair housing is good for business good for your community and good for the economy” says Greene. “Discrimination distorts the marketplace prevents qualified buyers from accessing housing opportunities and denies neighborhoods the benefit of integration. It can cost agents commissions and stifle our economy by reducing the size of the pie. Conversely when segregation is addressed and strong fair housing laws and practices are in place all boats are lifted.”

NAR is committed to championing efforts that ensure equal access to homeownership during Fair Housing Month and every day of the year. We are asking all REALTORS® to join the fight to end discrimination in housing and stand up for diverse inclusive communities where everyone can thrive.

How Can You Honor Fair Housing Month?

Take advantage of these invaluable tools and resources:

Fairhaven: A Fair Housing Simulation

This online training uses the power of storytelling to help agents identify prevent and address discriminatory practices. It requires users to respond to real-life scenarios and confront discrimination from both the agent’s and homebuyer’s viewpoint. Users receive customized feedback.

Implicit Bias Training

An online training video and classroom curriculum help agents understand how our unconscious brains associate stereotypes with people from different backgrounds causing us to treat people unfairly without intent or conscious awareness. The classroom training which qualifies for CE credit in some states offers practical tools customized to the real estate context to help override hidden biases.

Fair Housing Month Proclamation

Spread the word about fair housing beyond your office by asking your local political leaders to pass this proclamation.

Encourage Your Agents to Grow Their Fair Housing Awareness

Start by sending agents to the fictional town of Fairhaven at nar.realtor/fairhaven. They can take the innovative immersive training at their own pace then explore all the fair housing resources available at www.nar.realtor/fair-housing.",,,,,,

While the world’s biggest beauty company was far from immune to the unprecedented global situation in 2020 it limited losses thanks in part to the strength of its digital capabilities and of the Active Cosmetics division which resonated with consumers’ increased focus on health and the high demand for skin care. Implementing rigorous cost-control measures the company achieved an operating margin of 18.6 percent stable versus 2019. L’Oréal believes that its adaptation to the unprecedented context which drove it to accelerate transformation initiatives will help it to emerge stronger for the future.

E-commerce sales gained 62 percent and represented 26.6 percent of total revenues for the year.

The company noted an uptick in the second half notably in the last quarter when sales in all but the Consumer Products division gained on a like-for-like basis. With sales breaking the 3 billion euro barrier for the first time Active Cosmetics did particularly well in North America and Asia. CeraVe La Roche-Posay and SkinCeuticals which the company said were aligned with consumers’ health preoccupations and recommended by medical professionals all saw strong growth. CeraVe’s sales in particular almost doubled. Vichy benefited from the launch of Liftactiv Supreme H.A. Epidermic Filler.

The Consumer Products division stabilized in the second half despite the weight of the makeup category in its portfolio and increased its market share in other key categories. It saw double-digit growth in hair color; hair care was propelled by Fructis Hair Food and Elsève Dream Long as well as the launches of Elsève Full Resist and Ultra Doux solid shampoos. L’Oréal Paris serums and Garnier’s Fast Bright range were drivers in skin care while despite the overall downturn in makeup NYX and 3CE Stylenanda benefited from their digital focus.

Professional Products bounced back in the second half and outperformed the market through the year according to L’Oréal. The digitalization of salons the development of freelance stylists and an explosion of e-commerce were all key trends. In the U.S. the SalonCentric distribution channel posted strong growth. The division also performed well in China especially on Tmall.

L’Oréal Luxe despite the difficulties seen in prestige distribution in most parts of the world returned to growth in the last three months of the year in both reported and like-for-like terms. The division’s performance was boosted by initiatives to accelerate e-commerce particularly direct-to-consumer the decision to maintain major launches and a focus on China. The division outperformed the luxury market — which declined by an estimated 14 percent — in all three prestige categories L’Oréal said. Lancôme Kiehl’s and Helena Rubinstein did well in skin care. Fragrance launches including My Way by Giorgio Armani Voce Viva from Valentino and Libre by Yves Saint Laurent also helped to drive sales.

By region the company described its performance in China as “spectacular” saying the country’s contribution to overall sales for the year was significant. L’Oréal’s Chinese sales gained 24.1 percent for the year. Lancôme and L’Oréal Paris were the leading selective and mass-market brands respectively on Tmall in the market.

Much speculated about over the past couple of years a successor for Jean-Paul Agon L’Oréal’s chairman and chief executive officer who reaches France’s legal retirement age of 65 in 2021 was announced in October. This May Nicolas Hieronimus will take over as CEO a decision lauded by the financial community. Agon will maintain the role of chairman. Hieronimus had been deputy CEO in charge of divisions since May 2017 when he started working side-by-side with Agon. He joined L’Oréal in 1987 as a product manager fresh out of ESSEC one of France’s top business schools. When he headed Garnier he was behind the launch of hair care range Fructis. As international manager of L’Oréal Paris he positioned the brand in the accessible luxury segment. In 2011 he was named president of L’Oréal Luxe then in 2013 took on the additional role for Selective divisions in charge of Active Cosmetics and Professional Products as well as the company’s prestige arm.

Over the past year he was instrumental in helping the group shift gears to help navigate the coronavirus pandemic and mitigate its impact.

Barbara Lavernos was named president of research innovation and technologies in October effective Feb. 1 2021. She will also take on the role of deputy CEO previously held by Hieronimus in May.

In May 2020 Myriam Cohen-Welgryn joined L’Oréal as president of the Active Cosmetics division and became a member of its executive committee. The executive who has held senior management positions at PepsiCo Danone Group and Mars replaced Brigitte Liberman who has retired.

November saw the naming of Frédéric Rozé as chief global growth officer. All of L’Oréal’s regional presidents as well as the travel-retail business will now report to Rozé.

L’Oréal restructured the scope of its reporting last November for its geographical zones. Its New Markets activity will now be divided to better represent the weight of the different markets. North Asia (mainland China Hong Kong Taiwan Japan and South Korea) will be led by Fabrice Megarbane currently CEO of L’Oréal China. A new zone dubbed SAPMENA was created for South Asia Pacific Middle East and North Africa and will be managed by Vismay Sharma the current managing director for the U.K. and Ireland. Sub-Saharan Africa will be headed by Burkhard Pieroth previously managing director of the Consumer Products division for emerging markets.

At the end of March 2020 the company closed its acquisition of Groupe Clarins’ fragrance activity integrating the Mugler and Azzaro brands into its portfolio part of a drive to strengthen its perfume portfolio. U.S.-based mass skin care brand Thayers Natural Remedies joined the company in June and in December the firm invested in social selling platform Replika Software Inc. Roger & Gallet a mid-market fragrance brand sold in pharmacies was divested to French investment concern Impala in a deal that closed in June. The company also shuttered Clarisonic the device brand it acquired in 2011 that failed to meet expectations.

In December L’Oréal announced that it would acquire Japanese skin care company Takami Co. which had sales of €50 million in 2019. The deal was finalized in February 2021 and adds a digital-first Asian skin care brand to L’Oréal’s portfolio.

Sustainability continued to be a major focus and the firm introduced L’Oréal for the Future a series of new sustainability commitments for 2030 which involve a range of initiatives to limit the environmental impact of L’Oréal’s suppliers and the use of its products by consumers as well as its own activities. As part of the program the company has allocated €100 million to invest in regenerating ecosystems and help develop the circular economy and €50 million to a fund to support vulnerable women.

It was a challenging first 18 months on the job for Sunny Jain Unilever’s president of Beauty and Personal Care who took on the role in June 2019.

In the unprecedented context of the global pandemic Jain began laying the foundations for making Unilever “the most people- and planet-positive beauty business in the entire world” he told Beauty Inc in an exclusive interview in December.

This purpose-driven approach — seen as key to resonating with consumers — was visible in initiatives under several of Unilever’s beauty brands last year. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and growing demand for a more inclusive discourse in beauty the company renamed the Fair & Lovely skin care brand Glow & Lovely. More broadly Unilever committed to removing terms like fair/fairness white/whitening and light/lightening from all of its products packs and communication globally.

In the U.S. Dove cofounded the CROWN Coalition which advocates for legislation that outlaws race-based hair discrimination while Vaseline partnered with Medscape to train dermatologists and medical practitioners to better treat diagnose and care for diverse skin tones. In the U.S. the company launched a new skin care brand Mele designed for and co-created with women and dermatologists with melanin-rich skin.

Several brands initiated campaigns designed to help consumers feel good about themselves during lockdowns. Dove’s “Courage Is Beautiful” campaign featuring frontline workers received several awards. Deodorant brand Rexona (branded as Sure and Degree in certain markets) launched the #MoveMoreAtHome initiative to encourage people to be active during lockdowns and contribute to wellbeing. Clear launched #ComeBackStronger to help consumers manage their mental wellbeing. Brand-wise there was also the co-creation with Walmart of Find Your Happy Place a new line of bath and body products intended to enhance wellbeing.

In December Unilever said it plans to put its climate action targets to shareholders to vote on starting this year. In June 2020 the company announced a new target of zero net emissions from sourcing to point of sale by 2039.

During the year Sunsilk Suave and Chistaya Liniya joined the ranks of PETA-approved brands which now number 23 in Unilever’s Beauty and Personal Care portfolio. Love Beauty and Planet launched refillable aluminum bottles for its shampoo and conditioner in the U.S. and in the U.K. the company initiated a refill trial in collaboration with Asda.

In terms of performance skin cleansing was the main sales driver for the Beauty and Personal Care division. Thanks to growth in demand for hygiene products Lifebuoy became Unilever’s sixth billion-euro beauty and personal care brand during 2020. The brand entered 58 new markets and launched “H for Handwashing” an educational campaign to teach children about handwashing.

Demand decreased though for Unilever’s skin care deodorants and hair care products. Skin care declined in the high-single digits while deodorant sales dropped in the mid-single digits. In hair care growth in demand for washing and care products offset declines in styling with the category seeing a low-single-digit decrease in sales.

In the prestige business which has been a pillar of Unilever’s strategy in recent years sales declined in the low-single digits but the company said it was nevertheless the best-performing luxury beauty business on the market last year. It generated sales in the region of €700 million 50 percent of which were done online — compared with

9 percent for Unilever’s business overall.

The company is also flexing its muscles in what it sees as the high growth markets of the future the U.S. India and China where Unilever debuted its first external incubator dubbed the Uni-Excubator to collaborate with entrepreneurs and technology start-ups. The initiative involves a partnership with Tmall for a flagship store Uni-Topia Planet.

In India Unilever acquired Vwash an intimate hygiene business.

As to people Gülen Bengi joined Unilever as executive vice president of hair care reporting to Sunny Jain. She was formerly president North America for adult and feminine care at Kimberly-Clark. Jason Goldberger was named CEO of Dollar Shave Club as the digital native brand began entering physical retail.

In November Unilever finalized the unification of its group legal structure under a single parent company Unilever plc. The move removing Unilever’s unique dual structure with headquarters in both London and Rotterdam which had been in place since its inception in 1930 is intended to provide the company with “greater strategic flexibility…better positioned for

future success.”

Estée Lauder Cos. brands.

Sales at The Estée Lauder Cos. like most major beauty companies were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but the company was able to post growth in the final quarter of the year. The business was propelled by skin care China and online shopping while travel retail makeup and in-store sales remained sluggish as consumers continued to stay home.

Revenues across the Asia Pacific region but especially China played a major role in the company’s stability during the pandemic. For the year Asia Pacific sales were nearly $4.8 billion comprising about one-third of Lauder’s total sales. The company continues to bet on the region and is building a manufacturing facility in Tokyo and a new innovation center in Shanghai.

Lauder’s online sales skyrocketed in 2020 and now make up roughly 30 percent of the total business. Early in the pandemic Lauder teams across brands including sales associates pivoted to online selling through a combination of online advice shopping assistant options and social-media selling.

Skin care was a major bright spot for the company throughout the year. Dr. Jart+ which Lauder acquired in its entirety in 2019 contributed to sales gains. Full-year skin care sales were about $8.2 billion meaning skin care now makes up almost 60 percent of the total business.

Makeup sales which had already slumped as consumers continued to favor skin care continued to have a tough year. Lauder’s makeup business is now less than half the size of its skin care operation. In early 2021 Lauder said it would wind down Becca and industry sources have said the company started to consider divesting certain brands in makeup and hair. Prescriptives quietly closed at the end of 2020 and Lauder’s licensing deal with Kiton expired at the end of the year.

During the year Lauder participated in COVID-19 relief efforts including making donations of money and surgical masks as well as manufacturing hand sanitizer in its New York and European plants. The business also reached certain sustainability goals including net zero carbon emissions and 100 percent renewable electricity globally for its direct operations.

In June Lauder stepped up diversity commitments with a comprehensive five-year plan meant to ensure the company hires more Black employees and that those workers are mentored and promoted through the corporate ranks. The company was the first in beauty to release such a detailed action plan to address inequality after the resurgence of the social justice movement and has since provided updates on internal diversity figures. The plan was established after employees flocked to an online petition calling for the business to oust Ronald Lauder son of founder Estée from the board because he has donated money to former President Donald Trump.

During the year Lauder made several key promotions and hires: Jane Hertzmark Hudis was promoted to be the company’s first female executive group president; Stéphane de la Faverie was named group president and global brand president for Estée Lauder and Aerin; and Jane Lauder was named executive vice president of enterprise marketing and chief data officer.

For the next two years Lauder will focus on its post-COVID-19 Business Acceleration plan launched in August that includes rationalizing the store and counter footprint in Europe the Middle East and Africa and North America. The focus will continue to be on online sales and omnichannel operations.

Key financials:

Organic growth: +3%

2020 calendar year total company sales: $73.975 billion +6.3%

As a whole Procter & Gamble saw a massive lift in sales during 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic which had people staying home and stocking up on trusted household essentials. For the company’s beauty division sales echoed broader themes seen throughout the pandemic — consumers bought personal care and hair care and they didn’t shop in travel retail corridors.

For P&G those shifts resulted in new sales trends across the beauty portfolio which had been supercharged by SK-II in recent years. But during 2020 when travel retail sales shrank and SK-II’s expansion was tempered sales growth was instead bolstered by the sprawling nature of P&G Beauty’s portfolio. Overall P&G Beauty sales gained 3 percent year-over-year in 2020.

Growth was supported by the company’s personal care segment sales gains in the U.S. and China growth from newly acquired brands and e-commerce. Online P&G has seen massive sales gains. In the back half of 2020 online sales gained almost 50 percent P&G’s then chief financial officer Jon Moeller said.

Like all beauty companies P&G was challenged by the situation in travel retail and inbound business — a non-duty free form of travel retail — that impacted SK-II more than other brands.

In the personal care category P&G saw growth from brands like Safeguard which saw increased hand sanitizer and liquid hand soap sales and Old Spice which posted nearly $1 billion in sales for the year. P&G has focused on “premiumization” across the portfolio including in personal care.

In hair P&G grew business in the U.S. and in China. Both markets were up in the high-single digits or more P&G said. Head & Shoulders now a multibillion-dollar brand saw continued growth as did Pantene which continued to roll out relevant innovation including the Nutrient Blends line which features ingredients like rose water bamboo and biotin. In the U.S. Aussie grew in the mass hair care channel. P&G also increased its share in the textured hair category with My Black Is Beautiful Head & Shoulders Royal Oils and Pantene Gold Series which all grew during the year.

New brands — Native First Aid Beauty and Walker & Co. — also continue to grow disproportionately and now represent about 2 percent of P&G Beauty’s annual sales or about $280 million collectively. Native which makes deodorant body wash and other products was already nearing $100 million in annual sales in 2019.

In early 2021 P&G called off the planned acquisition of Billie a women’s personal care and grooming business after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal saying that it would “eliminate growing competition that benefits consumers.”

P&G continued to progress with sustainability goals in 2020. The company introduced “P&G Responsible Beauty” a broad approach to thinking that is meant to include quality performance safety transparency sustainability equality and inclusion across all aspects of the business. The company also experimented with new packaging including paper tubes for Secret and Old Spice deodorants.

2020 was the final year of Shiseido’s five-year Vision 2020 management plan which saw it work to focus more on consumers and enhance its brand value and Japanese heritage. It was also a tough year for Japan’s biggest beauty player.

Negatively impacted by the pandemic both at home and abroad Shiseido reported significant sales declines.

In Japan a sharp drop in the number of international tourists as well as consumers staying home resulted in falling sales although the company worked on providing enhanced beauty information to consumers and shifting business online where sales grew. It also worked to shift its focus in line with consumers’ new needs introducing innovations like a hand cream under Ultimune and a BB Cream that stays in place under a mask.

In China the market started to bounce back from March onward resulting in sales gains with prestige brands including Shiseido Clé de Peau Beauté IPSA and Nars growing significantly thanks to new counter openings and stronger investment in e-commerce. The company’s sales on Singles’ Day in November more than doubled and e-commerce represented more than 40 percent of the group’s Chinese revenues for the year.

In the rest of Asia particularly South Korea and Thailand sales fell but e-commerce gained significantly driven by the Shiseido and Senka brands.

In the Americas the major focus for the year was restructuring at BareMinerals and ramping up marketing for Drunk Elephant acquired in 2019. The company was impacted by retail closures — both temporary and permanent — and the makeup category was particularly challenging. E-commerce sales were strong notably thanks to Drunk Elephant.

In Europe the Middle East and Africa business was also strongly impacted by the pandemic but the company said its e-commerce business outpaced the market notably thanks to Shiseido-brand skin care. Clé de Peau Beauté launched in Italy and Spain and Drunk Elephant landed

in Germany.

In travel retail losses were tempered by the channel’s strong performance in Asia in part thanks to an influx of tourists to China’s Hainan Island and demand at South Korean downtown duty-free stores and e-commerce.

Shiseido stepped up its environmental activities in 2020 launching a global initiative called Sustainable Beauty Actions which will see it implementing a range of sustainability-focused activities and products. One such initiative saw the company install a refill station at its newly opened store in Tokyo’s Ginza district. It also released the world’s first biodegradable lip palette in November and said that it will make 100 percent of its packaging sustainable by 2025.

The year also saw Shiseido establish a joint venture with device-maker Ya-Man to create Effectim Co. Ltd. which started operations in October combining devices with beauty products and initially targeting China. It launched a new sustainable brand Baum. Plans were announced for a new innovation center in Shanghai’s The Oriental Beauty Valley.

In executive moves the company announced in October that Yoichi Shimatani would retire from his position as representative director and executive vice president at the end of the year. He was replaced by Yukari Suzuki whose title is representative director and executive corporate officer making her effectively number two at the company behind CEO Masahiko Uotani. She is the first woman to hold such a role.

Marc Rey president and CEO of Shiseido Americas and the group’s chief growth officer stepped down in September with Ron Gee the U.S.-based operations CFO and Shiseido’s global chief M&A officer stepping in as interim CEO.

Nicole Tan was named president and CEO of the Asia Pacific business effective Oct. 1. The former Estée Lauder Cos. executive is the first woman to hold a CEO title at Shiseido.

In February this year the company announced plans to spin off its personal care business in order to focus on its prestige activity with CVC Capital Partners snapping up the operation for $1.5 billion.

Total Bath & Body Works sales: $6.43 billion (EST.) +24.4%

Total Victoria’s Secret sales: $5.4 billion (EST.) -20.7%

L Brands saw an uptick in beauty sales in 2020 moving up in the top 10 companies ranking driven in significant part by soap and hand sanitizer purchases at Bath & Body Works.

Bath & Body Works did well ending 2020 with sales up more than 20 percent from the prior-year period to $6.4 billion. Business boomed despite store shutdowns early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Bath & Body Works’ direct business more than doubled during the year the company told Wall Street analysts. The direct business now makes up 31 percent of sales for Bath & Body Works or about $2 billion.

Soaps and hand sanitizers are now being thought of as a “third pillar of the business” according to CEO Andrew Meslow. Customers shopped more frequently across categories in 2020 he said and Bath & Body Works aimed to meet the desire for “nesting at home.” Customers who shopped for soap often bought home fragrances which also make up a significant part of the total business.

Victoria’s Secret has struggled — both because of store shutdowns and because of its outdated brand ethos which promotes women’s sexiness as defined by men. The company plans to change that it has said and switch to messaging that allows customers to decide what is sexy. Victoria’s Secret total sales dipped 20 percent during the year. Beauty sales traditionally comprise about 15 percent of the Victoria’s Secret business which would put them at about $810 million for the year. Victoria’s Secret direct channel sales increased by 31 percent.

In terms of physical retail Bath & Body works closed 30 stores during the year but opened 27 others. Victoria’s Secret closed 225 stores including six Victoria’s Secret Beauty and Accessories stores. L Brands collectively ended the year with 2669 stores 278 fewer than the prior-year period.

L Brands spent much of 2020 restructuring the company to prepare both brands to operate as separate businesses. The company also laid out a plan to reduce costs that included layoffs of about 15 percent of its corporate headquarters or about 850 people.

The business had inked a deal to sell Victoria’s Secret to Sycamore Partners but it fell through early on in the pandemic. L Brands still plans to separate the two businesses with a stand-alone Bath & Body Works looking to veer out of mall-based retail. The separation could come sometime in 2021 but timing is not confirmed.

Les Wexner the founder longtime chairman and CEO of L Brands stepped down from his post during the year after being tied to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

It was a year of massive change for Brazil’s Natura & Co. as it integrated Avon’s business and navigated the pandemic with its inherent shift toward online and social selling. The company said it performed 6 percentage points ahead of the global cosmetics and fragrance market for the year and it became the first Brazilian beauty company to enter the top 10 of this ranking.

“This extraordinary year which began with us welcoming Avon into our family of iconic brands just as the pandemic began to spread actually accelerated many of our strategic initiatives and made us truly omnichannel” stated the company’s executive chairman and CEO Roberto Marques when the firm released its 2020 results.

The integration makes Natura & Co. the world’s fourth biggest pure-play beauty company it said at the time of the acquisition.

Digital sales for the group gained 79 percent in the final quarter of the year. It signed a strategic partnership with Singu a Brazilian digital platform for at-home beauty services and launched &Co Pay a proprietary financial services platform. Online accounted for around 30 percent of the group’s sales for the year compared with 10 percent a year earlier.

A key area of focus was integrating Avon as the company worked to optimize synergies between the two direct-sales player’s Latin American operations in particular notably through merging the two brands’ logistics for example. The company said it had advanced well with the integration with synergies materializing ahead of plan.

It worked to simplify Avon’s commercial model across all markets with a monthly campaign and a new earnings model. It initiated rebranding and linked with social causes including fighting domestic violence and racism and promoting gender equality. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on Avon’s operations in Europe and in the makeup and fragrance categories it said it saw market share gains in the U.K. and improvements in Russia. Overall the brand’s sales — in Latin America and elsewhere (Natura now reports Avon’s Latin American business within its overall activity for the region) — grew 0.4 percent in Brazilian real but dropped 14.5 percent at constant currency.

Under Natura social selling was a major focus. For the brand’s Latin American operations the number of consultants sharing content online grew by more than 300 percent between the first and final quarters of the year. More than 1 million Natura consultants in the region had online stores and the number of orders processed through these grew 60 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the prior-year period.

The brand also opened a new flagship in São Paulo on the street where it launched its first store 50 years earlier. The boutique offers experiences including personalized gifting and digital fragrance testing as well as digital experiences to raise awareness of communities in the Amazon rainforest. Visitors receive a free product when they return five empty packs to promote minimizing the environmental impact of packaging waste.

The company bought back The Body Shop’s operations in Japan launched The Body Shop At-Home in the U.S. and progressed with plans to launch the operation in China. The Body Shop closed 93 stores net through the year and rolled out its new store concept to 13 locations.

Aesop performed particularly well with its sales up 50 percent for the year or 13.2 percent at constant currency thanks to strong growth online especially in Asia with the brand introducing digital features such as live chats new payment platforms and same-day delivery. Japan became the brand’s largest market. Aesop put its store-expansion program on hold due to the pandemic.

Already a leader when it came to sustainability Natura & Co. launched a new action plan for the next 10 years dubbed “Commitment to Life.” It includes plans to become zero net carbon reinforces initiatives to protect the Amazon improves gender equality and human rights in the workforce for its representatives and for suppliers and offers fully circular packaging and 95 percent renewable or natural and biodegradable ingredients by 2030. In late 2020 Natura & Co. also received B Corp certification at group level becoming the largest corporation in the world to have the distinction.

Product-wise innovations included new fragrances from Natura the introduction of Anew Protinol skin care from Avon based on proprietary technology for accelerating collagen production and the Winter Jasmine line from

The Body Shop.

The company initiated two capital increases raising a total of R7.6 billion.

Beiersdorf continued to progress with its C.A.R.E.+ strategic program last year aimed at better positioning the German firm when it comes to sustainability digitalization and growth markets. It said this focus helped it to gain market share in all of its skin care categories with its core brands and in all regions during the year.

Nivea the company’s biggest brand saw its sales drop nearly 11 percent to €3.96 billion or 6 percent on an organic basis although the brand reportedly gained market share in more than half of the countries in which it is present. The sales decline for the Consumer business unit was cushioned by strong performance in the Derma business thanks to the Eucerin and Aquaphor brands. That unit saw sales growth of 5.3 percent to €661 million or 8.3 percent on an organic basis and double-digit gains in North America Latin America and Asia.

La Prairie saw significant declines largely due to its exposure to travel retail. Sales fell 23.9 percent to €497 million despite double-digit growth in China. The company is hopeful that its recent launch on Tmall will help bolster sales looking ahead.

Both Nivea and Eucerin gained market share in China.

Eucerin introduced the Hyaluron Filler + Elasticity 3D Serum based on patented active ingredient Thiamidol. Nivea expanded the Naturally Good range.

Group-wide e-commerce sales jumped 50 percent. The company introduced the Nivea Skin Guide app which uses AI to help consumers identify skin issues track skin changes as well as recommending products and offering skin care tips.

In July Beiersdorf opened a new innovation center in Shanghai key to boosting its local expertise in Asia. Its biggest such facility outside Hamburg the development involved an investment of €10 million.

Chaul a brand developed exclusively for the Asian market based on fermented tea was launched in South Korea the first homegrown brand to come out of the NX Accelerator in Seoul which Beiersdorf opened in 2019.

The company debuted a new sustainability agenda Care Beyond Skin in early 2020. During the year important progress was made including a switch to recycled materials for 90 percent of the Consumer division’s PET bottles in Europe and the use of only sustainably certified palm oil in cosmetics manufacturing. Toward the end of the year the firm teamed up with chemicals company SABIC to create renewable PP plastic for its beauty packaging based on a byproduct of the paper industry.

In Germany it introduced its first shower gel refill stations with drugstore chain DM and has partnered with Loop to test reusable packaging under Nivea for Men. It is also participating in trials of digital watermarking technology to improve waste sorting and thereby the availability of recycled plastic content.

In February 2020 the company snapped up Stop the Water While Using Me! a German natural personal care line offering refillable systems and biodegradable formulas.

For the C.A.R.E.+ program Beiersdorf has said it will invest another €300 million over the next five years — in addition to the €70 million to €80 million per year initially planned — to accelerate its transformation.

In order to enhance its innovation capabilities Beiersdorf said it would invest €60 million in a technology center at its headquarters in Hamburg by the end of 2024. The new center will allow employees and external partners including researchers startups and suppliers to explore new concepts.

With its portfolio weighted heavily in prestige LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s beauty business in 2020 was significantly impacted by declines in spending by international travelers and the weakness of the makeup category. The company said losses were partially offset by the stronger performance of both skin care and the Asian market through the year though it acknowledged that both also saw sales declines. According to estimates the company’s beauty sales in Asia — outside Japan — dropped by around 13.6 percent last year compared with around 30 percent in most other markets. Asia (excluding Japan) accounted for 45 percent of the Perfumes and Cosmetics division’s revenues in 2020 up from 40 percent a year earlier.

The company cited Guerlain and Fresh as proving resilient despite the context but acknowledged sales declines from both brands nonetheless.

Core brand Dior’s business improved in the second half LVMH said especially in China the U.S. Japan and the Middle East. Its online sales grew especially in China.

Guerlain’s skin care offer was a strong point notably in China its biggest market with key lines Abeille Royale and Orchidée Impériale seeing “exceptional” growth. The brand continued to highlight its sustainability projects introducing a new design approach and implementing bee protection initiatives in partnership with UNESCO.

Givenchy also performed well in China notably thanks to Prisme Libre. The L’Interdit fragrance registered market share gains in Europe especially France. Benefit whose cofounder Jane Ford passed away in December was hit by the limited availability of its services due to store closures but saw strong momentum for its online sales. Fresh also focused on digital especially in China and its premium line Crème Ancienne performed well as did Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence. Fenty Beauty generated buzz with the online-only launch of the Fenty Skin range. Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s growth accelerated notably with the new L’Homme à la Rose scent while Acqua di Parma expanded in China. Perfumes Loewe which launched a range of home scents saw solid momentum in China.

The beauty division’s operating margin fell from 10 percent to 1.5 percent despite efforts to manage costs.

The changing of the guard for LVMH’s beauty activity implemented in late 2019 continued with Parfums Christian Dior naming Claudia Marcocci formerly senior vice president of Gucci Beauty at Coty as its new brand general director in February succeeding Véronique Courtois who moved over to head Guerlain in 2019.

Sephora rejigged its top management. Martin Brok a former Starbucks executive was named president and CEO in September reporting to previous head Chris de Lapuente who has been named president and CEO of LVMH’s Selective Retailing division effective Jan. 1 2021. Artemis Patrick was named executive vice president global chief merchandising officer for Sephora a newly created role in August. Previously chief merchandising officer for Sephora U.S. she is known for having shaped major new categories including indie fragrances and clean beauty.

Change was also in the air at brand incubation division Kendo which has laid off an estimated 10 percent of its staff in the wake of COVID-19 according to sources. It named Kristin Walott formerly president as CEO succeeding longtime head David Suliteanu who has left the business. Kat Von D was renamed KVD Vegan Beauty in the wake of its separation from namesake Katherine von Drachenberg the tattoo shop owner turned reality star who sold her ownership shares in the makeup line early in the year. Bite Beauty went vegan and expanded its offer with a range of products for the complexion.

Like most prestige-weighted beauty players Chanel saw sales declines in all product categories with more resilience for its skin care business than other segments. All regions declined and travel retail was particularly negatively impacted by the halt in international travel.

Within fragrance two pillars scents Coco Mademoiselle and Bleu de Chanel resisted better than the rest of the portfolio. Gabrielle was boosted by the rollout of Gabrielle Essence in Asia; it launched in other regions in 2019. Classic fragrance No. 5 got a new face French actress Marion Cotillard. Coco Mademoiselle introduced L’Eau Privée reinterpreting the accord of the original fragrance especially for nighttime wear.

The company’s makeup business especially lip products were the most impacted by the crisis as consumers moved away from the category. Chanel expanded its Boy de Chanel makeup line for men and there were introductions for Les Beiges Essence de Teint a lightweight foundation with skin care benefits and Rouge Allure Laque a long-wearing lip color.

In skin care boosted by Asia in particular La Mousse continued to perform well as did the Sublimage and Le Lift franchises. Key launches for the year included Hydra Beauty Camellia Repair Mask Le Lift Night Cream and Sublimage l’Extrait de Nuit a night serum.

The company saw online sales grow strongly both on its own sites and retailer dot-com platforms. It introduced new e-commerce sites for Portugal Luxembourg and Austria.

On the retail front 20 new Chanel beauty boutiques opened during the year with a focus on Asia.

While local brands are doing roaring business in the mass market the high-margin luxury end is dominated by established European American and Japanese brands.

They are being aided by capital infusion from global investors and are teaming up with local authorities across the country to develop infrastructure and facilities to enhance research quality and innovation.

China’s cosmetics producers outsold by foreign luxury brands from L’Oreal Shiseido Estee Lauder and LVMH are strengthening their research and marketing efforts to build market share – and trust – among millennial consumers.

Turning the tide is likely to depend on winning the trust and loyalty of millennial consumers like Joanna Zhou those aged between 25 and 40 who account for more than a quarter of China’s population.

“Domestic firms in recent years have started to pay more attention to branding and enhancing standards” said Zhou who helps run her family business in Foshan Guangdong. “When there are no Chinese brands which are excellent enough I tend to choose more mature foreign brands to reduce risks. But I’m trying out domestic brands for facial cleansers facial creams lipsticks and cosmetic brushes.”

China’s beauty market comprising colour cosmetics and facial skincare was the largest in the world at US$38.8 billion in retail sales in 2019 according to Yatsen Holding citing China Insights Consultancy. Sales are projected to reach almost US$69 billion by 2025 it added.

Qianzhan Industry Research separately estimated retail sales in 2020 at 340 billion yuan (US$52.3 billion). The high-end luxury market is dominated by global brands such as La Mer from Estee Lauder Guerlain from LVMH and Helena Rubinstein from L’Oreal. Paris-based L’Oreal topped the market with more than a 15 per cent share it estimated.

Four of the top nine brands are products churned out from the factories of Shanghai Chimax Cosmetics Pechoin of Shanghai Pehchaolin Daily Chemical Jala Group and Shanghai-listed Shanghai Jahwa United according to Qianzhan.

China has one of the largest gen-z – those born in the mid-1990s – and millennial populations in the world with 171.4 million people in gen-z and 231.5 million millennials as of December 31 2019 according to Yatsen. These populations are 3.9 times and five times larger than the respective numbers in the US.

While gen-z and millennials represented less than 30 per cent of China’s population their consumption of beauty products accounted for almost 59 per cent of the country’s overall beauty product consumption which is expected to rise to 61.3 per cent by 2025 it added.

“In the next five to 10 years China will have one or two leading brands globally” said Leo Li principal at international management consultancy Roland Berger based in Shanghai. “When a market is large enough it will incubate local consumer brands and one of the key areas is cosmetics and skincare products.”

A number of cities in the country are aiming to become into the beauty capital of the world. Beauty industrial estates have sprouted in cities such as Guangzhou Shanghai and Changsha.

The industry contributes more than a fifth to the factory production of Fengxian district in Shanghai. The value generated by the district’s flagship “East Beauty Valley’’ project is expected to reach at least 100 billion yuan by 2025.

Companies in these parks are leveraging logistical support research and development incentives product and marketing innovation and branding to meet changing consumption trends among China’s younger generation.

Companies have also built up innovative marketing and sales approaches through e-commerce platforms and live streaming. Around 30 per cent of gen-z now purchase beauty care products online according to a research report by CBNData.

Guangzhou UNES Biotech which focuses on skin optimisation targeting people in their 20s and 30s sells almost all of its products online. The firm formed a 25-member live-streaming team in December which has now contributed 20 per cent of its sales.

“We want to enhance our brand exposure to consumers and increase market share” founder and chief executive Li Zhanhong said.

All this will require deep pockets to build market share said Li Daoyang general manager of Guangzhou Leekee Packaging which designs and manufactures packaging bottles for cosmetics brands. Some players have recently tapped the market for fresh capital.

Yatsen the Guangzhou-based owner of Perfect Diary brand raised US$617 million in November en route to its New York Stock Exchange listing. The stock has risen 11.4 per cent to US$11.70 through Friday. In Shenzhen Yunnan Botanee Bio-technology has rallied 373 per cent to 223.99 yuan since its March 25 debut.

“You could be undefeated before when you had a flagship [and popular] product. But now you have to harness the power [of] supply chain capital and sales models” said Guangzhou UNES Biotech’s Li. “It’s much more demanding than before in terms of your ability to integrate all these resources.”

How can I say this with such confidence? Just look at the performance of “Húsavík” the Eurovision song that earned a nomination for Best Original Song.

As a part of this year’s socially distanced Oscars ceremony the nominees for Best Original Song all performed before the actual show (an insulting choice but we’ll get to that later). “Húsavík” actually performed in the Icelandic town of Húsavík was easily the best of the bunch not just because it’s a great song but because singer Molly Sandén was joined by a chorus of children all dressed in perfectly Icelandic sweaters that have sent my friend group into an Etsy sweater-searching frenzy. It was cheesy sure but cheesy in the same way that the entire movie is i.e. unapologetically appealingly so. It was also nothing if not a show-stopper with Sandén and her tiny back-up singers framed by majestic boats and fireworks lighting up the skies in the song’s final moments. And when Sanden hit that high note? My word.

It feels like a crime that such a triumphant performance should be treated like an afterthought (pre-thought) rather than serve its true purpose as a highlight of a ceremony that otherwise seems to be primed for chaos. (Remember the Golden Globes?) The songs have regularly been high points during the Oscars ceremony—they’re assured to be better than the banter and bits that hosts often try to make work between awards—and “Húsavík” is particularly great. I admit that I began crying as soon as the choir of children began singing—maybe that makes me an easy mark but all of Eurovision does nothing if not tug on the heartstrings and I love it for that.

Of course it’s also particularly heartwarming as the culmination of the actual town of Húsavík’s campaign to bring home an Oscar “An Óskar for Húsavík” which is perhaps the cutest For Your Consideration campaign since that time David Lynch just sat by the side of the road with a live cow and a giant poster touting Laura Dern’s performance in Inland Empire. Then again David Lynch didn’t have an adorable gaggle of children singing like angels so I’d say Eurovision has the high ground.

By Dodge’s own admittance this new version of the Durango is for “Muscle Car People With Families.” The Hellcat features some awesome new exterior styling a new driver-centric interior and of course let us not forget the 710 horsepower that comes with it.

To be honest who would not want an SUV that can produce the kind of power that the new Durango has? As we found after a week behind the wheel it is a whole lot of fun and excitement to motor around in not to mention the looks we got having a Hellcat in the family for the week!

Sad thing is that Dodge is set to build the SRT version of the Durango for one year only in 2021. So if an over-the-top SUV is anywhere in your wheelhouse now it the time to act as they will go fast at the dealers. In fact we had the opportunity to stop in at Doug Smith in Spanish Fork and they have two on order that were actually sold before they have even arrived.

Even through the new SRT Durango is the most powerful SUV ever it was still very sophisticated and a great everyday driver. We even had the chance to take a ride out to Delta on the Saturday of our test week to attend the Snow Geese Festival taking along Pat Craig’s mother and our daughter Sadie in the back seats.

They were perfectly comfortable in the rear seats and with the added rear seat heaters made the 90-minute drive even better. Sadie was even able to take advantage of the kid-friendly DVD player and watch a movie on her screen on the way home.

This ride turned out to be very unique attending a festival we didn’t even know existed. It was something we had found out about from the Department of Wildlife Services and we figured it was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.

There were literally thousands of snow geese on Gunnison Reservoir about 5 miles west of Delta that come every year on their annual trek northward to Canada for the summer. It was worth the trip to see them all especially when they all took off and moved to the top of the reservoir in the afternoon.

They actually looked like a small snow island in the middle of the reservoir that afternoon. The chamber of commerce even had a trailer there selling hamburgers and one selling T-shirts for those who braved the drive to Delta.

Our rear seat folks were more than happy to enjoy the ride except the time that Craig may have accelerated too quickly onto the freeway on our way home.

Beyond the fact that this was a really fast ride there are many other reasons to look at the new Durango as it proved after a week to be a great family ride and even a wonderful everyday driver.

The amount of space is perfect in the back as we found on a trip to Costco. With the rear seats down it was super easy to load and unload everything we picked up. The third row would be great for kids but adults would struggle over the long haul.

Having captain’s chairs in the back proved to be a bonus as we found with two adults on our outing. They seemed to fit them very nicely and made accessing the third row easier. A larger family however may want to go for a bench seat on the second row adding an extra space to sit.

The new 10.1-inch screen that sat front and center on the dashboard now includes the new Uconnect 5 system that features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We loved this new feature as it connected to our phones automatically every time we got in to go for a drive.

The screen appears almost exactly as our home screen would on our iPhones and was super easy to use with Siri even reading our texts and taking voice commands to run things. We were even able to hook up two phones at the same time receiving calls on either.

Of course being the Hellcat version of the Durango there were also all kinds of performance pages and apps included in the new system which proved to be very entertaining especially the timers that would keep track of any sprints to 60 100 or even our top speed if we wanted.

On the safety side our test ride came fully equipped with all the great features we love. These include blind spot monitoring rear cross path detection front and rear parking assist forward emergency braking and our favorite adaptive cruise control with a lane keep assist.

Gas mileage however should not be a real consideration with this Durango as we managed only 12.3 mpg for the week. But we did get that up from the 10.9 it was getting when it arrived; the long trip to Delta really helped with that.

For the ultimate family hauler that every dad and maybe even mom is going to love the new 2021 Durango Hellcat really should fit the bill. Most importantly everyone will recognize you as having what is most likely the fastest vehicle in the neighborhood!

And a new wave of multi-passenger electric bikes are opening the door for two-up riding that hasn’t typically been possible on unassisted pedal bikes.

Sure you could carry a friend on your pedal bike’s rear rack or perhaps plop your girlfriend down on the handlebars of your cruiser. But good luck powering the two of you up a hill on leg power alone.

With utility and moped style electric bikes though the extra weight (and space) of a passenger is no problem.

Of course this requires a fairly high power motor meaning you won’t be running a moto taxi service on your Specialized electric road bike. But higher power electric bikes such as electric cargo bikes utility bikes and e-mopeds are now making it a breeze to ditch your car for a bike and still carry a passenger (or two!) around with you.

Super73 just added new 2-up seats to the company’s lineup converting their popular S1 S2 and R-Series electric bicycles from one-seaters to two-seaters.

To carry a passenger comfortably you’ll want to add a pair of rear foot pegs – or find an e-bike that comes with them pre-installed.

When I reviewed the dual motor Ariel Rider D-Class e-bike I carried my nephews around on the long bench seat and included foot pegs. Back then the foot pegs were a little weak looking but the company responded by upgrading to massive cast iron folding pegs on their new models that look like they could support a circus bear.

Both the Ariel Rider X-Class and new Grizzly models offer these big rear foot pegs and the Grizzly even has dual motors plus dual batteries to give you extra power and range for flying up hills with a passenger on board.

While the Grizzly is a bit steeper at $2999 (though worth it for the high power dual motors and dual batteries) the entry-level X-Class gets you rolling with passenger pegs for a cool $1599 though you’ll want to upgrade to the $89 two-person seat to make the most of those chunky rear foot pegs. Even so for under $1700 you’ve got a crazy powerful full-suspension electric bike capable of carrying two passengers – that’s a lot of utility!

Other famous moped-style e-bikes like those from Juiced Bikes also make it easy to carry passengers though not right out of the box like the Ariel Rider bikes above.

The Juiced Scorpion X HyperScorpion and HyperScrambler 2 models all come with foot peg attachment points on the rear swingarm. For $39 you can add foot pegs to carry a rear passenger.

The HyperScrambler 2 comes with a long bench seat perfect for two riders while the Scorpion series can be upgraded to a longer bench seat. Out of the box the Scorpion e-bikes have a shorter single-passenger seat that leaves room for the utility rack behind the rider.

But it’s not only moped-style e-bikes that are offering the ability to ride 2-up. Electric cargo bikes and utility bikes are also getting in on the action.

Tern’s Team Captain Josh Hon once took me for a spin on the rather unassuming looking Tern GSD e-bike showing me how the throttle-less electric bike had no problem ferrying two adults around. Technically the carrier on the rear was designed for kids as evidenced by its guards to keep kids from falling off but it held me just fine.

Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes has a pair of passenger-ready e-bikes in its line up.

The $1299 RadRunner electric utility bike has a passenger package option that adds a long padded bench seat foot pegs and a rear wheel skirt to make sure no calves or feet find their way into the wheel spokes.

I’ve personally used the RadRunner to carry my two nephews around turning the RadRunner into a three-person e-bike. But with two adults my brother and I have gone 2-up on the bike showing how it easily carries over 350 lb (160 kg) of riders.

For a bit more space the $1899 RadWagon electric cargo bike provides the option for an even longer rear bench seat either foot pegs or running boards and a deck hand accessory that gives the rear passenger a large grab handle to hold on to.

The increasing number of passenger-enabled electric bikes serves to further underscore the extreme utility and versatility of e-bikes.

While some models are designed for fitness and others for recreation e-bikes that can carry passengers make it that much easier for commuters to ditch their cars and save money with an electric bicycle.

Electric cargo and utility e-bikes might not be able to completely replace a minivan but they sure can help replace many of the same trips that many people perform with cars.

And as e-bike adoption rates continue to climb we’re all but certain to see more interesting utility offerings in the space.",,,

This comes after the company and the United Steelworkers failed to reach an agreement Friday for a new contract after weeks of negotiations.

According to ExxonMobil the lockout will begin next Saturday.

That means Exxon Mobil will not let employees who are union members enter the Beaumont plant if an agreement is not reached before then.

In a statement the company said “ExxonMobil has been actively engaged in good faith negotiations with the United Steelworkers. We have made extensive efforts to reach an agreement the union committee has not allowed employees to vote on our offer. We hope this situation will be resolved promptly.”



KFDM/FOX 4 News Jillian Fertig also reached out to the United Steelworkers but the president of the local union says the union leadership chooses not to discuss negotiations with the media at this time.

USW Local 13-243 President Darrell Kyle told KFDM/FOX 4's Jillian Fertig in an email Monday that ""we do not negotiate in the news media because our issues are very complex. We appreciate you contacting us for an update but the USW Local 13-243 leadership elects not to discuss negotiations with the company at this time in the media.""

KFDM/FOX 4 reached out to the USW a second time on Saturday for comment following the lock-out notice but did not receive a response.

According to a statement issued by the coalition the meeting was attended by President of Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) Alistair Routledge; Production Manager Mike Ryan Public and Government Affairs Advisor Janelle Persaud by Opposition Leader Joseph Harmon Members of Parliament Khemraj Ramjattan Amanza Walton-Desir David Patterson Geeta Chandan-Edmond Ronald Cox Roysdale Forde and Executive Director of the Office of the Leader of the Opposition Aubrey Norton.

It was noted by the coalition that the significant scaling down of operations which was described as a base level of 30000 barrels per day is of considerable concern given the impact it would have on Guyana’s earnings from the industry.

“We have been bombarded with questions and concerns from the public and our supporters and therefore took the opportunity to engage with Exxon to benefit from their direct explanations and to inform them of our position on the issues. At the heart of the issue is the flaring of gas into the atmosphere and the operational efficiency of critical equipment. We informed ExxonMobil that we are resolutely against flaring; except when permitted at pilot light level. We inquired whether the people of Guyana will have to bear the cost associated with the malfunctioning equipment” the statement informed.

Harmon stated that they are insisting that the issues be treated as a matter of urgency so production can be safely returned to optimum levels. It was noted that while seeking to exploit the country’s natural resources it is important to maintain a strong commitment to doing so within a green framework with minimal effects to the environment on land sea and with respect to the country’s laws.

Since January this year ExxonMobil has experienced major problems with the gas compression equipment on its Liza Destiny Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) platform in the Atlantic and this has led to environmentally damaging gas flaring which is now set to continue.

In addition the issue regarding ExxonMobil’s involvement on the gas to shore project was raised and a commitment was made to present a detailed presentation of all the matters on a later date.

“Overall I am satisfied with the tone and content of the meeting both Mr. Routledge and both sides expressed a strong desire to engage on a more regular basis. This was the first in what I anticipate to be a series of ongoing meetings. I would like to thank Mr. Routledge and his team for meeting with us and for the information and assurances which they provided” Harmon was quoted as saying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vYWxsdG9nZXRoZXIuc3dlLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA0L2FzaWFuLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFuZC1wYWNpZmljLWlzbGFuZGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month - All Together,"This May we are recognizing incredible SWE members from the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and the other individuals who have inspired their own careers in STEM. Each of the featured women is a member of the Asian Connections Affinity Group (ACAG) one of many affinity groups within SWE.

Margaret Omori — ACAG Vice Lead

Margaret grew up in Evanston Illinois just a block away from the house where her dad grew up. Margaret has a lot of family in the Chicago area and was lucky to have a strong support system nearby who encouraged her to pursue her love of STEM from a young age. Some of her earliest memories include building rockets in the park with her dad and creating LEGO cities with her older brother. As Margaret progressed through high school her favorite classes were math chemistry and physics which inspired her to study Chemical Engineering at Yale University. Today Margaret is a Project Manager at ExxonMobil for environmental remediation projects based out of Brooklyn New York. She loves being able to use her problem-solving and quantitative reasoning skills from her engineering degree in her day job. In her free time Margaret still loves building LEGO creations—it’s a wonderful hobby that blends art with STEM. She is also an avid reader and a Peloton enthusiast.

As an Asian-American woman in a white male-dominated industry having AAPI women role models has been crucial to her professional development. In particular Margaret’s first Team Lead at ExxonMobil Chui Mei Cheung inspired her at a critical point in her career. Transitioning from school—where her success was based on grades and academic achievements—to the workplace—where success can be much more nebulous—was difficult. It seemed like there was a mysterious path to success that she didn’t understand. Having an Asian-American woman in a leadership position to look up to helped Margaret navigate this new uncharted territory. This leader mentored Margaret on how to communicate effectively advocate for herself and her ideas and influence without authority. Seeing the business accomplishments this leader had achieved helped Margaret believe that a position in leadership could be possible in her future too. Margaret feels lucky to have found such a mentor and she hopes that the ACAG can help connect more mentors and mentees going forward.

Kristine Loh — ACAG Community Lead

Kristine Loh (she/her) is a first-year Chemical Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities. She is a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and a College of Science and Engineering Fellow. As a member of the Ferry and Kortshagen Lab Groups her research focuses on luminescent nanoparticles for solar windows on greenhouses. She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering and her M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Drexel University in 2020 where she was heavily involved in undergraduate research and the Drexel SWE section. She pursued chemical engineering in college because she took pre-engineering classes in high school where she first learned about manufacturing and realized for the first time that she could actually see herself as an engineer. Kristine was born and raised in a town near Miami Florida and in her free time she enjoys experimenting with her air fryer trying out new restaurants and volunteering at K-12 STEM engagement events. Someone who inspires her is Dr. Jayshree Seth who also studied chemical engineering and has made great strides in creating inclusive environments for women in STEM.

Kalyani Mallela—SWE Board of Directors Member

Kalyani Mallela was born in India where she grew up surrounded by engineers. At a young age she developed a keen understanding of all the ways an engineer can impact the world and it became obvious: she would be an engineer. Inspired and supported by her parents she earned her B.S. in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Osmania University in India. She then moved to the Twin Cities where she received her M.S. in Management of Technology and Electrical Engineering both from the University of Minnesota.

Kalyani is currently a Director of Research and Development (R&D) for Ethicon part of the Johnson & Johnson Medical Device companies. As a leader in the Robotics and Digital Solutions group she owns instrument development providing solutions to improve outcomes across a broad range of disease states.

She shares her experiences as an engineering student and professional hoping to inspire girls to pursue technical opportunities. Kalyani is an active SWE member and has served as a Section President Senator Awards & Recognition Committee Chair and Society Nominating Committee member. She currently serves as a Director on the SWE Board of Directors.

Kalyani derives inspiration from Sudha Murty known for her grassroots work serving the under-privileged across India. Sudha’s social work has covered healthcare education women empowerment public hygiene rural development art and culture and poverty alleviation. Sudha was the first female engineering student at her college and the first female engineer hired at India’s largest automotive manufacturer. Sudha is known for the quote “Philanthropy has nothing to do with money. It’s a warm hug a kind word…that can change lives. It’s about helping fellow human beings.” Through her life Sudha has shown us that there is always help you can offer humankind even without access to money. Kalyani believes that Sudha is a woman to admire thank and strive to be more like.

With a range of more than 200 km the E-Ducato is well-suited for last mile logistics. In line with the recently launched Sustainability Roadmap of DPDHL Group DHL Express plans to have more than 14000 electric vans in operation in Europe by 2030 to reduce their carbon emissions.





In Europe DHL Express connects consumers and businesses in more than 60 countries and territories relying on a pickup and delivery fleet that consists of around 500 electric vans mainly operating in urban regions and 14000 non-electric vehicles today. Due to the high customer demand for international Express deliveries the company expects its European last-mile fleet growing to approximately 20000 vans by 2030.

To transform its sustainability strategy into reality the company is strongly committed that 60% of its fleet operate electric by end of the current decade (approximately 14000 vehicles).

A majority are large vans used for urban and metropolitan deliveries. Together with Fiat Professional the E-Ducato was trialed through tests under different real-world operating conditions such as very low temperatures extreme slopes and long distances to check its response to the whole range of DHL usage patterns.





In addition to the vehicles itself a totally electric mobility chain needs comprehensive area-wide charging infrastructure. To enable a further expansion of its charging network DHL Express is currently working in collaboration with several specialized companies on a roadmap to significantly increase the number of charging points across Europe within the next years.

The electrification of last mile logistics is one of the main pillars of DPDHL Group’s recently announced Sustainability roadmap. The Group is investing a total of €7 billion (Opex and Capex) by 2030 in measures to reduce its CO 2 emissions. In addition to the electrification of the vehicles the funds will go in particular towards sustainable aviation fuels and climate-neutral buildings.

E-Ducato. The E-Ducato can achieve equivalent performance to diesel versions using an electric motor with maximum torque of 280 N·m and delivering up to 90 kW of power (approximately 122 hp); 0-50 km/h acceleration takes 5 seconds.

The E-Ducato is also fitted out with a series of modular solutions starting from 2 different battery blocks—47 kWh and 79 kWh—and 4 types of charging modes 3 of which are available at launch. With a 47-kWh battery the E-Ducato can travel up to 170 km (106 miles) in the WLTP cycle and up to 235 km (146 miles) in the urban cycle. With a 79-kWh battery the distances increase to 280 km (174 miles) in the WLTP cycle equivalent to 370 km (230 miles) in the urban cycle. It takes no longer than half an hour to charge up enough to drive 100 km.

The batteries have a warranty for 10 years or 220000 km on the 79-kWh version or 8 years/160000 km on the 47-kWh model.

To meet a wide and diverse range of needs the E-Ducato offers the Drive Mode Selector: in “Normal” position it ensures an optimal balance between performance and costs or it can be set to “Eco” mode to save energy. When a really heavy load needs to be carried or the vehicle is facing a demanding ascent the right choice is “Power” mode. E-Ducato has another two features to provide drivers with safeguard drivers’ peace of mind:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3RoZXdlc3QuY29tLmF1L2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9uYXRoYW4tZmF5LWV4aXRzLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtYXVzdHJhbGlhLXRlbnVyZS1hZnRlci10d2lzdC1vZi10aGUtZ2FzLXRhcC1hdC13ZXN0LWJhcnJhY291dGEtbmctYjg4MTg1NjEzNXrSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGV3ZXN0LmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy9lbmVyZ3kvbmF0aGFuLWZheS1leGl0cy1leHhvbm1vYmlsLWF1c3RyYWxpYS10ZW51cmUtYWZ0ZXItdHdpc3Qtb2YtdGhlLWdhcy10YXAtYXQtd2VzdC1iYXJyYWNvdXRhLW5nLWI4ODE4NTYxMzV6LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nathan Fay exits ExxonMobil Australia tenure after twist of the gas tap at West Barracouta,"ExxonMobil Australia chairman Nathan Fay is winding up his two-year stint Down Under on a high after turning on the taps for the energy giant’s West Barracouta offshore project in the Gippsland Basin.

Mr Fay who will head back to headquarters in Texas next month said West Barracouta would be the biggest new source of domestic gas supply the Australian market had seen this decade.

“There is always a huge uplift when you open those valves and you see all of that hard work and effort and those hardships translate into a finished product and gas flowing” Mr Fay told The Australian.

“It’s not always as visible as flow streaming through a pipe but for people to see the response in the control rooms it’s incredible.”

TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics business culture and opinion. READ NOW

West Barracouta was one of the largest proven undeveloped gas fields off the south-eastern Australian coast. Following a $400 million investment it will now deliver much-needed gas supplies to help curb the potential gas shortfalls predicted for Australia’s southern and Eastern States as early as 2023.

The feat is considered even more incredible given ExxonMobil had to drill two wells and install the subsea infrastructure during the pandemic with restrictions around staff movements to keep a lid on the spread of COVID-19.

“During COVID-19 we made a lot of changes to make sure there was no cross-contamination of people between infrastructure so effectively setting up a bubble around a drilling rig” Mr Fay said.

“And asking people to extend modify shift patterns — people perhaps being able to have less flexibility on travelling backwards and forwards between home and the workplace — it’s a tough ask for a lot of people.”

Dylan Pugh the former general manager of US Conventional at ExxonMobil will replace Mr Fay at the helm.

Mr Fay will take up a post as vice-president acquisitions and divestments for ExxonMobil in Texas."

Zhao who helmed the poetic magic-hour-draped drama Nomadland is only the second woman to ever win the category.

She began her speech by thanking the Academy as well as her fellow nominees Emerald Fennell David Fincher Lee Isaac Chung and Thomas Vinterberg.

“I’ve been thinking a lot lately of how I keep going when things get hard and I think it goes back to something I learned when I was a kid” Zhao said. She recounted one of her childhood pastimes recalling how she and her father used to play a game memorizing classic Chinese poems then recite them to each other and try to finish each other’s sentences. One of her favorites translated into English went like this: “People at birth are inherently good.”

“Those six letters had such a great impact on me when I was a kid and I still truly believe them today even though sometimes it may seem like the opposite is true” Zhao said. “This is for anyone who had the faith and courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves. And to hold on to the goodness in each other…this is for you. You inspire me to keep going. Thank you. Thank you.”

Zhao is only the second woman to win the best-director statuette following Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker. Nomadland was an early favorite in the awards race celebrated on the festival circuit for its rugged naturalistic portrayal of the American West. The film based on the eponymous nonfiction book by Jessica Bruder stars Frances McDormand as Fern a nomadic woman living out of her van working a series of odd jobs out on the road. The film was nominated for six Oscars overall including best actress and best picture.

The Mitigated Negative Declaration document shows three low-density residences replaced by an 11-story condominium building as part of the Santana Row/Valley Fair Urban Village. The project developer is Cord Associates.

Carpira Design Group is the project architect. The renderings show a thin extended shape with a cubic beehive of framed windows with alternating planters as decoration. The facade will be composed of stucco white sand with wood panels white concrete and architectural glazing. 60 new trees will be added across the project.

The structure will rise 120 feet above street level to create 79 apartments and 9820 square feet of commercial space across the ground and second level of the building. Unit sizes will vary with 34 one-bedroom units 41 two-bedroom units and four three-bedroom units. The residential lobby will be found along Hemlock Avenue while commercial access will be created along with Hemlock Baywood and Redwood Avenue.

Below-grade parking will be included for 98 cars. The property will also have the capacity for 26 motorcycles and 37 bicycles.

The developers had previously wished to build a 105-room hotel at 375 South Baywood Avenue. Though the hotel was approved in 2018 the developer changed the application to mixed-use residential use after acquiring 382 South Redwood Avenue to expand the property area to 0.44 acres.

Developers are expecting the project to be fully entitled by June of 2021. Cord Associates acquired the property in 2020. Construction is expected to last 20 month from demolition to opening.

375 South Baywood Avenue will rise across from another project by the Cord Associates and Carpira Design Group a six-story mixed-use project at 2881 Hemlock Avenue. The proposal calls for 48 condominiums and 19130 square feet for retail.

Judge James Moody Jr. has also ruled that Jason Kranz Christopher Day Angela Kranz Nanette Elliott Angie Taylor and KD Premier Realty are enjoined from doing business as real estate brokers or agents in The Villages for a period of 18-months beginning June 1.

The ruling was announced Friday after a five-day trial earlier this month in federal court in Tampa.

It is a major victory for The Villages which claimed the former sales representatives were in violation of independent contractor agreements that included non-compete clauses. The judge also denied the former sales representatives’ claims that they were owed overtime compensation. They had argued they were treated more like employees than independent contractors.

Day and Kranz sent bombshell emails to the entire Properties of The Villages sales force on Dec. 16 2019 announcing their abrupt departure from the powerful sales arm of Florida’s Friendliest Hometown. When Vice President of Sales Jennifer Parr took the witness stand earlier this month she admitted she had been caught off guard by the sudden departure of two of her top salesmen both of whom were earning in the neighborhood of $500000 per year according to their own testimony.

Day and Kranz admitted they had taken customer lists and other information when they left Properties of The Villages but both downplayed it and said what they took was out of date and not valuable. The judge has ordered them to return the information to Properties of The Villages by June 1. But he also gave them until June 1 as “a wind down period” to cease their real estate activities in The Villages.

The judge also ruled that information contained in Properties of The Villages computer system the AS/400 constitutes a trade secret.

“It is a compilation program and process that derives independent economic value not readily ascertained by outside persons and created by efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. It contains valuable confidential business information about POV’s customers and constitutes customer goodwill concerning a specific geographic location trademark and extraordinary specialized training. POV maintains this information to follow its customers. Buyers of homes in The Villages buy multiple times. By treating them as lifelong customers POV has retained 55 percent of the re-sale market” the judge wrote in the decision.

Properties of The Villages had hired high-powered litigator John Lauro whose legal expertise has been called upon for on-air appearances on Fox News. Lauro shredded Day and Kranz on the stand unearthing everything from an embarrassing frat-boy scrape with the law to a devastating bankruptcy. He also picked at possible marital miscommunication between Jason and Angela Kranz forcing the admission that Mrs. Kranz was not fully in the loop before the Dec. 16 2019 point-of-no-return email was sent by her husband. Angela Kranz said she had hoped to maintain her position at Properties of The Villages where she earned $130000 in her second year as a sales representative while her husband birthed his new competing business.

Lauro also came to court armed with numerous exhibits including several email messages from Day and Kranz in which they praised Parr her family’s vision and told of how fortunate they felt to be a “cog in the wheel” of The Villages.

The judge offered a formula for the amount of damages awarded to Properties of The Villages.

“POV placed into evidence a list of sales made by Defendants since leaving. It removed the three properties owned individually by a Defendant and calculated the lost commissions. That amount was multiplied by POV’s 55 percent market share of home re-sales giving a resulting total of $603700.36. The Court concludes that is an appropriate measure of damages” wrote Judge Moody who is the father of Attorney General Ashley Moody.

Lauro had claimed The Villages suffered $1.12 million in lost commissions due to KD Premier Realty.

Day Kranz and the others who left Properties of The Villages to join the rebel real estate firm were represented by attorney Jonathan Pollard of Fort Lauderdale. Former Properties of The Villages sales representative Cynthia Hughes settled in the case days before the trial. She agreed to pay Properties of The Villages $5000 for its attorneys’ fees. Former salesperson Kelly Shipes also settled before the trial started. She did not pay any attorneys’ fees but like Hughes agreed not to sell real estate in The Villages for 18 months. Both Hughes and Shipes had followed Day and Kranz to KD Premier Realty.",,,,,,,,,

The leader of the Indianapolis police union said Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears “failed to do his part” when he chose not to bring Brandon Scott Hole before a judge for a hearing under Indiana’s “red flag” law even after his mother called police last year to say her son might pursue “suicide by cop.”

“Unfortunately the lack of action by the Marion County prosecutor prevented a court hearing which could have … prohibited the suspect from owning … any other firearms” Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder said. “Why didn’t the prosecutor seek the hearing that the statute requires? Why didn’t the prosecutor use all the legal tools available? Why didn’t the prosecutor try?”

The law allows police to confiscate guns from a person deemed dangerous to themselves or others. Prosecutors can then decide whether to ask a court to ban that person from buying any other firearms.

The law came under scrutiny following the assault after Mears criticized it for having too many “loopholes.” Despite calls from Democratic lawmakers’ to review and strengthen the red flag provisions those actions were put on hold. The 2021 legislative session ended Thursday.

Police seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole then 18 in March 2020 after they received the call from his mother. Mears said Monday that prosecutors did not seek a “red flag” hearing to try to prevent Hole from possessing a gun because they did not have enough time under the law to definitively demonstrate his propensity for suicidal thoughts.

Mears specifically pointed to a 2019 change in the law that requires courts to make a “good-faith effort” to hold a hearing within 14 days. An additional amendment requires authorities to file an affidavit with the court within 48 hours.

“This individual was taken and treated by medical professionals and he was cut loose” and was not even prescribed any medication Mears said. “The risk is if we move forward with that (red flag) process and lose we have to give that firearm back to that person. That’s not something we were willing to do.”

Indianapolis police previously said that they never returned that shotgun to Hole. Authorities have said he used two “assault-style” rifles to gun down eight people four of them from the city’s Sikh community at the FedEx facility on April 15 before he killed himself.

Members and leaders of the Sikh community have demanded that law enforcement conduct a “thorough” and “transparent” investigation including a probe into the possibility of bias as Hole’s motivation said Satjeet Kaur Executive Director of the Sikh Coalition. Those calls have so far avoided direct criticism of Mears however.

“If it is determined that there was a failure in this law that could have prevented this tragedy from happening the law should be fixed” Kaur said. “If the law was incorrectly implemented as written the parties responsible must be held accountable.”

Republican state Sen. Erin Houchin who sponsored the 2019 changes to Indiana’s red flag law said it “could have worked just as it should” in the Hole case.

“I think that had the prosecutor followed the red flag procedure in this case then this 19-year-old might have not been able to purchase a second firearm after the family did voluntarily turn over that weapon” Houchin said.

Mears did not return messages Friday seeking additional comment.

Indiana law does not mandate prosecutors to pursue court hearings in red flag law cases. Houchin said she would consider amending language to “firm up” that process but only after more facts surrounding the shooting come to light.

Snyder said the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has made at least 45 red flag referrals to the prosecutor’s office so far this year. Mears said Monday that his office had filed eight red flag petitions since January. All are still awaiting rulings.

“The prosecutor appears to have raised the suggestion that the system failed but I would point out that in this instance the system didn’t fail” Synder said. “A loophole did not thwart this opportunity instead the process was sidestepped.”

More than 100 people gathered at The Blended Church on the west side of Indianapolis. Guests were greeted with ribbons and a ""celebration of life"" booklet with pictures and notes to Smith chronicling her ""deep love and affection"" for her siblings and ""go-getter attitude."" Her grandma wrote about how she still wears an engraved bracelet crafted by Smith.

At least 35 people — including Smith's mother Karen Smith — wore pink and black t-shirts showing the 19-year-old's smiling face. A flower display spelling her name was also pink chosen because it was the color of Smith's softball team's jerseys.

""She was such a wonderful little girl"" Karen Smith said. ""Everybody fell in love with her. Even people that just met her ... she was so much fun. She was always smiling. She just wanted to be everybody's friend.""

Who was Karli Smith? 19-year-old one of eight people killed in FedEx shooting

A steady stream of those people came to say their goodbyes and comfort Karen Smith: friends throughout Karli Smith's school years softball teammates former co-workers even new co-workers from her FedEx job where Karli Smith had only been working for two weeks.

""Everywhere that she pretty much has left her mark"" she said ""they came out and showed respect.""

Those loved ones leaned on each other Saturday. Guests greeted one another with hugs and tears. A slideshow displayed pictures and videos of Smith hanging out with friends and dancing. ""Aw"" someone in the crowd exclaimed while watching one of the videos.

""We love you"" one of the captions said. ""LLK forever"" meaning Long Live Karli forever read another.

'There's just no tears left'

Family members reflected on the sudden loss and remembered the vivacity of Smith's personality.

Jeffrey Smith Jr. was married to Karen Smith 20 years ago but their families remain close. He decorated his new Chevrolet truck with pictures of Karli Smith and the words ""Luv ya Baby Girl."" He had heard about Smith's death just one hour after buying the new truck.

""Kind of a stain but make the best of what you got you know?"" Smith Jr. said.

His son Jeffrey Smith III wore a custom t-shirt and — at age 17 — is just two years younger than Smith. She's gone too early he said.

""There's just no tears left"" Smith III said. ""There's nothing in this world that can bring her back.

""Me and Karli were always just goofy telling jokes laughing at each other ... Karli was really special and she helped me with math homework often.""

Others reflected on watching Karli Smith grow up.

""She was the sweetest little kid ever"" said Jett Hughes a family friend.

""Outgoing that's the biggest word"" said Zoie Bailey another family friend. ""She was always funny. Never sad. She always she just wanted to make people laugh and just she always had a group around her. She loved people. She was just such a people person.""

Saturday showed that the people loved her back. The t-shirts the hugs the conversations about her daughter all helped get her through the day Karen Smith said but the final goodbye was — and is — the hardest part.

""I will literally never hear my daughter walk in the room and say 'Yo where's my beautiful mama?' And it hurts"" Karen Smith said. ""As soon as she walked through the door she'd look for me. It's hard to know that this was the final everything.""

""I had to tuck my baby in like I did when she was a baby. I shouldn't have to say goodbye to her. And I hate that I did.""

A celebration of life in honor of Karli Smith is scheduled for Sunday at the Daniel Webster School 46 from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Contreras

Indianapolis Star

One week after the deadliest mass shooting in Indianapolis’ recent history Sundeep Singh looked at the photos of four members of his community who were killed.

It hurts.

“That could have been my grandmother my grandfather my mother father my friends” the 24-year-old told IndyStar. “My own grandparents work at a factory. Our grandparents sacrificed a lot to come to this country and to give us the American Dream.”

Singh and members of the Sikh Coalition and Sikh United groups during a vigil Thursday at the Greenwood Amphitheater demanded accountability and answers from FedEx law enforcement and elected officials for the victims’ families and the survivors.

“This can’t be something that happens and we move on a month later” Singh said. “We’ll keep pushing authorities to keep investigating; we need details. And most importantly we need to know if FedEx holds merchandise as more valuable than human life.”

About 50 people gathered at the community amphitheater to pray and remember the eight victims.

Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers Greenwood council president Michael Campbell Greenwood council member Mike Williams Greenwood Chief of Police James Ison and State Rep. Michelle Davis also attended the vigil.

Myers said about 1000 Sikh Hoosiers live and work in Greenwood. An estimated 5000 Sikhs live in Central Indiana and 10000 in the state.

Sixty-eight-year-old Jaswinder Singh who was killed in the shooting was a resident he said.

“Your brother was taken senselessly” Myers said. “And this violence must stop. Sikhs promote kindness peace and love through our community and this is what we need more of in our community and our country.”

The motive of the shooting is still under investigation. But a 2020 Indianapolis Metropolitan police report showed the 19-year-old suspect viewed white supremacist websites a year ago. FBI Indianapolis Special officials on April 16 said the agency interviewed Hole in April 2020 regarding the incident but detected no “Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology” at the time.

The Sikh Coalition has since written letters demanding a full investigation on the motive of the shooting. The letters were sent to the FBI IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor Indiana’s entire congressional delegation Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb Indiana’s entire state legislature and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett.

The rampage last week is the worst attack on Sikh Americans and immigrants since 2012 when a gunman opened fire at Wisconsin Sikh temple killing six Sikhs and injuring several others.

Sikh Americans have experienced xenophobic violence for years; the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 2001 resulted in harassment and hate crimes that continue today.

“Sikhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world and yet nobody knows about us” Sundeep Singh said. “We need internal change. Make Sikhism a religion that is taught in schools allow us to wear our turbans our Kirpans inside airports inside government buildings.

“Otherwise you’re showing us as a threat” he said.

Sikh Coalition member Inderpreet Kaur said the group will help the Sikh community in Indianapolis with legal assistance interpretation services and mental health resources.

“I firmly believe that our connection the bond of our community is what will help us heal” Kaur said. “That bond will help us to act to prevent another tragedy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L2NvcC1iaWctcmlwcy1pbmRpYW5hcG9saXMtcHJvc2VjdXRvci1mb3Itbm90LXJlZC1mbGFnZ2luZy1icmFuZG9uLWhvbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cop big rips Indianapolis prosecutor for not 'red flagging' Brandon Hole,"The head of the union for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is lashing out at an Indiana prosecutor he says failed to use the state’s “red flag” gun law against the alleged FedEx shooter.

Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears has admitted his office declined to pursue a competency hearing against Brandon Hole 19 last year as allowed under the gun law.

Such a hearing could have been held when a shotgun was seized from Hole last year after his mother told cops she feared he wanted to commit suicide by cop officials said.

The lack of hearing cleared the way for Hole to legally purchase the two weapons he used in the massacre the police union head is complaining according to local station WLKY.

The FedEx massacre left eight people dead.

“Why didn’t the prosecutor seek the hearing that the statute requires? Why didn’t the prosecutor use all the legal tools available? Why didn’t the prosecutor try?” said Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder who added that Mears “failed to do his part.”

Under the law prosecutors would have had to bring their case against Hole to a judge within 14 days and convince them Hole had a “high propensity for violence.”

If they failed Hole would have gotten the gun back.

“In this particular situation we had a case where it was just a single incident there weren’t any other incidents reported to us the firearm was taken from the home there was an agreement that firearm wouldn’t be returned” Mears said.

Indiana Republican state Sen. Erin Houchin told WLKY the law “could have worked just as it should” in the case of the eventual FedEx shooter.

“I think that had the prosecutor followed the red flag procedure in this case then this 19-year-old might have not been able to purchase a second firearm after the family did voluntarily turn over that weapon” Houchin said."

Josh Bauer Aiden McFadden Chris Allan Darwin Matheus and Alex Garuba all made their ATL UTD 2 debuts.





Academy goalkeeper Vicente Reyes was called on early in the match as he made all four of his saves in the first half. After a comfortable save in the third minute the 17-year-old Reyes was forced into action again when Bauer nearly turned the ball in for an own goal. Louisville City took a free kick from the left side of the 18-yard-box that was floated to the back post. It deflected off Bauer and forced Reyes into a diving save to his right before being cleared away.





Coleman Gannon nearly put Atlanta ahead when he led a breakaway in the 29th minute. Gannon drove the ball down the middle of the field before peeling off towards the left where he was able to put a shot on goal but Chris Hubbard reacted quickly and made a kick save.





Louisville took the lead in the 69th minute. Oscar Jimenez delivered a corner kick from the left side where DelPiccolo was able to head the ball in from close range.





Pushing for an equalizer ATL UTD 2 appeared to have drawn a penalty in the 82nd minute. Phillip Goodrum played McFadden down the right side and into box where Cameron Lancaster took McFadden down from behind but there was no call on the play. Five minutes later Louisville extended its lead again through DelPiccolo. The Louisville captain netted his second of the night when he tapped in a cross from inside the six-yard box.

The district held a ribbon cutting and live demonstration Wednesday afternoon to commemorate the new Sustainable Outdoor Learning Environment referred to as SOLE for short. It's said to be the first of its kind according to Schneider Electric a company focused on energy sustainability and efficiency.

The classroom is the product of a partnership between Schneider and Conejo Valley Unified School District.

Principal Eric Bergmann shared an anecdote about a teacher's assignment to create a six-word autobiography during the ceremony. In thinking about one for Thousand Oaks High he came up with: a ""school where tradition meets innovation.""

Bergmann said SOLE aligned almost perfectly with the sentiment.

Marc Starkey Schneider program manager called the project the ""first ever 22nd century classroom.""

ICYMI:Oak Park Unified School District names next superintendent

Classroom features include a solar rooftop and battery storage meaning the district won't incur a significant cost to power it. The space boasts energy-efficient circulating fans LED lighting outdoor durable classroom furniture and an interactive white board.

Schneider brought on other companies including MbarC Construction Baker Electric Rexel USA Meteor Education and STS Education to bring the classroom to fruition.

It holds a typical class size up to 40 students. Teachers will have to do some training for the outdoor classroom and then can sign up for a timeslot to teach their classes in the space.

Heather Farrell a science teacher was instrumental in the process and worked with Schneider to bring SOLE to campus according to the district.

""I've always wanted to immerse my students in nature as we were exploring curriculum but we didn't have any place outside that we truly could hold class and still be productive"" Farrell said.

In 2018 she was handed a flyer about a sustainable outdoor classroom. This she said was what was missing from the learning experience.

Conejo Valley Unified School Board President Jenny Fitzgerald talked about the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outdoor classrooms were a no-brainer at first she explained but logistical difficulties quickly became apparent. Fitzgerald said SOLE's structure — able to withstand area winds provide cooling during hot days and provide a power source for laptops and other technology — creates an effective open-air learning space.

Coming up with SOLE

Schneider Electric came up with the project back about four to five years ago.

Starkey said in an earlier interview his company has worked with the district on projects on several campuses. This made it an ideal place for the SOLE project given the trust that had been built.

""We knew there was a value in bringing students out and creating shade and space that is a little alternative to your brick-and-mortar classroom"" he said.

The idea for outdoor classroom built off that initial idea.

Starkey and his team worked with Farrell and Thousand Oaks High School to create a plan to bring before school board.

At the time Starkey said the idea was ""to combine taking a well connected brick and mortar classroom and bringing it outside.""

The outdoor space was meant to have connectivity to internet and be entirely sustainable using the solar panels on the roof.

This means that regardless of whether the power grid is up or down or if the area is under a power shut-off the classroom would still be able to function he said.

That plan was approved during a Jan. 7 2020 school board meeting. Construction began in early December.

ICYMI:With help from American Rescue Plan Thousand Oaks plans $111 million of infrastructure projects

Starkey said the base project starts at about $250000 but the district's SOLE was donated at no cost to the district on the condition that Schneider could use it for promotional purposes.

He explained that many school districts loved the concept but had never seen one before. The idea was to get one built to be able to show what it would look like.

Starkey said the project definitely went over budget but that was in part because of the adjustments and modifications made while working with the Division of the State Architect which oversees design and construction for K-12 schools and community colleges.

Starkey said a big lesson learned was that even though there are not walls like a typical classroom the company still had to meet a lot of the same requirements.

He hopes more Southern California school districts will take advantage of alternative spaces like SOLE especially given the typical mild weather in the area.

A new bike is here to ditch standard batteries and use only clean solar energy instead. Its name is of course the SunRider.

kWh

It’s not surprising that a Dutch company came up with the concept of a solar cargo e-bike. The two founders Chris Cramer and Chris van Houdt wanted to take a big step towards reducing fossil fuels even more. The electric vehicle “revolution” is already changing the future and e-bikes are no longer the odd exception. However the founders of Need The Globe believed that there is even more that can be done in order to lower the environmental impact significantly.This is how the SunRider came to be. A unique bike that is presented as the first solar cargo e-bike to be developed so far. This innovative concept features integrated solar panels and the bike is equipped with a 250 W hub motor and a swappable 1.6battery. The three solar panels are able to add up to 545 Wp solar power.The other great thing about this e-bike is its cargo box which is both slim and spacious. The SunRider can fit 330 lbs. (150 kg) of cargo and the box is positioned so that it doesn’t obstruct visibility allowing the rider a 360-degree view. Plus this e-bike can be used for night-time transport as well thanks to its built-in lights.“The curves of the cargo box with integrated solar panels and the use of lightweight materials not only improve aerodynamics but also make the SunRider the lightest and the most elegant cargo e-bike on the market.” – says Chris Klok leader of NTG’s development team.The SunRider promises to reduce CO2 emissions by half compared to standard cargo e-bikes and by a whopping 95% compared to diesel delivery vans . This makes it a better alternative for the delivery industry as well.A solar-powered cargo e-bike is not only better for the environment but also for bike riders who will no longer depend on electricity grids and will have fewer costs for better mobility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rbGFob21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNC8yNC9zb2xhci1wb3dlcmVkLWRyb25lLWRldmVsb3BlZC1va2xhaG9tYS1hZXJvc3BhY2UtdGVzdC1mbGlnaHQvNzMwNDcxMTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar-powered drone made by Oklahoma aerospace company takes flight,"Imagine an aircraft that can remain in the sky for months without having to land and refuel.

That's the dream envisioned by Robert Miller CEO of Skydweller Aero an Oklahoma-based company developing an autonomous airplane powered by the sun. It's an ambitious and potentially lucrative idea that could be used for weather monitoring surveillance or even communication networks.

For the company's successful first test flight last week in Spain Skydweller Aero used the Solar Impulse 2 an aircraft already notable for its around-the-world flight using only solar power.

Before they can run with an autonomous drone they must first walk with a test pilot on board. It's like testing a self-driving car for the first time Miller said.

How is autonomous software tested?

""We're kind of doing the same thing except for an aircraft. In this case it's fly straight and level speed up speed down and turn left turn right circle all that kind of stuff"" he said. ""We're on track by this fall to have a fully autonomous aircraft.""

Some of the software is being developed in Oklahoma by a small team of engineers. By 2024 the company plans to employ 120 engineers and technicians in the state. Skydweller Aero's Oklahoma contingent also works on structural design and systems engineering.

In a news conference with Gov. Kevin Stitt last year Miller announced he would establish his headquarters in Ardmore. There's a possibility that some flight tests could occur in the United States he said.

""The eventual goal is that for our U.S. government customers we will be doing at least final assembly some manufacturing in Ardmore and doing the modifications of the aircraft for the U.S. government in Ardmore"" he said.

That will require some test flights there Miller added.

Clay Pearce director of structural engineering and manufacturing said these early flight tests involve significant contributions from the human on board. That will change over the next few months though as humans on the ground build autonomous software.

""The pilot is going to have a smaller and smaller role of actually flying the aircraft and become more just monitoring if you will until the aircraft is able to take off do fairly complex maneuvers and land all on its own"" Pearce said.

Need for aerospace engineers in Oklahoma

Skydweller Aero is one of several burgeoning aerospace companies looking for aerospace engineers. The industry has enough potential in Oklahoma that a trio of colleges are offering a program to help engineers who don't have an aerospace background bridge the gap into a new career.

As part of the new Aerospace and Cybersecurity Center of Workforce Excellence Rose State College Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology will offer non-credit certification courses later this spring.

“The Aerospace and Cybersecurity Center of Workforce Excellence is meant to be a collaborative effort between educators and industry partners to advance this vital sector of the Oklahoma economy and we are well-positioned to make an immediate impact as we launch our efforts” said Rose State Vice President of External Affairs Tamara Pratt.

Much like how Oklahoma oil and gas industry manufacturers are seeking new customers in aerospace and aviation engineers with experience in the oil field could make the same transition.

""I think engineering basics are the same"" Pearce said. ""In any field there's difficulty in transitional fields and in aerospace there are definitely some nuances that would make it more difficult. That also depends as always on the mentoring and training.""

Miller said despite a proactive congressional delegation and state leadership pushing the aerospace industry there's still work that needs to be done. Most of Oklahoma's aerospace output in recent years has been on maintenance repair and overhaul. Both the commercial and defense sectors have a large MRO presence here with Tinker Air Force Base in Midwest City and the American Airlines Base Maintenance Center in Tulsa.

""What we need to build is more of the higher-tech development cutting edge technology in aviation and space"" Miller said. ""Do we need more? Absolutely. Are we heading in the right direction? I believe the current leadership is doing an excellent job of transitioning Oklahoma into where we can move the economic engine of aerospace and defense.""

Well sort of. Not a ring of icy or dusty “moonlets” or grains like those surrounding the gas and ice giants in our solar system Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune. Instead it’s a circumsolar ring of dust that is a ring of dust moving around the sun along Venus’ orbit. Now NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has sent back the first complete view of this ring the space agency reported on April 16 2021.

Previous spacecraft had provided partial views of the ring but this is the first time it has been imaged for nearly the full 360 degrees around the sun.

Researchers published the peer-reviewed results in The Astrophysical Journal on April 7 2021.

Lead author Guillermo Stenborg from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said that:

This is the first time that a circumsolar dust ring in the inner solar system could be revealed in its full glory in ‘white light’ images. I find that pretty special.

Venus is embedded within the ring which circles the sun much as the asteroid belt does. But this ring is only composed of very fine microscopic dust particles. The ring isn’t that easy to see so how did Parker Solar Probe image it?

? ?

The probe used its Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) instrument which is primarily for observing the solar wind a stream of charged particles from the sun. The solar wind is fainter than the dust in interplanetary space. The dust is easier to see in images since it reflects about 100 times more light than the particles in the solar wind. That same kind of dust creates the zodiacal light which can be seen on Earth as a faint column of light projecting upwards from the horizon.

To observe the solar wind the mission team processed the images to remove the space dust. What they didn’t realize at first was that the Venus dust ring was also removed from the images during this process. It was seen later however after Parker Solar Probe changed the orientation of its cameras during rolling maneuvers (to prepare for its next flyby of the sun). Parker Solar Probe Project Scientist Nour Raouafi said:

It’s funny that spacecraft operations can sometimes lead to the discovery of new things. It’s kind of amazing.

Analysis of the images suggests that the dust in the ring is about 10 times more dense than dust in the surrounding interplanetary space.

Two earlier missions that observed the Venus dust ring are the German-American Helios spacecraft and NASA’s STEREO mission. Scientists have been able to develop new models of the dust ring based on those measurements. But the new data from Parker Solar Probe provide unprecedented new details.

Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly where the dust in Venus’ orbit comes from. It’s been long thought that most of it comes from asteroids and comets but as reported previously in EarthSky a new study suggest much of it may come from dust storms on Mars where some of the dust escapes into space.

The new views of the dust ring are exciting for scientists but the researchers are also interested in an absence of dust. Each orbit of Parker Solar Probe brings it closer to the sun and it has been long thought that there is a dust-free zone close to the sun. This would result from the dust being heated and vaporized in this region. Parker Solar Probe could confirm the existence of this dust-free zone and indeed has already observed regions of thinning dust as it gets closer to the sun.

Parker Solar Probe is one of NASA’s latest missions to study the closest star our sun in more detail than ever before. It is already providing researchers with valuable new information about how the sun behaves particularly with respect to its outer corona (the part we see during a total eclipse of the sun when the sun’s body is blocked by the moon) and the solar wind.

Space dust might sound lowly in contrast to mighty stars and planets. But this dust can tell scientists a lot about the origins of the planets and other bodies in our solar system. The building blocks of both planets and stars might be formed from this kind of dust As Stenborg said:

We’re learning things about the dynamics the exchanges of dust particles throughout the heliosphere [the sphere of our sun’s influence] that before Parker Solar Probe we didn’t know.

NASA’s Solar Orbiter spacecraft craft is also expected to be able to provide new views of the dust ring since its orbit around the sun takes it beyond Venus’ path and high above the ecliptic plane.

Bottom line: NASA’s Parker Solar Probe currently studying the sun has observed the entire dust ring that encircles the sun along Venus’ orbit. It is the first complete view of this dust band from any spacecraft.

Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points 16 rebounds and six assists as the Milwaukee Bucks avoided a third consecutive loss with a 124-117 win over the under-manned Philadelphia 76ers.

Khris Middleton added 24 points Bobby Portis had 23 and Brook Lopez 16 for the Bucks who snapped a two-game losing streak. Jrue Holiday had 12 points and 11 assists for the Bucks who improved to 36-22 on the season.

Milwaukee bolted out to a huge lead making their first 10 shots of the game. They led by 17 points at the half 77-60.

The Bucks drained 13 of their first 21 three-point attempts and finished with 20 threes on 40 attempts.

This was billed as a matchup of two top teams of the Eastern Conference but Philadelphia is going through a rough patch.

They were missing Ben Simmons (illness) and Furkan Korkmaz (ankle) in losing their third straight.

“Philly is a team we might see in the playoffs” said Antetokounmpo. “Everybody was locked in and came out with energy. It was a good test for us.

“Today was a playoff game for me another step. We got to stay humble. We have been number one seed in the east we just came up short the last two years.

“If we go in as the seventh seed or sixth or fifth it doesn’t matter. You got to beat the great teams in order to win a (title).

“If we get the number one seed great. If we don’t we got to get better.”

Joel Embiid led the 76ers with 24 points. Shake Milton chipped in 20 and Tobias Harris had 18 in his first game back after being out with a sore knee.

The teams will face off again Saturday.

Elsewhere Luka Doncic scored a team-high 30 points as the Dallas Mavericks rolled to a 115-110 win over the Los Angeles Lakers spoiling the return of Anthony Davis.

Lakers star Davis was playing his first contest after missing 30 games with a calf strain. He looked rusty making just two of 12 baskets and finishing with four points.",,,,,,,,,

Generally they sold well most years a favorite of bargain-minded company car fleet purchasers but not really competitive with the best-in-class offerings from Peugeot Volkswagen Rover and others.

Richard Parry-Jones changed that.

When he became Ford's chief of vehicle engineering in Europe in the early '90s Parry-Jones focused on making fun-to-drive Fords that consumers actually wanted to buy. RPJ as he was known within Ford made his name by focusing hard on getting a vehicle's chassis right and by taking an interest in every part of the car as a customer would.

He died April 16 in a tractor accident on his farm in Wales at age 69.

""I worked with Richard for many years on developing Ford 'DNA metrics' to characterize everything from how the steering should feel to the comfort of the seats and the cupholder design!"" Joe Bakaj Ford's former vice president of product development in Europe told me.

The 1993 Ford Mondeo — versions of which were sold in North America as the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique — was Ford's first ""world car."" Handsome and praised for its fluid handling stylish interior and superior quality the Mondeo won a trophy case full of awards. It ushered in a new era for Ford under RPJ that later saw the Ka Puma Focus and others generate strong sales.

""I had never met the previous chief engineer of vehicle engineering who was a fairly aloof old-school manager"" Bakaj said. ""That changed rapidly when Richard came on board. He would often turn up unannounced at my desk and ask me questions about [noise vibration and harshness] and talk about how the Mondeo program was going.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vdmlzdWFsc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTA0LWZvcmQtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1iYXR0ZXJpZXMuYW1w0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS92aXN1YWxzdG9yaWVzLzIwMjEtMDQtZm9yZC1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLWJhdHRlcmllcy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford plans to develop and produce electric vehicle batteries,"Hau Thai-Tang the company's chief product and operations officer said electric vehicles are moving from early adopters to an early majority as new models come out and Ford wants to lead the transition.""We now see that the market is going to develop very quickly and we will have sufficient scale to justify having greater levels of integration"" he said. ""We will no longer take an approach of hedging our bets and planning around the uncertainty of how fast that will play out.""The move comes as the global auto industry races to control supplies including precious metals needed to make batteries and individual cells that form big battery packs to run as many as 300 new electric models coming out in the next two years. Under new CEO Jim Farley the plan is a reversal from Ford's previous path of buying technology and batteries from supply companies.

An estimated 25 trucks — pouring every hour for 10 hours — ended up laying a total of more than 2000 yards of concrete Rich Bardelli project construction manager told the Free Press on Sunday.

Ford is planning to spend four more days on a similar schedule over the next month or so for a total of 11000 yards of concrete poured he said.

The concrete is stabilizing part of the sub-basement of the station that had been underwater for decades. Ford previously had work crews pump out nearly 227000 gallons of water that flooded the station's basement and its little-known sub-basement.

""It was our first pour like this to take care of the basement area"" Bardelli said. ""This is one of the first big pours we've had. To have such coordination was really exciting getting those trucks pulled in one after another three different batch plants from Superior Concrete.""

Christman-Brinker is playing a key role in coordinating the massive operation.

The train depot which opened the day after Christmas in 1913 has been abandoned since 1988. After Ford purchased the site in 2018 and announced plans for the $350 million renovation that includes city and state tax incentives people from across America and around the world responded with joy.

Structural engineers hired by Ford to restore the iconic train station assessed the wide-open basement with big columns and determined the weight of the building would be better supported by a cement slab instead of just the columns Bardelli said. Columns remain but they're reinforced Bardelli said.

Originally builders dug a big hole built these columns and put a concrete slab across the columns which were underwater for 30 years he said.

This was the most effective and cost-efficient path to stability Bardelli said.

The image of trucks lined up in front of the iconic structure attracted attention from some who posted images on social media.

""Big work being done at @Ford's Michigan Central Station"" tweeted Detroiter Jeff DeBruyn at 7:40 a.m.

Ford made a commitment to its construction route on Saturday that restricted truck entry and exit points to keep the heavy vehicles off neighborhood streets and to disrupt the community as little as possible.

'All coming together' now

The train station remains on schedule to open by the end of 2022.

""It's really exciting"" Bardelli said. ""When you walk in the building now we're putting the building back together. It's the fun part of the job. You see things that took time to get stable structurally and get the building dry. Now the plaster work it's all coming together.""

The terra cotta arch system — the vaulted system in the train station's waiting room — was designed by the famous architect Rafael Guastavino a Spaniard who moved to the U.S. in the late 1800s.

One-third of the Guastavino vaulted ceiling in the waiting room is done Bardelli said.

""We just poured the first floor floor in the tower"" he said. ""That was a big milestone for us.""

This effort is a passion project for Bardelli.

His mother Rose Farrugia Bardelli now 80 grew up in Corktown. She's Maltese the heritage of many in what is the oldest neighborhood in Detroit. Farrugia lived at the corner of 12th and Church streets before 12th was renamed Rosa Parks Boulevard.

""I brought all her brothers and sisters through the station"" Rich Bardelli said in August. ""Funny thing about it you don't think you talk to your parents or aunts and uncles about what they were like when they were younger or where they lived. My uncle worked at the old Lincoln brass factory across from their house. My grandmother worked at the hosiery factory which is our first Ford building we did.""

He talked about finding keepsakes at the train station like an old whiskey bottle tucked between the walls — left there by plasterers more than 100 years ago.

""Our guys are taking the plaster down and come to find out they pull this bottle out this whiskey bottle with a little bit left in the bottle"" Bardelli said. ""The plaster guys were plastered. Back then they just drank. And they set that empty bottle on the ledge and just left it there. But they were artisans.""

The fortunes the executives stand to gain based on a Wall Street Journal analysis of recent GameStop securities filings reflect the rapid and unusual rise in the company’s market value as it became a darling of individual investors and the focus of a turnaround steered by activist investor and Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen. Three of the four executives joined the company in 2019.

GameStop has said that Mr. Sherman will step down by July 31 and that it is searching for his replacement. His exit agreement calls for the accelerated vesting of more than 1.1 million GameStop shares according to filings valued at roughly $169 million as of Friday’s close.

Mr. Sherman’s severance pay could have been higher. According to his separation agreement and GameStop’s recent proxy filing the CEO agreed to give up at least $5 million in cash stock valued at roughly $47 million as of Friday and additional equity awards. No reason was given for the changes and Mr. Sherman declined to comment.

As of mid-April Mr. Sherman held a roughly 2.4% stake in the company making him one of the largest individual shareholders.

Restricted shares held by former GameStop finance chief James Bell vested April 1 according to the proxy filing. Those shares were valued at $43.6 million as of Friday. The company didn’t cite a reason for Mr. Bell’s departure though the Journal reported that he was pushed out of the role by Mr. Cohen according to people familiar with the matter.

Frank Hamlin who resigned as chief customer officer last month had restricted shares that vested April 7 and were valued at $33.5 million as of Friday.

Chris Homeister who plans to resign as merchandising chief because of diminished responsibilities has nearly 289000 shares due to vest in connection with this exit. Those shares were valued at around $43.6 million as of Friday.

Messrs. Bell Hamlin and Homeister could earn additional shares under their employment agreements based on the company’s performance this year according to GameStop filings.

Mr. Bell declined to comment. Messrs. Hamlin and Homeister couldn’t be reached for comment.

Granting shares as part of compensation packages is a longstanding practice intended to align executives’ interests with shareholders’ interests. As a company’s performance or outlook improves the thinking goes share prices should rise and both executives and shareholders benefit.

STOCKS RETREATS FROM RECORDS INTEL BOEING DRAG ON DOW

Big payouts for departing executives especially longtime ones aren’t unusual. Former T-Mobile US Inc. boss John Legere collected more than $137 million in compensation in 2020 according to a securities filing Wednesday. Most of that came from the then-chief executive’s severance payment after more than seven years atop the telecommunications company as well as equity that vested early upon his departure and bonuses tied to the company’s successful completion of its merger with Sprint Corp.

Mr. Sherman’s compensation for the 2020 fiscal year was valued at $7.2 million most of which came from stock awards according to a proxy filing. That figure includes about $1.5 million in shares that Mr. Sherman is giving up under his departure agreement. His total compensation in the prior year was $12.4 million the first year he served as CEO.

The payouts for Messrs. Sherman and Legere reflect a broader trend of CEO compensation surging in 2020. Median pay for the chief executives of more than 300 of the biggest U.S. public companies reached $13.7 million last year up from $12.8 million for the same companies a year earlier and on track for a record a recent Journal analysis concludes.

Mr. Sherman joined GameStop in April 2019 a few months after the company failed to find a buyer. He became the company’s fifth CEO since 2017 and pledged to turn the retailer around. During his tenure GameStop was able to reduce its costs and debt but the business has struggled. Revenue fell to nearly $5.1 billion in the year ended Jan. 30 from $6.5 billion in the prior year. Losses topped $686 million in the past two fiscal years combined.

The company didn’t cite a reason for Mr. Bell’s departure though the Journal reported that he was pushed out of the role by Mr. Cohen according to people familiar with the matter.

Frank Hamlin who resigned as chief customer officer last month had restricted shares that vested April 7 and were valued at $33.5 million as of Friday.

Chris Homeister who plans to resign as merchandising chief because of diminished responsibilities has nearly 289000 shares due to vest in connection with this exit. Those shares were valued at around $43.6 million as of Friday.

Messrs. Bell Hamlin and Homeister could earn additional shares under their employment agreements based on the company’s performance this year according to GameStop filings.

Mr. Bell declined to comment. Messrs. Hamlin and Homeister couldn’t be reached for comment.

Granting shares as part of compensation packages is a longstanding practice intended to align executives’ interests with shareholders’ interests. As a company’s performance or outlook improves the thinking goes share prices should rise and both executives and shareholders benefit.

STOCKS RETREATS FROM RECORDS INTEL BOEING DRAG ON DOW

Big payouts for departing executives especially longtime ones aren’t unusual. Former T-Mobile US Inc. boss John Legere collected more than $137 million in compensation in 2020 according to a securities filing Wednesday. Most of that came from the then-chief executive’s severance payment after more than seven years atop the telecommunications company as well as equity that vested early upon his departure and bonuses tied to the company’s successful completion of its merger with Sprint Corp.

Mr. Sherman’s compensation for the 2020 fiscal year was valued at $7.2 million most of which came from stock awards according to a proxy filing. That figure includes about $1.5 million in shares that Mr. Sherman is giving up under his departure agreement. His total compensation in the prior year was $12.4 million the first year he served as CEO.

The payouts for Messrs. Sherman and Legere reflect a broader trend of CEO compensation surging in 2020. Median pay for the chief executives of more than 300 of the biggest U.S. public companies reached $13.7 million last year up from $12.8 million for the same companies a year earlier and on track for a record a recent Journal analysis concludes.

Mr. Sherman joined GameStop in April 2019 a few months after the company failed to find a buyer. He became the company’s fifth CEO since 2017 and pledged to turn the retailer around. During his tenure GameStop was able to reduce its costs and debt but the business has struggled. Revenue fell to nearly $5.1 billion in the year ended Jan. 30 from $6.5 billion in the prior year. Losses topped $686 million in the past two fiscal years combined.

To improve its outlook the company last month tapped Mr. Cohen former boss of online pet-supplies company Chewy to head a committee dedicated to making the business more tech-centric by focusing more on e-commerce. Mr. Sherman recently said he expects GameStop to benefit from plans to expand the company’s product selection to make it less dependent on the releases of new game consoles from the likes of Sony Group Corp. and Microsoft Corp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvZmFuZHVlbC1vd25lci1pcy1zdGlsbC13b3J0aC1hLWZsdXR0ZXItazUyMnozaG5i0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FanDuel owner is still worth a flutter,"New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill last week that would allow the first bets to be taken at next year’s Super Bowl on February 13.

Industrial metals from copper to aluminum to iron ore have rallied to the highest level in years.The reasons for their gains are plentiful: Copper -- critical for everything from electrical wiring to motors and thus a bellwether for the global economy -- broke out of its recent range to trade near the highest since the last supercycle as industrial operations ramp up worldwide. Iron ore aluminum and steel are meanwhile gaining on speculation that production cuts will shrink supplies just as demand is taking off. And a weaker dollar is making commodities traded in the currency cheaper to buy.But underpinning the rally is one simple fact: Some of the world’s large economies such as the U.S. and China are recovering from the pandemic stoking demand for more cars electronics and infrastructure. U.S. President Joe Biden’s $2.25 trillion infrastructure package and bets that more aggressive climate pledges will accelerate the proliferation of solar panels wind turbines and electric cars are further driving gains and raising fears about metal shortages. This week’s U.S. climate summit only intensified those concerns.“Biden’s new climate promises and at least lip service by China to greener domestic policies are keeping the demand picture rosy” said Tai Wong head of metals derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets . Shrinking inventories this week also continued to buttress supply concerns he said.Virtually every metal vital to industrial operations gained this week as a result. Copper was up 1.6% to cap off the week at $9551.50 a metric ton in London the highest closing price since August 2011. Iron ore rose in Singapore. Chinese steel futures reached new highs as investors weighed the nation’s commitment to lowering output against strong demand. Shanghai rebar reached the highest since futures began trading in 2009.Jiangxi Copper Co. China’s top smelter expects prices to reach $10000 as plans to curb carbon emissions boost demand for the metal critical to the green-energy transition. Meanwhile orders for copper stored in warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange have picked up with 83150 tons of metal now earmarked for withdrawal the highest level since July.“The outlook for copper has never been better” said Richard Adkerson chief executive officer of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. the top publicly traded producer. Supporting that view are scarce stockpiles strong demand and a dearth of big new projects waiting in the wings.While banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expect further gains in metals including copper there are simmering concerns that could still subvert the rally. Copper had cooled through March and early April on worries about a global resurgence in the coronavirus and new variants of the virus still pose a threat to plans to reopen economies. The possibility of reduced stimulus in China could also slow the world’s second-biggest economy and torpedo metal demand.For now signs point to economies on the mend. Applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance unexpectedly plunged to a fresh pandemic low. Key indicators for consumer and industrial activity are rising in China.Palladium a metal used in catalytic converters to curb emissions in gasoline-powered vehicles reached an all-time high this week for similar reasons. Between rising car demand tightening pollution controls and production disruptions the world is set to be short on supply for a 10th straight year according to UBS Group AG.Meanwhile Chinese authorities and the broader steel industry have pledged to lower output after reaching record levels last year. And China’s steel hub Tangshan is facing a slew of production restrictions amid the push to control emissions. Crude steel production neared a record in March while rebar inventories declined for a sixth consecutive week signaling strength in demand amid the construction season.Aluminum prices are also rallying with London futures up about 20% this year supported by expectations for further supply curbs in China the biggest producer.Stoking supply concerns are soaring Covid cases in Latin American nations including Brazil and Chile which threaten to curb output at mines. The price rally has caught the attention of unions and politicians in host nations. The Chilean copper industry is facing a slew of wage talks and the leading presidential candidate in Peru wants to renegotiate contracts with mines to channel more of their profit to communities.“Consumption’s increasing across Europe the U.S. and Asia and then we have supply-side stress in Latin America coupled with some very strong technical signals” Michael Cuoco head of hedge-fund sales for metals and bulk materials at StoneX Group said by telephone. “There really is a perfect storm brewing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

White's death was due to a gunshot wound to the torso and it was ruled a homicide.

ORIGINAL STORY

Police are investigating a deadly early morning shooting on the Las Vegas Strip Sunday where one person was killed and two others were injured.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Lt. Ray Spencer says around 3 a.m. a group of men got into a fight outside of the Hawaiian Marketplace on Las Vegas Boulevard near Harmon Avenue.

Soon after one of the men in the group began shooting striking a man involved in the altercation before taking off from the scene.

The suspect has been identified by police as 25-year-old Malik Frost

Spencer says two men tried chasing the suspected gunman Frost with one throwing a rock at his head.

However Frost then turned and fired three more shots striking another man in the leg with a ricochet hitting a third person. Both of these men were expected to survive with treatment being done at Sunrise Hospital for the man who was shot in the leg.

Spencer says police arrived within a minute of the shooting and officers were able to take the gunman into custody at a nearby motel.

Frost was transported to University Medical Center where he was treated for his head injury.

After being released he was booked at Clark County Detention Center on Open Murder and Attempted Murder charges.

The identification of the victim as well as the cause and manner of death will be released by the Clark County Coroner’s Office.

All of the men involved in this incident were in their 20s according to police and the shooter is believed to be from Las Vegas.

If you work from home your boss can now monitor your productivity with software that keeps track of what you are doing on your computer.

With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic many people around the world started working from home. As a result many companies felt the need to keep a closer eye on whether their staff were really as diligent as they pretended to be.

The advent of tattleware such as Staffhub Teramind and Interguard developed by technology companies in the US now allows employers to monitor their workforce’s operations on their computers during working hours.

The research and consulting company Gartner estimates that by the end of last year as many as 80% of companies worldwide had implemented some form of tattleware on their workers’ computers.

Tattleware is especially popular with company executives in the US but it is likely to spill over to South Africa Phetheni Nkuna director of employee practice at Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr

Products such as Staffhub Teramind and Interguard for example track workers’ movements with the computer mouse and keyboard. They also look at how often and for how long certain work programs are idle says Phetheni Nkuna director of employee practice at Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr one of Africa’s largest corporate and commercial law firms.

“Tattleware is especially popular with company executives in the US but it is likely to spill over to South Africa” she says.

The information generated by the software enables bosses to get a profile and analysis of a worker’s computer operations and then compare this with others doing the same kind of work.

“They can therefore determine who is getting more done and who is just marking time” says Nkuna.

Some of the tattleware even goes so far as to check the content of workers’ social media messages. In other cases screenshots are taken from computer screens from time to time. There is also tattleware that monitors the music that workers listen to or their facial expressions and tone of voice according to nytimes.com.

Although the working from home trend makes it necessary to measure workers’ productivity digitally companies will be very careful not to infringe on the privacy and rights of employees says Nkuna.

“Individuals’ privacy is protected in the Constitution and there is also the Protection of Personal Information Act that for example determines how data may be collected processed and stored and that could be a potential minefield.”

According to Nkuna the fact that workers have to set aside an area in their homes to do their work could in itself infringe on their privacy. Conversely an employer could argue that as long as the staff member uses company equipment it is permissible to check their communication and activities.

There’s a fine line. On the one hand workers have the right to privacy. On the other the employer is entitled to ensure that there is productivity among their workforce Phetheni Nkuna

The Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act makes it legal for companies to intercept and check staff communications when using the company’s computer or cellphone.

“But there’s a fine line. On the one hand workers have the right to privacy. On the other the employer is entitled to ensure that there is productivity among their workforce. In South Africa no law is absolute – there are limits. It will be interesting to see how the courts handle such cases” says Nkuna.

Meanwhile Jon Hyman a partner at US law firm Wickens Herzer Panza says on the website workforce.com that installing tattleware is unfair.

“We ask so much of workers – now during the pandemic even more. A 9am to 5pm working day is no longer an issue.

“If my staff member who gives up his or her evenings and weekends for me wants to spend a few minutes during the day to post something on Facebook or wants to see the score of last night’s game or wants to buy something from Amazon I really don’t mind” Hyman says.

“I will only be bothered if this affects their performance. But then you must talk about it. It’s not a technology problem.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52aXJnaW5pc2xhbmRzZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvc21vb2tsZXItdGFrZS10b3AtYW5nbGVyLWp1c3QtZmlzaC10b3AtYm9hdC1pbi12aXJnaW4taXNsYW5kcy1nYW1lLWZpc2hpbmctY2x1Yi1zL2FydGljbGVfMzUyMmM5NDMtNTQwYy01MDQ1LTlmNGYtY2I5M2VlMDNhMzcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smookler take Top Angler 'Just Fish' Top Boat in Virgin Islands Game Fishing Club's Dolphin Derby,"×

This is something shareholders will keep in mind as they cast their votes on company resolutions such as executive remuneration in the upcoming AGM on 30 April 2021. We present our case of why we think CEO compensation looks fair.

View our latest analysis for Kellogg

How Does Total Compensation For Steve Cahillane Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?

At the time of writing our data shows that Kellogg Company has a market capitalization of US$22b and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$12m for the year to January 2021. We note that's an increase of 20% above last year. While we always look at total compensation first our analysis shows that the salary component is less at US$1.3m.

For comparison other companies in the industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b reported a median total CEO compensation of US$12m. This suggests that Kellogg remunerates its CEO largely in line with the industry average. Moreover Steve Cahillane also holds US$7.4m worth of Kellogg stock directly under their own name which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.

Component 2021 2019 Proportion (2021) Salary US$1.3m US$1.3m 11% Other US$10m US$8.4m 89% Total Compensation US$12m US$9.7m 100%

On an industry level roughly 30% of total compensation represents salary and 70% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that Kellogg allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.

A Look at Kellogg Company's Growth Numbers

Over the last three years Kellogg Company has not seen its earnings per share change much though there is a slight positive movement. In the last year its revenue is up 1.5%.

We would argue that the improvement in revenue is good but isn't particularly impressive but we're happy with the modest EPS growth. So there are some positives here but not enough to earn high praise. Looking ahead you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..

Has Kellogg Company Been A Good Investment?

Kellogg Company has generated a total shareholder return of 17% over three years so most shareholders would be reasonably content. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.

Story continues

To Conclude...

The company's decent performance might have made most shareholders happy possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the concerns to be discussed in the upcoming AGM. Despite the pleasing results we still think that any proposed increases to CEO compensation will be examined based on a case by case basis and linked to performance outcomes.

CEO compensation is a crucial aspect to keep your eyes on but investors also need to keep their eyes open for other issues related to business performance. We did our research and spotted 1 warning sign for Kellogg that investors should look into moving forward.

Arguably business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this free list of interesting companies that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.

The installs are part a larger agreement with Viasat that will also see 21 of KLM’s Embraer E-195 twinjets equipped in time.

Installing a broadband IFC system onto any aircraft is always a notable occurrence. After all onboard Internet is considered a key amenity for modern travelers. But installing a system amid a global pandemic — and factoring in lockdowns travel restrictions and the winter holidays — can add material complexity to the equation.

Viasat’s airline customers handle the installations whether in-house or via their select MRO partners. The company’s high-capacity Ka-band satellite solution takes roughly three days to install on a 737 inclusive of the antenna install atop the aircraft fuselage.

Don Buchman Viasat’s vice president and general manager commercial aviation tells Runway Girl Network that the Carlsbad California-based satellite operator and aero ISP was able to support KLM throughout the process remotely.

With several years worth of history and knowledge in Ka-band satcom installs the process went “almost perfect” confides Buchman. “We can do most of it almost entirely remotely from a support perspective.”

He adds:

They can do it almost on autopilot.

All KLM aircraft earmarked for the Viasat IFC system operate European flight routes only. Having provided the Internet service free-of-charge starting 22 April for a week KLM will initially offer three inflight connectivity packages — messaging surf and stream — on all Viasat-equipped aircraft which transmit data over Viasat’s high-capacity KA-SAT satellite.

The messaging option will give all passengers 30-minutes of free text messaging via WhatsApp Facebook Messenger and WeChat while the higher-bandwidth surf and stream options can be purchased though we await clarity on the price points for KLM’s short-haul operation.

Offering three tiers of connectivity service including a free messaging tier is intentional and brings a level of consistency to passengers. While the Air France short-haul fleet offers Global Eagle Ku-band connectivity Air France-KLM’s longhaul operation has been installing Gogo’s 2Ku broadband connectivity solution to Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s.

Nearly 80 widebodies are understood to have been fitted with Gogo 2Ku to date. And these aircraft offer three tiers of Internet service to passengers.

Notably given that Air France-KLM’s Boeing 787s are fitted with Panasonic Avionics’ eXConnect Ku-band connectivity service the airline holding company now technically has knowledge of no fewer than four inflight connectivity systems.

“Being Internet connected when on-the-go is a top priority for our customers. That’s why we’re working with Viasat to specifically define and tailor an inflight Wi-Fi approach that meets current and future IFC requirements on short- and medium-haul European flights” says KLM executive vice president customer service Boet Kreiken in a statement.

“We believe this new collaboration will enable us to deliver more memorable connected experiences when passengers fly on Viasat-equipped KLM aircraft.”

As passengers return to the skies “they’ll come back to this great new service” notes Buchman to RGN.

We believe this was the first MR guided fully adapted stereotactic radiotherapy treatment of renal cancer in the United Kingdom

This was the case of MJ a 70-year-old patient with multiple longstanding comorbidities who had been found to have a large left sided kidney mass.

Biopsies confirmed the presence of clear cell carcinoma Furhman grade 2. The lesion was measured at 8cm in maximal diameter therefore staged at T2N0M0.

The patient was offered a nephrectomy but was unable to accept this as it was felt they would not tolerate the surgical process or the recovery period.

After some research on alternatives to surgery the patient and family requested a consultation with me at GenesisCare which took place via telephone call as the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing.

Renal cancers have traditionally been thought of as resistant to radiotherapy. This theory no longer holds true in the era of modern image guided radiotherapy. Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) in renal cancer yields very good results. In a study looking at single fraction SABR to 118 consecutive patients the rates of local control cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were 97.8% 95.7% and 77.4% respectively at 2 years; and 97.8% 91.9% and 65.4% respectively at 4 years1.

When renal cancers arise in patients who are medically inoperable or who wish to avoid surgery and where focal ablation such as radiofrequency ablation is not indicated due to the size or position of the cancer in the kidney SABR is a viable alternative that allows effective treatment in this older largely medically inoperable cohort with clearly demonstrated efficacy tolerability and modest impact on renal function in this patient population2.

The consultation touched upon the available evidence for SABR in renal cancers particularly for those patients who do not wish to undergo an operation and therefore refuses this option as was the case for this particular patient.

I explained about how our MRIdian service could help particularly the machine’s ability to take MRI cine images during therapy allowing us to track the movement of the tumour with respiration and “gate” the treatment i.e. only turn on the treatment beam when the target is in the right place. The patient would be treated over the course of five treatment visits on alternate days.

The dose used was 40Gy in 5 fractions treating on alternate days.

The plan achieved ensured all parameters were met and all organs at risk were kept within tolerance with special attention being paid to the contralateral kidney.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVtaXVtdGltZXNuZy5jb20vaGVhbHRoLzQ1NzI3My1tYXJjZWxsZS1ydXRoLWNhbmNlci1jZW50cmUtc3BlY2lhbGlzdC1ob3NwaXRhbC1vcGVucy13b3JsZC1jbGFzcy10cmVhdG1lbnQtY2VudHJlLWluLWxhZ29zLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marcelle Ruth Cancer Centre & Specialist Hospital opens world-class treatment centre in Lagos,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1Y2tpbmdoYW1zaGlyZWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvaGlzdG9yeS9nYWxsZXJ5L2Zhc2NpbmF0aW5nLXBob3Rvcy1pbnNpZGUtYW1lcnNoYW1zLXJhZGlvYWN0aXZlLTUyOTU3MjXSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5idWNraW5naGFtc2hpcmVsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hpc3RvcnkvZ2FsbGVyeS9mYXNjaW5hdGluZy1waG90b3MtaW5zaWRlLWFtZXJzaGFtcy1yYWRpb2FjdGl2ZS01Mjk1NzI1LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fascinating photos from inside Amersham's radioactive lab,"It's been there for over 80 years

Amersham has a long history of being connected to the atomic industry dating back to the 1940s.

Chilcote House was first a site for the extraction of radium from radium concentrates under scientist Dr Walter Patrick Grove CBE.

According to the Amersham Museum Dr. Grove once remarked when he visited the lab in 1940: ""To my immense satisfaction was visible a whole series of beakers whose contents were glowing in the dark with radioactivity – varying in colour from bright blue at the top end to a vague white in the lower stages.

""It was quite unexpected and the impact on me must have been almost as great as it was on the Curies 40 years earlier when they saw the phenomenon for the first time.”

The radioactive materials formed in Amersham were initially used to make luminous dials and gunsights for ships and aircraft.

The site was bought by Thorium Ltd by the Ministry of Supply in 1946 and its name was changed to The Radiochemical Centre three years later.

In 1954 in Amersham the country's first specially designed buildings for the production of isotopes for medical and industrial uses opened and the goods were exported around the world.

There was a period of expansion throughout the 1960s and on April 1 1971 Dr Grove became the Managing Director with the organisation changing to become a limited company.

By the middle of the 1970s staff numbers had shot up to 1000 and sales were increasing at ""double figure millions of pound"".

In 1982 the site was renamed Amersham International Ltd and it became the first company to be privatised by Margaret Thatcher.

After experiencing a number of different private owners throughout the 1980s and 1990s due to various mergers it was acquired by German Electric (GE) making it part of the GE Healthcare business which it is still owned by today.

GEN,Gen Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlci5maXR0LmNvL2dlbi16LXdlbGxuZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Move Over Millennials: Gen Z Is The New Wellness Consumer,"Born in the mid-1990s Gen Z is now the largest generation in America.

But for many brands their habits and preferences can be mystifying.

From wellness to mental health and sustainability today we’re exploring Gen Z’s perspective and influence on the future of well-being.

The Zoomer Effect

As Gen Z (sometimes referred to as Zoomers) comes of age amidst a global pandemic health and wellness are unsurprisingly top of mind.

91% of Gen Z report physical or psychological problems due to stress and they are more likely than any other cohort to have gone to therapy.

72% say they view healthy eating as an integral part of both their physical and mental health.

60% believe that the pandemic’s single most important effect on society will be taking care of one’s health.

But “health and wellness” means something different to this generation than it did to others.

Previously health was dominated by clinical science a “white coat era” deemed necessary to establish credibility and trust for consumers. Millennials then ushered in a “natural era” an expansion of wellness into alternative care options beyond primary care.

Now Gen Z is changing the game once again.

While they piggyback on millennials’ views of holistic health Gen Z was raised under political and economic turmoil meaning they’re more pragmatic than their idealistic elders. That is they integrate health and wellness into their day-to-day life but as digital natives will heavily vet the brands they select into their routines.

Further they are happy to leverage the latest tech to support their health instinctively adopting everything from connected fitness to wearables. And unlike their privacy-protecting predecessors Gen Z grew up with apps and are more willing to trade data for convenience.

Reaching Gen Z

Notoriously ad-averse Gen Z are quick to dismiss dated marketing attempts as “cheugy” or insincere. Beyond getting their attention brands must work to establish trust and credibility with a consumer that is both savvy and skeptical.

So what actually works?

Stoke the digital campfire. Gen Z has flocked en masse to “digital campfires” like TikTok Discord and Slack online micro-communities where experiences are shared and discussed.

Tapping TikTok. 49% of users purchase a product after seeing it on TikTok. Notably ads here feel more organic and Gen Z appears to welcome even sponsored content within the platform:

Facing competition from DTC brands mattress manufacturer Simmons teamed up with TikTok creators to launch a hashtag #snoozzzapalooza amassing 6B views and a 107% boost in traffic to its site.

Mental health app Breathwrk has capitalized on TikTok’s “Jump” feature which allows content creators to link to third-party content like the platform’s breathing exercises.

Activewear brands like Fabletics drove down VIP member acquisition costs by 15x while Australian-based The Athlete’s Foot generated 8.5M impressions for its shoe launch.

Welcome to the club. Taking it a step further brands have found success creating private group chats to dialogue with customers.

For its virtual summit Goop used Slack to provide product recommendations send exclusive discount codes and facilitate questions.

Sunscreen startup Everyday Humans uses a Slack-like app called Geneva to discuss skincare advice with consumers and provide behind-the-scenes brand info.

On the hiring side Chipotle hosted a “virtual job fair” on Discord over the summer attracting 4000 attendees and receiving over 24000 applications.

Dig into DIY. Gen Z is one of the most creative and entrepreneurial generations ever and brands that promote participation personalization and even co-creation are striking a chord.

In particular beauty brands have leaned into digital campfires that double as focus groups. Viewing health as both looking good and feeling good Gen Z is all-in.

Glossier credits its Slack group with helping co-create one of its top-selling products.

Kinship taps a group of Gen Zers for input on things like logo typography and beta product testing.

Glow Recipe hosts a private “Glow Gang” Instagram account which it uses for sampling and product feedback.

Other campfires to consider: Snapchat (the platform reaches over 90% of 13–24-year-old Americans) Clubhouse Pinterest VSCO and IMVU.

Keep it real. Gen Z craves honesty and they’re also more open to discussing difficult topics. Putting an ironic aesthetic spin on what was previously taboo this attitude has driven a “Great Destigmatization” of sorts:

Sexual wellness is seeing a renaissance with Maude Cake and Dame all cashing in.

Not one to shy away from blood Gen Z is reimagining menstrual care with brands like Aavia and TOP.

On the beauty side acne brands like Starface and squish. are Gen Z mainstays.

The Principled Consumer

For Gen Z authenticity doubles as a filter. This generation encounters more brands than ever before says Sonia Nigam CEO of Change:

“With plug-and-play platforms like Shopify and organic marketing tools like TikTok it’s never been easier to jumpstart an online brand… that means consumers have the luxury of choice.”

Rich with options Gen Z buys based on principles rather than price picking products that are ethical sustainable and authentic.

They eat clean foods tend to their mental health and seek brands that resonate with their principles. Health and wellness brands are taking note:

Championing mental health and the “Power of She” Athleta’s partnerships with Simone Biles and Allyson Felix have drawn widespread Gen Z support.

From fish to dairy to chicken 62% of Gen Zers are willing to spend more money on more sustainable food. Brands like Nuggs and allplants are digging in.

73% of Gen Z are willing to pay more for sustainable products. This year lululemon debuted plant-based leggings while adidas and On Running have carved out large Gen Z followings with their eco-forward offerings.

One caveat. Brands must put their money where their mouths are when preaching authenticity — Gen Z are digitally fluent and are quick to uncover brands that miss the mark.

Looking Ahead

As Gen Z matures into mainstream buyers some predict they will be the “most disruptive generation ever.”

Despite having some members still in grade school Gen Z already commands an impressive $143B in purchasing power. Wielding significant sway over family purchases their indirect influence is even larger. Over 93% of parents say their kids affect household spend.

Punchline: Across the health and wellness landscape brands are already feeling the Gen Z impact. More than any other generation before them this cohort is all-in on health authenticity and sustainability rewarding brands that can speak their language and leaving the rest in the dust.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwMDA0OTAvdGhlLWRlYXRoLW9mLXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LWNvb2tpZXMtd2lsbC1yZXNoYXBlLWRpZ2l0YWwtYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The death of third-party cookies will reshape digital advertising,"Table of contents

Nothing on the internet is free

From news articles to web comics to cat videos the internet has more media than you could ask for much of it available for you to access without paying a dime.

But nothing in life is free and the internet is no exception. In reality there’s a deal happening every time you consume a piece of free content online. Web publishers are giving you their content; advertisers agree to fund that content by paying for ads. And you agree to give mountains of personal data to hundreds of companies in the digital ad industry whether you realize it or not.

That’s the bargain that has funded free web publishing since the mid-1990s and for the past quarter century it’s been powered by a key piece of technology known as third-party cookies. These are tiny but crucial identifiers that track internet users’ every move across the web. They help advertisers target ads and measure the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns. They’ve become one of the central technologies underpinning the business model of publishing on the web.

And they’re about to die.

Safari and Firefox the world’s second and third most popular web browsers already block third-party cookies by default to protect users’ privacy. Google Chrome—which controls two-thirds of the global browser market—has announced it will follow suit by 2022. When Google pulls the plug next year almost no one will be left using a browser that supports third-party cookie tracking rendering it effectively extinct.

The death of third-party cookies comes at a moment of widespread backlash against advertisers’ digital surveillance. The public has become increasingly vocal about its discomfort with ad tracking. Europe’s landmark digital privacy laws have spawned copycats all over the world. Apple sensing an opportunity to market itself as the privacy-friendly tech giant has announced software updates that will make it much harder for advertisers to track what users do in apps and mobile browsers.

The internet is now at an inflection point. Industry groups representing advertisers advertising agencies browsers and publishers are scrambling to come up with alternatives to the old methods of invasive personal tracking. The decisions they reach over the next year will have widespread implications for the future of privacy on the web and how the businesses that operate on the internet carve up the spoils of the $336 billion industry of digital advertising.

It’s hard to overstate what hangs in the balance. “If we do it right” said Chetna Bindra who heads Google’s product team on trust and privacy “this will be the way to proactively shape the next couple of decades for a free and open web.”

Glossary

Publishers: Companies that create and host content online including news organizations and independent creators.

The “open” web: The universe of content that is free for anyone to access using a web browser—no one has to log in or pay a fee to see it.

Advertisement

Walled gardens: In this story this term mostly refers to companies that collect data on their websites that they won’t share with anyone (e.g. Facebook which has vast troves of data on its users that no one else can see). But in other contexts it can mean publishers that require users to log in or pay a fee to access content (e.g. Quartz which requires you to become a member to read this story).

Brands: The companies that buy ads to market their products or services. The biggest advertisers in the world include brands like Procter & Gamble Samsung and L’Oreal.

Agencies: The firms that brands hire to design and execute their marketing campaigns.

Adtech: A catchall term for the hundreds of companies that help connect brands which have ads they want to place with publishers who have ad space they want to sell. Adtech companies automate the process of buying and selling ad space track web users to help companies target the audiences they want to reach and measure how effectively a marketing campaign is getting people to spend money with a brand. Google is one of the world’s largest adtech companies but the group also includes smaller independent firms like The Trade Desk LiveRamp Criteo and ComScore.

Advertisement

Programmatic advertising: Ads bought through automated exchanges enabled by the adtech industry. There is no direct relationship between the brand and the publisher. Publishers sell space to the highest bidder and brands place ads targeted to particular audiences regardless of the publisher who hosts them. This accounts for a large portion of digital ad spending—85% in the US in 2020.

First-party data: The data internet users give directly to a company. If you go to a brand’s or publisher’s website everything you do and all the information you enter counts as first-party data. For publishers that might include what kinds of articles you like to read; for brands that might include what kinds of products you like to buy.

Third-party data: The data a company gets indirectly either by tracking you or buying it from someone else. There are companies that base their entire business on buying and selling data on internet users’ demographics location income and browsing history.

What is a third-party cookie?

A cookie is a small text file saved locally on a user’s computer at the behest of a website they’ve visited. It helps the website remember information about them—usually for benign reasons like remembering their login information or making sure the items in their shopping cart will still be there even if they close the page and come back later. Up until recently websites saved cookies on visitors’ computers automatically without ever notifying them. (In response to European privacy laws many websites now have pop-ups informing visitors that they use cookies.)

When cookies come directly from a website a user chose to visit they’re called first-party cookies. For example if a user goes to a weather website and types in their zip code to get their local forecast the site might save a cookie on their device. That way it will remember a user’s location—and offer the right forecast more quickly—the next time they visit.

When cookies come from someplace other than the website a user chose to visit they’re called third-party cookies. For example if a user goes to a website that displays an ad that ad might save a cookie on their computer that reports back to the advertiser. The cookie then marks them as the person who saw this particular ad at this particular moment. If at some point later they visit the advertiser’s website and buy something the company can infer that its marketing campaign influenced their decision and was effective.

The digital ad industry has learned many ways to use third-party cookies to its advantage. Ever notice that when you click on a product listing for a pair of pants ads for that particular pair of pants begin following you everywhere you go online? It may be because the retailer saved a cookie on your computer identifying you as a potential pants buyer. Ad vendors can also use cookies to keep track of the websites you’ve visited and link that information to massive third-party datasets on consumer incomes demographics or addresses. In this way a beauty brand might target ads for its products only to affluent women who live in geographic areas where the company operates.

We became a little bit dependent on third-party cookies because it was easier faster and required less planning and integration.

Advertisers began adopting third-party cookie tracking around the turn of the millennium because targeted ads promised to solve two of the industry’s perennial problems. First they offered a simpler way to reach the right audience at scale. Before cookies a brand might painstakingly cut deals with individual magazines TV channels or websites based on their inferences about how likely it was that Golf Digest readers would be in the market for a new watch. Now brands can just say they want to reach wealthy middle-aged men who have browsed fashion websites in the past month and cookie trackers will attempt to find those men anywhere they happen to be around the internet.

“We became a little bit dependent on third-party cookies because it was easier faster and required less planning and integration [than traditional marketing]” said Matt Naeger who heads US strategy for the performance marketing agency Merkle.

Cookies also promised to bring some scientific rigor to the advertising process. Agencies could analyze cookie data and calculate how much revenue a particular marketing campaign generated. In fact an entire sub-industry dedicated to “performance marketing” now promises its clients clear returns on their investment based on rock-solid data. The allure of these precise figures stands in contrast to the traditional ad model in which brands simply have faith that their investments in marketing would eventually bring in customers.

In reality however third-party cookies haven’t turned out to be the omniscient crystal balls they promised to be. Even before ad blockers (which also block tracking cookies) consumers had a pesky habit of clearing their cookie caches and sharing a browser with other members of their household leaving the data noisy and incomplete. To further muddy the waters the internet is awash in bots designed to fabricate ad traffic to generate billions of dollars in fraudulent revenue for nefarious publishers and adtech vendors. Today cookies are rather lousy proxies for a consumer’s identity. When one adtech vendor tries to match the cookie data it has on a given audience to another vendor’s cookie data on those same people the accuracy rate tends to hover between 40% and 60%—a major challenge for advertisers who want to track individuals around the web.

Peer-reviewed academic research has struggled to find evidence that cookie-based tracking actually makes advertising more effective according to Arslan Aziz an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia business school who wrote the 2016 paper “What Is a Digital Cookie Worth?” His study found that under the right circumstances ads that use cookie tracking could make a person 2.7% more likely to make a purchase than ads that don’t. But he said other studies have been more equivocal. “Frankly the research is not conclusive about whether these ads do add value” he said.

Adtech firms however have been very successful at convincing brands that tracking is worth the investment. “We know from basically just looking at the industry that advertisers do spend a lot of money on [ad targeting] and that translates into revenues for all these big tech firms that work on advertising and all these other players in the ecosystem” Aziz said. “So there is a lot of money being spent. Now whether it creates a lot of value but it’s difficult to measure or it doesn’t create any value I feel it’s still not fully answered in research.”

Timeline

1994: Lou Montulli a 23-year-old engineer at the world’s then-leading web browser Netscape invents the cookie. His original goal was to create a tool that would help websites remember users—but couldn’t be used for cross-site tracking.

1995: DoubleClick one of the world’s first adtech firms is founded. Its engineers realize they can exploit cookies to track users across the web; the company pioneers and comes to dominate the world of ad targeting.

1996: The press starts reporting on cookie tracking in advertising prompting public backlash. At Netscape the decision about whether to ban third-party cookies falls to Montulli who decides to spare them. Netscape however gives users full power to clear their cookie cache or delete cookies from specific websites which other browsers later emulate.

1998: The US Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability issues a bulletin assuring the web-browsing public that “the vulnerability of systems to damage or snooping by using Web browser cookies is essentially nonexistent.”

Advertisement

2008: Google buys DoubleClick for $3.1 billion and expands its advertising business from search pages to programmatic ads on websites.

2011: The European Union issues an ePrivacy Directive enshrining individuals’ right to refuse cookies.

2016: The EU passes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which expands requirements for websites to get users’ consent before tracking them with cookies.

Sept. 2017: Safari starts blocking some third-party cookies through the first iteration of its Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) protocol.

April 2018: Citing GDPR Google blocks adtech companies from accessing DoubleClick data strengthening its grip on a walled garden of user data.

Oct. 2018: Firefox rolls out “Enhanced Tracking Protection” features that block third-party cookies but these are switched off by default.

Aug. 2019: Google Chrome announces its “Privacy Sandbox” initiative to develop and test new browser features that would boost user privacy.

Sept. 2019: Firefox blocks all third-party cookies by default.

Jan. 2020: Google announces it will block all third-party cookies by default writing “Our intention is to do this within two years.”

March 2020: Safari blocks all third-party cookies by default.

Why are third-party cookies going away?

The immediate cause of death for third-party cookies was Google Chrome’s decision to stop supporting them. But Google’s decision was really a recognition of the reality that cookie-based tracking had suffered a swift and irreversible fall from grace. At this point there are few people left in the ad industry willing to defend—or invest in—third-party cookie tracking.

First public opinion turned negative. A major catalyst for change was Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal—which ironically had nothing to do with cookies. But after the news broke in 2018 that a third-party analytics company had improperly accessed Facebook users’ data in an attempt to psychologically manipulate voters and sway elections the media cast a harsh spotlight on the ways tech companies harvest and exploit data. Public awareness of and opposition to tracking grew. On top of that a steady drumbeat of headlines about massive data breaches undermined the public’s faith that the companies that collect data could be trusted to protect it.

When laying out its justification for nixing third-party cookies Google cited public opinion polling from Pew Research Center showing that 72% of Americans worry that almost all of what they do online is being tracked by advertisers tech firms and other companies; 81% believe the risks they face from having their data collected outweigh the benefits. Pew has also found that half of Americans have chosen not to use a product or service (mainly websites electronics and social media platforms) because they worried about how much personal data it would collect about them.

Souring public opinion spurred regulation. Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation law passed in 2016 and quickly became the template for similar privacy regulations around the world. The new rules restricted the use of cookie tracking by requiring companies to obtain opt-in consent from users before saving cookies on their computers. The laws also convinced companies that more regulation could be on the horizon and it was a good time to take some proactive steps to preserve privacy and appease lawmakers.

Apple sought to claim a competitive advantage by positioning itself as a privacy-first consumer tech company. Safari which has blocked some forms of third-party cookies since 2017 completely banned them in 2020. Apple has also said it will release a software update in “early spring” 2021 that will require advertisers to ask for permission before tracking iOS users’ activity on mobile devices. The update is expected to limit the industry’s use of Apple’s “Identifier for Advertisers” which plays a similar role to cookies on mobile devices.

Apple’s privacy moves were inspired by Firefox’s 2019 decision to block all third-party cookies by default and coincided with the rise of ad blockers third-party extensions that allow users to swat down tracking cookies even on browsers like Chrome. Thanks to Firefox Safari and ad blockers roughly 40% of US web traffic now comes from users who block third-party cookies reducing cookies’ utility to advertisers.

This whole thing has helped us all to rethink what data matters.

As public backlash regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressure rose advertisers started to take a closer look at the adtech business model that third-party cookies were propping up. Advertisers’ reliance on tracking data had created an elaborate industry of hundreds of adtech firms each using third-party cookies to facilitate a niche part of the process of buying and selling digital ads. A 2018 analysis from the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) found that agencies and adtech middlemen—who connect brands buying ads to publishers selling ad space—absorbed roughly half the revenue from programmatic advertising (confirming earlier findings from the World Federation of Advertisers and the US Association of National Advertisers).

Worse the digital ad industry was so opaque that almost none of the advertisers the ISBA reached out to could fully audit their spending. In the industry group’s analysis 15% of ad spending seemed to simply disappear. No one could account for where it went or who pocketed it.

Against this backdrop Google announced in Jan. 2020 that it would stop supporting third-party cookies within two years. Initially industry groups like the US Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies grumbled in press releases that they were “disappointed that Google would unilaterally declare such a major change” and worried that the move would “threaten to substantially disrupt much of the infrastructure of today’s Internet.”

But they quickly fell in line and embraced the change. In roughly 30 recent interviews with representatives from brands agencies adtech firms publishers privacy watchdogs and academia not one person mourned the third-party cookie. Stephan Pretorius chief technology officer at UK-based WPP the world’s biggest ad agency gave a representative response: “I’m not particularly sad about the demise of third-party cookies because they were never really that accurate never really that useful and in fact I think this whole thing has helped us all to rethink what data matters” he said.

What will replace third-party cookies?

There are three major proposals for how the industry can continue to show consumers relevant ads and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns without relying on third-party cookies. Google is championing a browser-based tracking model; publishers and brands are developing ad models that rely on their own first-party data; and some parts of the adtech industry are pushing for a new form of identity-based tracking that would bear some similarities to the cookies of yore.

These solutions aren’t mutually exclusive and at least in the short term we’ll see the industry experiment with all three.

Google’s browser-based model

How it works: The browser would collect information about what a user does online and save that data locally on their computer. Based on the websites they visited and the content they saw the browser would assign them to a cohort alongside several thousand people with similar interests. Then every time that person visits a website their browser would tell the site which cohort they belong to and advertisers would show them ads tailored to people with interests like theirs. The cohorts would update every week to keep ad targeting relevant and make it harder to identify the members of each group.

Who’s working on it: Google Chrome is currently testing a version of this which it calls the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) model. Chrome engineers are hammering out the details of how it should work with representatives from ad agencies publishers and adtech firms who meet regularly as part of a working group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) an industry group that sets technical standards for web browsers. No other browser has publicly indicated it is working on a similar model.

Advertisement

Stage of development: In beta testing. Google says that 0.5% of users in Australia Brazil Canada India Indonesia Japan Mexico New Zealand the Philippines and the United States are part of its initial “origin trial.” (Europe was not included for fear that the trial might violate GDPR.) If you’re a Chrome user in one of those countries you can check if you’re part of the trial.

How it improves privacy: FLoC has two privacy-preserving features. First all tracking data is saved locally on a user’s computer—it never gets collected in a central server and it can’t be resold to third parties. Second advertisers never see specific information about an individual user; they only see aggregated information about a group of thousands of users in the same cohort.

Caveat: FLoC wouldn’t change the fact that Chrome users’ every move online is being logged and tracked—it would just make it harder to tie that data back to an individual. (But as the privacy-focused Electronic Frontier Foundation points out that doesn’t stop advertisers from trying to de-anonymize consumers through a practice called “fingerprinting” which some adtech companies already use to track people.)

How it would affect the ad industry: In this model all tracking targeting and measurement runs through the browser. No one else has access to the underlying data giving the browser a tremendous amount of control over the digital ad market.

Who wins: Google. The company can legitimately claim it boosted user privacy while also consolidating its grip on web advertising.

Who loses: Adtech vendors especially those who run independent ad exchanges or rely on granular individual-level user tracking.

First-party data tracking

How it works: Publishers collect their own first-party data about their audience which might include information about the content they’re viewing the kinds of topics they tend to be interested in and possibly survey responses about their interests and demographics. They can use this data to divide their audience into segments and sell ad space to advertisers who want to target those segments. Meanwhile brands also collect their own first-party data about their customers’ shopping habits. If a brand and a publisher have the same piece of information about a particular user—say they both know their email address or phone number—they can team up to match the customer’s spending habits on the brand’s site to their reading habits on the publisher’s site and target ads even more effectively. Note that these kinds of partnerships require direct deals between brands and publishers who have to set up complicated technical systems that make the ad targeting work without revealing brand’s data to the publisher or the publisher’s data to the brand.

Who’s working on it: Large-scale publishers like the New York Times Vox Media and Insider have already launched their own ad targeting systems based on first-party data. The Local Media Consortium is working on a massive partnership between 5000 US-based local news outlets to build a first-party data system that would sell ad space across all their websites in an effort to match the scale of the big publishers. (Quartz which makes money from both ads and memberships has its own first-party data strategy.)

Stage of development: Several large publishers are already using them while the Local Media Consortium is beginning to pilot its proposed ad network.

How it improves privacy: Instead of being tracked by third parties they don’t know consumers give their data directly to publishers and brands. Ideally this creates a clear “value exchange” in which consumers knowingly and voluntarily give up their data in exchange for free content discounts or other incentives.

Caveats: Consumers may not be fully aware of when their data is being collected and what happens with it afterward. When someone gives a publisher their email address and agrees to receive marketing emails in exchange for free articles the terms of the deal are obvious. But it’s less clear that consumers are thinking about handing over data for advertising every time they make a purchase or log into a website. Plus companies can make deals with third-party data vendors to “enrich” the first-party data they get from consumers—a process that allows them to match the users in their first-party database with information the third-party vendor has about their homes their cars their incomes their demographics their credit histories and so on for ad targeting purposes. (Vice has struck a partnership along these lines with credit agency Experian.) Consumers in other words may be giving away access to a lot more information than they realize.

How it would affect the ad industry: First-party data comes with fewer headaches around complying with privacy regulations and managing user consent. But first-party data is also much harder to get than third-party cookie data. Under this model the ad world would have to learn how to make do with less information about consumers.

Advertisement

Who wins: The biggest publishers with access to the largest pools of first-party data could wind up making more money under this model by cutting direct ad deals with brands. Also brands that have access to lots of consumer data e.g. direct-to-consumer brands would gain a marketing advantage over brands that have no direct relationships with consumers.

Who loses: Smaller publishers who don’t have as much first-party data and lack the scale they’d need to secure ad deals with major brands. Also brands that haven’t invested in collecting consumer data through direct-to-consumer sales subscriptions loyalty programs newsletters etc.

Identity-based tracking

How it works: A central authority would assign every web user an advertising ID based on a trait that isn’t likely to change very often like their email address. Every time a user logs into a website with their email address advertisers could identify and track them using their specific ID. Adtech companies would once again be able to monitor individual users’ browsing habits serve them targeted ads and measure whether a user who saw an ad went on to buy the advertised product. If enough of the ad industry agreed to use this form of ID tracking and more websites started requiring users to log in with an email address the digital ad world could return to a system for targeting ads that would look something like the cookie-based system we have today.

Who’s working on it: The Trade Desk one of the web’s leading adtech companies has developed the most prominent proposal which it calls Unified ID 2.0. It has gotten buy-in from a slew of adtech companies and industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab and the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media (PRAM) which are developing technical standards for identity-based tracking.

Advertisement

Stage of development: In beta testing.

How it improves privacy: User IDs would be encrypted so advertisers wouldn’t see a person’s email address—they’d just see a random string of characters that correspond to that email address. The IAB Tech Lab has also proposed creating a “Global Privacy Platform” which would help the companies that use Unified ID 2.0 offer consumers a way to opt out of ad tracking. It wouldn’t create a universal opt-out button however—consumers would still have to opt out of tracking from each company individually.

Caveats: In reality people just don’t use opt-out menus. It’s not clear how many consumers would know the opt-outs existed or go to the trouble of finding them and fidgeting with their privacy options.

How it would affect the ad industry: The ad industry wouldn’t have to change their business practices very much after third-party cookies fade away maintaining the status quo. Advertisers wouldn’t be able to collect as much data as they did with cookies but the data would be more reliable because it would come from logged-in users. But critics worry this solution wouldn’t sufficiently address consumers’ or regulators’ privacy concerns and would leave the industry open to a renewed backlash.

Advertisement

Who wins: Adtech vendors whose business models depend on granular tracking and who worry about the market power of Google and Facebook. Smaller publishers who rely heavily on programmatic advertising and don’t want to have yet another business model change foisted upon them.

Who loses: Potentially the digital ad industry if fed up consumers and regulators believe this solution doesn’t go far enough and they turn their ire on advertisers.

The other alternative would be for the industry to move away from tracking and back toward old-school marketing methods. Instead of targeting ads to individual users brands could return to contextual advertising in which they place ads in publications or next to stories with relevant content. Instead of following users around the web to see if they eventually buy a product after seeing it in an ad marketers could rely on last-click attribution—an imperfect way of measuring an ad’s effectiveness by simply observing how many people click on it and whether those clicks lead to sales. Both tactics can be imprecise but they don’t require cookies or any cookie alternatives.

In other words the industry could let go of its preoccupation with measuring everything and operate the way it did before the internet: with a lot less data and a lot more faith that good marketing will eventually carry the day. Naeger the Merkle ad executive said the industry has lost sight of the basics of building a brand and maintaining relationships with customers. “The first job you have is to be a real marketer” he said. “The second job you have is to take advantage of the tools and technologies that allow you to do it in a faster and easier way.”

Who gets to decide what will replace third-party cookies?

There are hundreds of players in the digital ad world who all have a hand in deciding which cookie alternatives the industry will adopt. But three main power centers have emerged with outsized influence over the future of tracking on the web.

Google

Google is working on standards for browser-based tracking through the W3C’s Improving Web Advertising Business Group. The 355-member group is theoretically supposed to be collaborative and make decisions based on consensus among all its stakeholders who represent browsers ad agencies adtech firms and publishers. But it’s hard to find common ground with so many competing interests at the table.

“It’s hard to point to something that everyone agrees on” said Wendy Seltzer the W3C’s legal counsel strategy lead and chair of the advertising working group. “When I’ve tried to suggest points of agreement even around the basics—we’re trying to work on solutions that improve privacy and opportunities for monetization—I get pushback from some group participants.”

Advertisement

It’s hard to point to something that everyone agrees on.

Absent any consensus it’s unlikely the group will come up with standards for browser-based tracking by 2022. That frees up Google—which never needed the W3C’s permission in the first place—to forge ahead with its own vision for FLoC. Jochen Schlosser the chief technology officer at the adtech company Adform and a participant in the W3C working group says the meetings have started to feel like a Google-led show-and-tell.

“It’s not a conversation” he said. “It’s not about trying to be creative together or trying to find a compromise. This is about someone doing a show and then taking feedback and then saying ‘Thank you for listening. It was great having you.’” Schlosser has stopped attending the meetings and instead sends someone in his place to take notes on Google’s latest updates.

Bindra the Google privacy lead says Google remains committed to collaborating with its peers on the W3C. She points out that Chrome’s latest prototype—a tool for replacing digital ad auctions that it calls FLEDGE—incorporates some of the extensive feedback the company got from the working group. But the end product does bear a lot of similarities to Google’s original proposal.

Large publishers

The largest web publishers aren’t convening industry groups to develop shared standards to govern their first-party ad targeting software. Many saw the writing on the wall when GDPR passed in 2016 and started developing their own ad platforms soon after.

So far it seems to have been working—at least for publishers with the largest audiences. Jana Meron who leads Insider’s programmatic advertising and data strategy says the publisher has been able to keep significantly more of its ad revenue by signing direct deals with brands based on first-party data. Schlosser the Adform CTO says that a “double digit percentage” of traffic on his company’s ad network now comes from publishers who use first-party data for ad targeting. “We’ve had no complaints about their performance so I think that proves first-party solutions are already working” he said.

The Trade Desk & the IAB Tech Lab

Despite pushback from some parts of the industry The Trade Desk is moving ahead with Unified ID 2.0. The IAB Tech Lab is in talks to take on the role of overseeing the tracking system and has put out a set of standards for how Unified ID 2.0 should be governed. Industry groups including the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media and the American Association of Advertising Agencies have tentatively expressed an interest in the new tracking protocol.

The big remaining hurdle is getting the rest of the ad world onboard. The more brands agencies adtech firms and publishers use Unified ID 2.0 the more comprehensive its ability to track users across the web will become—and in theory the more useful it will be to advertisers. But some players worry that adopting a new form of identity-based tracking will just set off another wave of public outcry over privacy.

In March 2021 Google threw up a roadblock for Unified ID 2.0 when it declared that it would not support identity-based tracking in its ad products. “We don’t believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment” the company wrote in a blog post.

Some publishers have echoed the sentiment. Megan Walton who heads Vox Media’s ad tech team said identity-based tracking is ineffective and short-sighted. “We don’t think that’s the future out of how advertising will be transacted and we think that’s not the correct strategy” she said. Pranay Prabhat who heads digital ad technology at The New York Times agreed. “I don’t think that’s the future” he said.

Still there are a couple of major publishers who have shown support for Unified ID 2.0. The Washington Post became the first publisher to agree to test the tracking system for ad targeting on its site and The Trade Desk lists Buzzfeed and Newsweek as collaborators on the project.

What will the outcome of all this be?

No matter how the battle to select third-party cookies’ replacement shakes out we can expect two major outcomes: modest privacy gains for users and increased consolidation in the digital ad market.

Consolidation

The clearest beneficiaries from the death of third-party cookies are the web’s walled gardens especially Google and Facebook who have vast pools of data about users and their browsing habits that no one else can access. There’s also room for Amazon to become the third ad industry titan since it controls its own walled garden full of rich data on consumer spending habits. Over the past several years the ecommerce giant has been steadily growing its ad marketplace which now accounts for 10.3% of the US digital advertising.

Adtech vendors on the other hand are shut out of all this information. When third-party cookie tracking goes away they won’t have their own walled gardens full of data to fall back on. Many of their business models which rely on collecting and analyzing vast troves of user data won’t work anymore. Larger adtech vendors will be able to pivot to new supporting roles in an industry that relies more on FLoC cohorts and highly technical first-party data partnerships—but smaller adtech firms may struggle to keep the lights on as they try to find a new niche.

The same is true for publishers. Bigger publishers may be able to boost their revenues by charging more for ads that use first-party data to target their large audiences. But smaller publishers are less likely to have the developers on staff who can build out a first-party data offering the sales people who can knock on brands’ doors to offer direct ad deals or the scale that would make it worth it for a brand to cut deals with them individually.

Advertisement

It’s possible that small publishers can band together in partnerships like the NewsNext program envisioned by the Local Media Consortium to pool resources and build their own ad offering based on first-party data. Otherwise they’ll have to hope that cookie alternatives like FLoC and Unified ID 2.0 continue delivering programmatic ad revenue after third-party cookies get phased out. If not they’ll have to find ways to make up for lost income such as boosting subscription rates.

At least marginally better privacy

Any of the proposed alternatives will offer more privacy protections than the status quo in which hundreds of adtech companies surreptitiously used third-party cookies to collect mountains of data about users without their knowledge or consent. But it’s unclear whether the cookie alternatives will offer anything more than a small step in the right direction.

FLoC promises to hide users’ identities in large anonymous groups but advertisers could use fingerprinting to de-anonymize FLoC cohorts. Unified ID 2.0 promises to come with opt-out buttons but few people actually take advantage of opt-outs. First-party data promises to be the gold standard in which users knowingly and voluntarily give their data directly to a publisher or brand in exchange for content a discount or something else they value. But consumers may not fully understand the implications of giving away their data.

The biggest privacy gain to come out of the industry’s switch to cookie alternatives may be the disruptions that it causes. Whatever comes next will likely throw a wrench in what used to be a relatively smooth data collecting operation—which ran quietly enough in the background that most users didn’t have to think about the fact that it was happening. The transition may require companies to ask users for their consent to give up their data more often. It may require users to click through more obtrusive privacy pop-ups. It will probably create more friction at least in the short term in the experience of using the internet.

But that friction will create awareness. It will force users to more frequently face the fact that they are being tracked by advertisers. And it will force advertisers to be a little more transparent about why they’re asking users to hand over their data. The industry believes it’s ready for that moment of honesty—and that it has a convincing sales pitch that can win over consumers.

The third-party cookies didn’t really transparently explain the value exchange…[adtech] did a bad job of telling that story to consumers.

“The internet is this amazing offering where you have essentially unlimited content—news entertainment political views social networking sites—available to consumers that never before have existed and all of it is mostly free. And that is powered by advertising” said Travis Clinger vice president for addressiblity at the adtech firm LiveRamp.

If you explain that to people Clinger and many of his peers believe they’ll get why companies need to target ads to them to fund web publishing. They’ll be willing to barter their data for the bounty of the internet. It’s just that no one has ever clearly laid out the terms of the deal to them. “The third-party cookies didn’t really transparently explain the value exchange and I think that’s on adtech” Clinger said. “We did a bad job of telling that story to consumers.”

Consumers will not escape tracking as a result of the ongoing changes in the digital ad industry. This is after all an attempt at self-regulation from an industry that has convinced itself rightly or wrongly that it needs extensive user data to generate value—so there’s no way it will create a new system that doesn’t give advertisers access to plenty of user data. Changing that fundamental reality would require government intervention.

But the industry may at least become a little more transparent about the terms of the deal it’s striking with consumers. And consumers in turn may be a little better equipped to make decisions about when to trade their data away.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTM2MjE5Nzg4L3NoYWRvdy1hbmQtYm9uZS1zZXh1YWwtY29uc2VudC1hbGluYS1raXJpZ2FuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shadow and Bone star on how sexual consent changed relationship,"Shadow and Bone spoilers follow.

Shadow and Bone star Ben Barnes has spoken out about how important it was to make a change from the original book for the new Netflix TV adaptation of the story.

Shadow and Bone focuses on the heroic Alina Starkov who becomes entwined with the powerful but dark General Kirigan – also known as 'The Darkling'. Although at first Alina sees Kirigan as a kindred spirit who can help her to hone her magical powers it becomes clear that he has some secret ulterior motives for taking her under his wing as he actually wants to use her powers to help him take control of the Fold.

In Leigh Bardugo's original novel Kirigan takes Alina by surprise by kissing her and they later seem to come close to having sex. However in the Netflix adaptation it is Alina (Jessie Mei Li) who makes the first move on Kirigan (Barnes) – and he later asks her ""Are you sure?"" when things get passionate between them.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter actor Barnes revealed that there were some important discussions behind the scenes about how to play the passionate moments between Alina and Kirigan.

""There was definitely discussion about that – that if she kisses him it gives Alina more agency. And I said 'But does it?'"" he said. ""Because we've been paying attention the last couple of years and it gives her the semblance of agency but she's still an orphan who doesn't really understand the rules with this man who is willing to burn things to the ground and is manipulating his power.""



The actor who has also starred in The Punisher added that it was he who wanted to add a hesitation from Kirigan into his and Alina's passionate scene revealing that he wanted viewers to question how much agency Alina has in the situation.

""My contribution was during the steamiest moment in the book and in the show where I throw Alina on the table"" he explained. ""I wanted to add something which ended up being 'Are you sure?'

""It doesn't solve anything. He's a problematic character no matter which angle you look at him from. He's unforgivable and uncondonable in his abuses of power. But I wanted to flag that as a theme worth exploring for them because it makes it relevant.

""It's a catalyst for discussion about whether she does have agency in this moment and whether we're making our own choices and whether there's any room for understanding between them given that he might really have feelings for her.

""And it was very important to me to bring something of myself to the moment before it's revealed that he's as manipulative as he is. As an actor I have to come up with ways to forgive him and motivate his choices.""

Barnes expanded on this idea while speaking to TVLine saying that Kirigan's relationship with Alina is clearly ""problematic"" due to the imbalance of power between them.

""He's at the top of the food chain [in] the hierarchy of the world and he manipulates and abuses his power in order to make her do his bidding essentially"" he said. ""He tries to convince her of his ideologies along the way and tries to share with her as much as he feels he can but he's a mistrustful person.""

The phrase has been part of fanfiction communities for the better part of the last decade but it gained mainstream traction on TikTok in the past month. The tag #Omegaverse has over 357 million views on TikTok and corresponding keywords like alpha omega and beta have racked up views in the millions as well.

It's garnered enough online attention that in a recent video with 66800 likes TikTok user 420sadbtch69 forewarned their followers ""One of these days BuzzFeed or Vice or something's gonna come up with an article being like 'Alpha Beta Omega: Here's a guide to Gen Z's Secondary Genders.""

With excruciating self-awareness here is an explainer on the Omegaverse for a hapless millennial trying to understand yet another TikTok trend.

The Omegaverse explained

The Omegaverse is an alternate universe (AU) of speculative erotic fiction that started in the Supernatural fandom. Smut fics are notoriously nonvanilla and beyond being extremely graphic Omegaverse fics have been criticized for depictions of assault and sexual violence because much of it revolves around nonconsensual mating and forced birth. Fics within the Omegaverse often depict feral sex scenes between two male characters whose ""secondary sex"" is assigned as ""Alpha"" or ""Omega.""

Within this universe characters are categorized as ""Alphas"" ""Betas"" and ""Omegas"" which is why stories within the Omegaverse are also known as A/B/O fics. Per this thorough guide by Wattpad author Velvelyami Alphas are the highest ranking in this fictional universe's lupine hierarchy and whether male female or any other gender are typically characterized by dominance and aggression. No matter their gender Alphas impregnate others but cannot be impregnated themselves.

Betas are essentially humans and are subject to the same biological functions like menstruation but typically are not paired with either Alphas or Omegas. Some fics characterize them as ""peacemakers"" between the two according to online encyclopedia Fanlore and others exclude them from storylines entirely.

Omegas are the lowest in this fictional hierarchy and can be impregnated regardless of gender. The genre often crosses over with internet subculture ""mpreg"" which revolves around male characters getting pregnant. They're typically characterized as submissive to Alphas and in many stories have little to no agency in A/O relationships. Some fics that take place in the Omegaverse also include ""Deltas"" and ""Gammas"" who fall somewhere between Alphas and Omegas in sexual aggression.

If you think that's a lot to take in then you may want to take a break from reading before we get into the mechanics of A/B/O mating.

Most of the themes in the Omegaverse take from mating habits of pack animals and typically portray a primal need for sex. Desire is cyclical; Alphas experience a ""rut"" sometimes induced by the scent of an Omega in ""heat."" And yes that pained me to write as much as it hurt you to read it.

As Wattpad author loveforpreserumsteve explained in ""So You Wanna Learn About Alphas Betas and Omegas: Handbook to the Omegaverse"" an Alpha will mark an Omega by biting them to mark ownership and ""mix scents."" Again regardless of gender Alphas impregnate Omegas via a phallic external gland referred to as a ""knot"" the structure of which is often described in thorough detail.

Within this universe characters can experience ""omegapause"" a menopause-like end to their fertility and ""rut leave"" a personal leave from work or school to go off and fulfill their insatiable desire to mate. Some fics will include ""heat suppressants"" birth control-like medications that prevent characters from experiencing the need to mate or emanating a scent.

Again it's a lot.

Why is the Omegaverse big right now?

Staple concepts of the Omegaverse originated in an early Star Trek episode about Vulcan mating practices: If a Vulcan male didn't mate during this biological cycle he'd die. That inspired Star Trek slash fics between Spock and various members of his ship's crew and nearly 50 years later inspired the Omegaverse trope in Supernatural fanfiction.

It's been applied to a multitude of fandoms since; there are nearly 20000 Omegaverse stories on the fic site Archive of Our Own over 1000 on WattPad and countless discussions about it on Tumblr. The popularity of the Omegaverse — and the largely crowdsourced world-building applied to these fics — even sparked a legal battle between two writers who both published books adapted from A/B/O fics over similar storylines.

Videos referencing the Omegaverse began appearing on TikTok as early as spring 2020 and while those videos gained hundreds of thousands of views they stayed within the fanfiction community that was already familiar with the concept.

Many TikTok users were likely first exposed to Omegaverse fics when enthusiasts posted videos referencing it like TikTok user latocino. In a November 2020 video that now has 472600 likes latocino recommended a gay manga (known as yaoi) called ""12 Zodiac Boys"" and tagged it #omegaverse. Despite narrating the video in Spanish latocino's enthusiasm for the genre transcends language barriers.

""I have no clue what is being said but I have never been so sold to watch something before"" one TikTok user commented.

""I cant undertsand (sic) but she literally has me sold on reading this"" another replied.

Outside of fanfiction and manga enthusiast accounts a video posted around the same time as latocino's reminded TikTok users of the Omegaverse fic copyright lawsuit.

""If you're having a bad day just remember that real judges and lawyers had to learn the ins and outs of wolf erotica"" TikTok user godofsparklingwater said in a video that now has 115500 likes. ""So that they could determine whether or not a particular piece of wolf erotica was copyright infringement or not.""

The trope took over users' For You Pages by force during Ramadan in 2021 when Muslim creators jokingly questioned the practice of mating during the holiday since sex is forbidden while fasting. In what appears to be the first video about the subject creator omarsbigsister posted a TikTok captioned ""when it's Ramadan so you can't breed your favorite omega anymore.""

Thanks to TikTok's algorithmically generated For You Page which queues up content related to videos you've already engaged with TikTok users' For You Pages were flooded with Omegaverse content.

""I kid you not when I say my For You Page has been riddled with Muslim...Omegaverse TikToks"" user kireiparks said in a stitched video to omarsbigsister. ""I'm not Muslim and I don't know what the Omegaverse is. I don't know how I got here. I'm lost.""

And as with most memes du jour the more absurd the concept the more likely it is to go viral. Since omarsbigsister posted that video content about the Omegaverse has boomed on TikTok.

Some creators frame Omegaverse discourse like social justice discussions from advocating for Omega autonomy to asking for more Beta representation in media. In a call out video barely holding back laughter user cancatcan reminded another TikTok user that Betas don't ""understand the struggle that Alphas and Omegas have to go through every month just because they were born a certain way."" In another video user xiaostrophywife poked fun at religious conservative's disapproval of birth control but with Omegaverse heat suppressants.

Ok but isn't the Omegaverse kind of problematic?

It's complicated.

Anne Jamison who authored the 2013 book Fic: Why Fanfiction Is Taking Over the World described the Omegaverse as both ""pure porn without plot"" and also a collection of stories that ""develop very complex political worlds with tension around issues of passing hormone suppression consent and Omega rights.""

Before it blew up on TikTok fanfiction writers and readers did have genuine discussions regarding consent and bodily autonomy within Omegaverse fics. A 2016 Tumblr post described a legal system within the Omegaverse that punishes Alphas for mating with Omegas without consent but much like in our world non-consenting Omegas are still subject to shaming.

""False claims are extremely rare but some lawyers like to use the false claim theory to defend their client"" the OP wrote regarding forced mating.

Another Tumblr post from 2018 emphasized the importance of consent when marking a mate within the Omegaverse describing the act as an almost sacred ritual. To bite someone against their will the Tumblr user wrote is a ""serious crime"" that can be punished with life imprisonment.

""Some people in-universe would be even capable of arguing that mating is an immoral act on itself because of its intrusive nature"" they said.

Despite some enthusiasts trying to shape this fictional universe to be more progressive explicit violent stories within the genre prevail. Still responses to those fics may open up larger discussions about power imbalances and the ability to consent.

A paper written by Milena Popova for the Digital Cultures Research Center at the University of the West of England uses the Omegaverse to analyze the impact of power structures in intimate relationships. Popova uses three Omegaverse fics to analyze the ways partners with innately less power may communicate (or not communicate) their non-consent to sexual activity and the discussions that followed the fics' publications.

""They clearly problematize issues of power and consent and offer ways of negotiating meaningful consensual intimate relationships within wider abusive social structures"" Popova wrote.

Beyond discussing consent Omegaverse fics also provide a platform to explore aspects of gender and sexuality. One Tumblr user irate at the fact that the Omegaverse has become the butt of online jokes posted that the genre is particularly popular among women and trans people because of the way it plays with gender norms. The canine dynamics are a metaphor they wrote for ""navigating identity and sex and relationships in a world where the people you desire and the kind of sex you get off on are part of a system that oppresses you politically and your own biology is at once the instrument through which you live and achieve sexual fulfillment and a weapon that can be used against you.""

As foreign and strange it may be the Omegaverse's popularity — and the fantastical smutty fics written within it — is sure to endure through another decade of the internet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vbGVnaW9ucy1maWdodGluZy1mb3ItZ2FkYWZmaS1tYXktaGF2ZS1qb2luZWQtYm9rby1oYXJhbS1nZW4tcm9sZS1leC1nb2Mv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9wdW5jaG5nLmNvbS9sZWdpb25zLWZpZ2h0aW5nLWZvci1nYWRhZmZpLW1heS1oYXZlLWpvaW5lZC1ib2tvLWhhcmFtLWdlbi1yb2xlLWV4LWdvYy8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Legions fighting for Gadaffi may have joined Boko Haram — Gen Role ex-GOC,"A former General Officer Commanding 1 Division of the Nigerian Army Major General Abiodun Role (retd) tells JESUSEGUN ALAGBE how the death of Chadian President Idriss Déby will not affect the fight against Boko Haram the consequences of attacks on police formations in the South-East and amnesty for bandits among other things

There are certain commentaries that the death of Chadian President Idriss Déby will affect Nigeria’s offensive against Boko Haram considering that the late ruler was a major supporter of the anti-terrorism war. How do you think his death will affect the anti-Boko Haram war?

Well if a military commander dies in the battlefront we won’t say the battle should not go on because the commander has died. In the case with Chad someone has already taken over and he will carry on. It’s an unfortunate loss; he died gallantly in battle trying to ensure rebels don’t take over his country. Definitely we will miss his immense contribution towards decimating the Boko Haram insurgency.

Do you think Déby’s son General Mahamat will follow in the footsteps of his father by supporting Nigeria’s war against Boko Haram?

It’s too early to start insinuating what his son would do. I don’t want to join those insinuating what the son would do or not do.

Actually the fears are that the reopened Chadian borders may lead to the smuggling of arms into Nigeria just like with the case with Libya when Muammar Gaddafi was killed. Are these situations similar?

These are two different situations. The deaths of Gaddafi and Déby are actually two different scenarios. The legions fighting for Gaddafi were made of mostly non-Libyans and rebel factions. And when he died the Libyans disbanded the unit. Most of the fighters were from the Sahel region mostly Chadians Tuaregs Nigeriens Sudanese and others. So after the unit was disbanded they all dispersed and migrated to many places and because they had been used to fighting battles it is not impossible that many of them joined Boko Haram. But the situation with Chad is different. We know we have porous borders but the Chadian troops are likely to do more on the offensive knowing that it is the action of the rebels that led to their leader’s death. No country will just sit down and watch and not do anything against the rebel group that was responsible.

There is a belief in some quarters that Boko Haram terrorists metamorphosed into bandits now attacking schools and kidnapping schoolchildren in many northern states. Do you think so too?

There is really no evidence that Boko Haram elements have transformed into bandits. If the activities of Boko Haram and bandits are anything to go by which is to raise money we can only say probably one is copying the tactic of the other. If we have Boko Haram who kidnapped large numbers of schoolchildren for money and now we have bandits doing the same I think they are just sharing similar tactics.

As a retired major general what should the country be doing to decimate banditry attacks?

When you have a multidimensional situation like this the approach can’t be unidirectional. It’s no longer only the security agencies’ responsibility but everybody’s to stop the attacks. Most of the issues that brought all of these are politically motivated. And now that the outcome has become injurious to virtually everyone we need to apply all dimensions – political military and others. Even media has a role to play in stopping the attacks. When the media publicises the bandits’ attacks so much the bandits enjoy it and this emboldens them to do more. At the same time I understand the media has the responsibility to report. But giving so much space to people wreaking havoc on the country is indirectly emboldening them.

If the media doesn’t report the attacks as they occur don’t you think it may let the government relax in tackling banditry?

No I’m not saying the media should not report. But they should not propagate the nonsensical thing the bandits are doing. When you write ‘Bandits kidnap so-so schoolchildren’ they enjoy the publicity and give them some faulty psychological victory. I’m not saying what the media is doing is bad; all I’m saying is that everyone is responsible. The media should not just report they also have to do a lot of analytical engagements to support the efforts to decimate the people causing all these problems.

Can the solution to end banditry ever be granting amnesty to bandits as being canvassed by some people?

People who don’t have any political social or economic agenda but whose only mission is to kill and kidnap for ransom can’t be given amnesty. How do you bring reprieve to the families of their victims? How do you comfort those whose life savings were wiped off and the families of those killed by the bandits? Many of the families of those who have lost their lives won’t recover from the trauma they are passing through for a very long time. What kind of amnesty do you want to give the criminals? Of course when you give amnesty you want to be sure that the criminals have been totally reformed. And then you would have monitored the individual over a period of time before giving them amnesty. To grant bandits amnesty overnight is a no-no. Some states governments did it in the past. Are they still not witnessing attacks?

Is there any similarity between the government rehabilitating Boko Haram fighters and granting amnesty to bandits?

There is a difference between rehabilitating prisoners of war and granting amnesty to people who you don’t have in custody to be able to reform. Most of the rehabilitated Boko Haram members voluntarily submitted themselves while some others who were arrested confessed that they were taken against their will. The government took a good time to take these people through an extensive rehabilitation programme and when it was convinced that the people had been reformed to a large extent it sent them back to their various communities. So rehabilitating ex-Boko Haram fighters who were prisoners of war and granting amnesty to bandits are two different things. Yes some of the rehabilitated ex-Boko Haram fighters may have gone back to the sect but at the same when you look at the Geneva Convention on how to deal with prisoners of war the government’s job is to deal with them humanely and when you are convinced they have changed you will give them their freedom and allow them to continue with their normal life.

Lately the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Isa Pantami has been under fire for making some comments in the past supporting terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Do you think such comments should be disregarded by the government?

Well if you’d excuse me. I don’t want to make any comment on this.

There are lots of expectations from the new security chiefs to contain widespread insecurity across the country. What advice would you give them to excel in their jobs?

The question is like saying these people don’t know what they are doing. These are people who know their onions. As soon as they were appointed they set out on their missions they have their goals and they are already on them. So we would have to give them time to see how they redefine their missions. For me they started on a good note and we need to support them.

A former presidential adviser Doyin Okupe about a week ago said it was time for Nigeria to have a national summit on security. Do you agree with his view?

That is his own view and everybody has the right to express their views. If the government feels his view should be taken and it takes it by organising a national summit on security it’s all well and good. There is nothing wrong with organising a national security summit if it is geared towards what every stakeholder in Nigeria is discussing.

Many people are blaming injustice by the government for the several secessionist agitations the country is witnessing. What’s your thought?

Agitations don’t just happen and when people say it’s the government’s fault who are the government? Are they not the same people who voted in those in power? When people say it’s the government’s fault we are looking at it as if the government is foreign. If the people are agitating it means they want certain policies to either be reviewed or changed? However when agitations become violent it’s a different issue entirely.

We’ve seen quite a number of jailbreaks in recent times the latest being that of the correctional facility in Owerri with over 1700 escapees still at large. What are the consequences for us?

It doesn’t spell good for the government and everyone. When gunmen attack correctional facilities and release inmates it means they have ulterior motives. It is likely that a group of people are assembling armed men to carry out illegal actions and the easiest way to carry out their mission is to free criminals who they know very well. It doesn’t spell well. And of course it constitutes a major security risk. When you jail people for murder armed robbery and other felonious offences and now they are out on the streets it constitutes a real danger to the average citizen. On the grounds of recidivism the tendency to commit other crimes will always be there.

The South-West and South-East now have regional security outfits namely Amotekun and Ebube Agu respectively no thanks to incessant attacks on their people by Fulani militia herdsmen. What’s your position on these outfits’ establishment?

All that this is pointing at is that the central policing system has become outdated. The central policing system can no longer deal with the splinter crime situations that we are having in Nigeria. Let’s look at Lagos State for instance. If the state didn’t have LASTMA (Lagos State Traffic Management Authority) how do you think that the Nigeria Police would have been able to cope with the volume of traffic that is in Lagos? Yes the police have the traffic management arm but how many of them do you see? This is what informed the South-West and South-East to start forming auxiliary security outfits to deal with issues that are becoming more difficult for the central police to deal with. The Amotekun and Ebube Agu are to complement the police’s efforts. Take a local government with just 40 police officers and a DPO (Divisional Police Officer) how are they going to cover every space in that local government? These are the realities on the ground and when you look at it it’s virtually the states that are supporting the central policing system. States provide the central police with vehicles and rehabilitate the police stations. States take up a lot of the operational funding of the police. So if the states could do all these for the central policing system which still has its own budget why wouldn’t they do it with their own security outfits? If the states want their own police all they need to do is to speak with one voice and tell their representatives at the National Assembly to move a motion to amend the provision in the constitution that gives only the Nigeria Police the power to man the whole country.

Should these regional outfits be allowed to bear sophisticated arms considering that their ‘enemies’ bear sophisticated weapons like AK-47?

Well if the outfits are able to get proper legal backing that allows them to carry proper weapons why not? But as it is they were formed to complement the police and that’s why wherever Amotekun goes in the South-West they have police teams that work with them. So far I think it’s been working quite well.

Police personnel and facilities have been frequently attacked in the South-East making some people ask that a state of emergency be declared in some of the states. Do you think it has got to that level?

No I don’t think it has got to the level of declaring a state of emergency. After all during the #EndSARS protests hoodlums attacked several police stations and carted away their weapons. Yet a state of emergency was not declared. What usually happens is that when there are attacks on police facilities like it is happening in the South-East there is a problem in the offing and it should be nipped in the bud. I think the governors in the region took positive steps by condemning the attacks on the police establishments and military personnel. That is the way it should be. Once the political authority affirms it is not tolerating criminality it will encourage everyone to know that what the attackers are doing is wrong.

The companies are offering the Ares version of the Ajax tracked reconnaissance vehicle already purchased by the Army fitted with a Brimstone missile capability carried in a modular cannister to meet a requirement to strengthen its anti-armor capability.

The teaming effort and the building of a capability demonstrator were announced by the companies July 26.

The Army already has a nascent program known as Battlegroup Organic Anti-Armour (BGOAA) in the pre-concept phase which includes the armed overwatch requirement.

Armed overwatch is a priority for the British and likely to be one of the first elements of the wider BGOAA program the military will look to move forward with as the procurement effort ramps up.

Ares is a troop carrying reconnaissance vehicle acquired by the British in a wider 2014 deal with General Dynamics worth £3.5 billion to provide 589 vehicles in the Ajax family.

The principal variant is a scout vehicle armed with a 40 mm case telescoped cannon.

Some 34 Ares vehicles were purchased as part of the deal and deliveries of the variant got underway last year.

In a statement Carew Wilks vice president and general manager of General Dynamics Land Systems–UK said the vehicle makers “collaboration with MBDA further demonstrates the versatility of the Ajax fleet through the delivery of an ‘Overwatch’ capability quickly and effectively for the heavy and deep recce strike brigade combat teams.”

Brimstone has been widely used by the Royal Air Force in Iraq Syria Afghanistan and Libya as an air to ground weapon. The missile has also been exported.

The latest version of the missile will be a key weapon deployed on the new General Atomic Protector drone purchased by the British to replace the Reaper vehicle.

As far as is known Brimstone has not been purchased to date as a surface-to-surface weapon but the weapon has been extensively test fired from land in support of maritime development campaigns.

The British are looking to step up their missile equipped armored vehicle capabilities.

Aside from the emerging BGOAA requirement the British are also looking to boost land anti-armour capabilities with a possible purchase of missile equipped Boxer wheeled armored personnel carriers.

The Army is looking at adding more fire power to it’s new Boxer force following the recent decision to axe the Warrior infantry fighting vehicle program.

One option might be to increase the number of Boxer reconnaissance variants fitted with anti-tank guided missiles.

For the moment the number of missile equipped reconnaissance vehicles purchased by the British stands at 50 but the Army is conducting an analysis to determine if more Boxer’s should be fitted with ATGMs.

Dominguez 32 of Apple Valley said she's thinking of getting a membership at the newly opened car wash which ups the number of local Quick Quacks to two but she settled for the ""Lucky Duck"" special on her first visit.

“It’s nearby easy in and easy out and very convenient since the car wash is on my way to and from work” said Dominguez who works as a dental assistant in Rancho Cucamonga.

The unveiling of the Hesperia location follows the February opening of the High Desert's first Quick Quack in Victorville on Park Avenue next to the Kaiser building the Daily Press reported.

The Victorville car wash was built on the site where Coco’s Bakery and Restaurant once stood before its demolition in 2019.

The grand opening of Quick Quack's Hesperia location on Tuesday followed the company’s pre-opening fundraiser on Monday for Richard Hall 76 a former Mojave Water Agency board member.

“Richard is on the road to recovery after he had triple bypass surgery last year that resulted in a major stroke and minor strokes” said Hall’s wife Natalie. “With exercise and treatment he should fully recover.”

Both Richard and Natalie Hall told the Daily Press they’re thankful for the support of Quick Quack and the community for the fundraiser where the donation-only car wash matched funds up to a predetermined amount.

As MWA's Division 3 director Hall represented Oak Hills Summit Valley area portions of Hesperia Pinon Hills Phelan and Baldy Mesa according to MWA spokeswoman Yvonne Cox.

“Richard Hall faithfully served Division 3 for 20 years” Cox said. “He was elected and began serving in December 2000 a position he continued to hold until December 2020.”

During his time with MWA Hall was also appointed to the California Special Districts Association Professional Development Committee.

Richard Hall said he also served on the Hesperia Recreation and Park District board of directors for nearly 20 years after he was first elected in 1982.

“I also made a run for 1st District supervisor back in the early 80s” said Richard Hall who served with the Army Medical Corps.

Hall’s career also included a 20-year stint with General Dynamics where he worked in product development research and testing.

Quick Quick officials said the company’s opening celebration runs Wednesday through May 2 with will free car washes and giveaways.

On Wednesday five customers will win one year of free car washes and the first 100 cars will receive a prize bag.

The Hesperia Quick Quack is located across from Victor Valley College on the corner of Bear Valley and Fish Hatchery roads in Hesperia. For more information visit www.FaceBook.com/QuickQuackHesperia.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: The General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark was a low-altitude strike plane born out of a shotgun wedding between competing Air Force and Navy requirements—with Defense Secretary McNamara as the minister. Despite its troubled adolescence it grew into a capable high-tech night bomber that lasted decades in service noted for its sleekly elegant profile.

Troubled Conception

In the early 1960s the Air Force came to realize that new radar-guided surface-to-air missiles such as the Soviet SA-2 could reach its slow high-altitude bombers. In response it devised a new concept: a smaller long-range supersonic bomber that could skim close to the ground below radar systems. At the same time the U.S. Navy was looking for a fast long-range carrier-based interceptor armed with air-to-air missiles that could take out Soviet bombers from a distance.

Newly appointed Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was convinced that a single aircraft could satisfy both requirements thereby saving on development costs. The Army and Navy were less keen on compromising their visions but were forced to cooperate on the so-called TFX program. A contract was awarded to General Dynamics in 1962. Because the design was smaller than Air Force strategic bombers and the service eschewed the “attack” designation used by the Navy it was designated with an “F” for fighter.

Revolutionary Design

The F-111 was built around two powerful yet fuel-efficient TF30 turbofan engines with new afterburner technology. A capacious fuselage could accommodate bomb loads of up to 31000 pounds and fuel for missions up 2500 miles long with external tanks adding another 1000 miles. The large plane weighed twenty tons empty—or more than twice that loaded.

The designers of the F-111 faced a challenge: they needed a plane that could fly at very high speeds but still take off or land on a short runway. Using smaller wings would create less drag allowing the aircraft to fly faster—but also create less lift requiring the aircraft achieve higher speeds before it take off in turn necessitating a longer runway. For example the other supersonic fighter-bomber of the era the F-105 Thunderchief had very small wings—and required airstrips over a mile long for takeoff limiting which airfields it could operate from.

The F-111’s designers adopted the new technology of variable-geometry or “swing” wings. These permitted the wings to swing out during takeoff to generate maximum lift and then would tuck inward midflight to achieve higher speeds. The F-111 was the first of several major designs that used the technology.

The two-man crew sat side by side in a cockpit pod. If they needed to escape a rocket boosted the pod upward which then floated to the ground on a parachute just like a space capsule.

A key innovation was the F-111’s revolutionary new terrain-following radar which mapped the ground directly in front of the plane and then automatically adjusted the flight path to avoid a collision. This allowed F-111s to fly as low as two hundred feet above the surface and make precise adjustments at high speed without crashing—even when flying at night or in bad weather conditions. The F-111’s talent for hunting in darkness nose close to the ground was what earned it the appellation “Aardvark.”

Early F-111s did show promise capable of flying over the speed of sound at Mach 1.2 at low-altitude or more than double that (Mach 2.5) at high altitude—all the while requiring only a 2000-foot runway to land. It was the first tactical aircraft to cross from the United States to Europe without mid-air refueling.

However the F-111’s design was biased in favor of the Air Force’s specifications. The carrier-based interceptor version the F-111B performed abominably in trials struggling to exceed Mach 1. The expensive forced compromise that was the naval version was finally scrapped leaving everyone millions of dollars poorer. Many of the more promising design elements of the F-111B made it over to the F-14 Tomcat however.

Deployment in Asia

The Air Force F-111s didn’t have an auspicious debut in combat. After a detachment of six F-111As was deployed to Vietnam in 1968 three of them crashed in just fifty-five missions all of the accidents linked to defective wing stabilizers. The Air Force was forced to withdraw the F-111 and correct the flaw at a cost of $100 million.

It wasn’t until the Linebacker raids in 1972 that the F-Aardvark finally demonstrated its potential. Skimming beneath North Vietnam’s extensive radar network at night F-111s blasted North Vietnamese airfields and air defense batteries weakening the resistance to incoming B-52 raids. Aardvarks didn’t require the fighter escort electronic warfare support or midair refueling that other bombers required and could operate in inclement weather. Only six F-111s were lost in combat over the course of 4000 missions during the war one of the lowest loss rates of the war.

F-111s ended up participating in the last combat operation undertaken by the U.S. military in South East Asia when the Cambodian Khmer Rouge seized the container ship S.S. Mayaguez in May 1975. Two Aardvarks diverted from a training flight were the first to locate the Mayaguez. Later an F-111 sank a Khmer Rouge patrol boat escorting the seized ship.

Variants

563 F-111s of all variants were built. After the F-111A the F-111D and E models upgraded the Aardvark’s electronics and engine inlets and increased the thrust of the engines. Another variant the FB-111 was designed as a strategic bomber with improved engines stretched two feet longer to accommodate additional fuel. Seventy-five of these served in Strategic Air Command units.

The F-111C was sold exclusively to Australia. It incorporated a mixture of design elements of the FB-111 and F-111E.

The definitive F-111F sported engines with thirty-five percent more thrust upgraded radar and a Pave Tack infrared targeting pod that allowed the crew to identify targets on the ground and hit them with precision-guided munitions.

Starting in the mid–1970s forty-two F-111As were converted into unarmed EF-111A Raven electronic jamming platforms at a cost $1.5 billion. The EF-111’s key system was an ALQ-99E jamming pod that emitted radiation that scrambled radars in the vicinity permitting entire formations of aircraft to pass in its wake undetected. When active the jammer’s current literally caused the hairs on the crew’s heads to stand as it crackled through the plane. Thus the Raven was known as the “Spark Vark” to its pilots. The EF-111 is distinguishable by the receiver pod on the tail fin.

El Dorado Canyon Raid

The F-111 would return to the stage of world history in 1986 after the bombing of the La Belle nightclub perpetrated by Libyan agents in Berlin killed two U.S. servicemen. Reagan ordered an attack on Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi’s personal compound near Tripoli codenamed Operation El Dorado Canyon. It was an early attempt to assassinate a head of state by air attack.

An array of twenty-five SAM sites defended Tripoli. A squadron of eighteen F-111Fs carried out the main attack joined by four EF-111 Ravens to electronically scramble the defense radars. A separate Navy strike hit targets near Benghazi.

Because the United States couldn’t get approval from mainland European countries for the raid the Aardvarks took off from the UK and had to circumnavigate Spain increasing total flight time to thirteen hours. In all they would need to be refueled six times on the roundtrip. It was the longest fighter mission in history.

As a feat of logistics the raid was impressive—but unfortunately both F-111’s performance and the conception of the operation as a whole left something to be desired. One F-111 was shot down probably by a SAM and its crew was lost. Four were unable to release weapons because of avionics failures and one F-111 had to land in Spain because of an overheating engine. Seven missed their target with several of the bombs landing in civilian areas nearly hitting the French embassy.

Qaddafi managed to escape thanks in part due to a last-minute warning from the prime minister of Italy. Eight of his children and his wife were wounded and his infant adopted daughter Hanna reportedly killed. (There is some controversy as to Hanna’s identity and whether she survived). Though Qaddafi was shaken he went on to instigate further terrorist attacks notably the hijacking of Pan Am 73 and the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie Scotland.

Aardvarks and Ravens Over Iraq

On January 17 1991 the opening night of Operation Desert Storm Aardvarks zipped across the desert at a low altitude targeting Iraqi air defenses and key military installations with laser-guided bombs. Meanwhile EF-111 Ravens accompanied strike packages of coalition aircraft flying deep into Iraq their jammers disabling Iraqi air-defense radars. In all sixty-six F-111Fs and 18 F-111Es were deployed in the 1991 Iraq War flying 5000 missions.

From helicopters to tanks and airplanes everything is on the table as the U.S. is aiming for military superiority in the years to come.

Take the M2 Bradley  the infantry fighting vehicle that has been in service since 1981. Although it proved itself time and time again on the world’s battlefields it’s getting old enough that no amount of upgrades can keep it relevant indefinitely.That is why the U.S. Army launched in 2017 the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program. It covers a number of new machines and in the case of the Bradley a replacement called Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV).There are two prototypes presently being tested for the OMFV the Rheinmetall-made Lynx KF41 and General Dynamics’ Griffin III. In the case of the former development just got a boost in mid-April.It was then when Rheinmetall announced it selected L3Harris to develop the vehicle’s mission cybersecurity and its modular open systems approach.“We are excited to have L3Harris join our growing team to support the U.S. Army’s OMFV program” said in a statement Mathew Warnick Managing Director for American Rheinmetall Vehicles.“Their experience in open architecture communications and cybersecurity bring tremendous capability to the American Rheinmetall Vehicles team as we prepare our digitally engineered OMFV to provide our Soldiers overmatch now and for the future.”The Lynx is a tracked armored vehicle equipped with autocannons light machine guns and grenade launchers. Its engine is capable of developing 750 hp and gives the thing a top speed of 70 kph (43 mph).But that’s just one configuration and because it is modular it can be transformed in anything from ambulance to infantry fighting vehicle. Rheinmetall plans two versions of it one weighing up to 38 tons and capable of seating up to six soldiers and a slightly larger one that can carry eight."

Inflation is coming. Look no further than Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble sharing plans this week to raise prices to offset rising commodity costs. The costs of raw materials ranging from lumber to resin are surging so companies are taking steps to protect profits. The price increases follow a year of surging demand for a host of items from paper towels to jars of peanut butter. Sales of consumer packaged goods rose 9.4% to $1.53 trillion last year according to the Consumer Brands Association. Many manufacturers pulled back on advertising and promotions as they tried to keep up with demand gaining market share without much marketing. ING Chief International Economist James Knightley is forecasting consumer prices will continue to rise in the near term and could gain almost 4% by May compared with the same time a year ago. The consumer price index which tracks how much U.S. consumers pay for a basket of goods rose 2.6% in March from the year-ago period according to the Department of Labor.

Inventories are 'too low'

Low inventory is helping companies flex their pricing power he said. ""According to the Institute for Supply Management their latest survey showed a net 40% of manufacturers are reporting that their customer inventories are 'too low'"" Knightley said. ""This offers more evidence that corporate pricing power is strengthening.""

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards

Food industry analyst Phil Lempert said numerous factors have increased costs for farmers that pick produce factories that make consumer packaged goods and meatpacking plants that process beef pork and chicken. Ports are congested truck drivers are in short supply and food workers must try to socially distance. That's made it harder to keep up with demand and get items from grains to Italian cheeses shipped across the globe.

Price hikes get stealthy

Moody's analyst Linda Montag said that she doesn't view higher prices as a competitive advantage because all consumer companies are facing higher commodity costs. Besides Coke and P&G PepsiCo  Kimberly-Clark  General Mills and J.M. Smucker have addressed raising prices. And consumers might not even notice that they're paying more for diapers or soda. ""Consumer companies across the board have gotten very savvy about how to implement price increases without just slapping on five to 10% price increases"" Montag said in an interview. Some of those methods include using new packaging selling smaller-size packs for the same price or offering promotions that bring the price down until consumers are used to the higher sticker price. Hedging positions may also give some manufacturers like Coke and Pepsi more flexibility to raise their prices gradually because they won't feel the impact of higher commodity costs for several quarters.

More cash in consumer pockets means less risk

Hiking prices always carries a risk that demand for those products will fall. However Moody's analyst Chedly Louis said that she isn't expecting consumers to trade down to private label products because consumers put their trust in bigger brands during the crisis. That behavior is expected to stick around longer. ""There's a potential for the consumer to trade down within P&G's product portfolio to cheaper lower margin products. It's still P&G but it's cheaper"" Louis said. Many consumers also have more cash in their wallets from government stimulus checks and foregoing travel sports games and fine dining for year. Not all companies have the same flexibility to raise prices. Piper Sandler downgraded Kraft Heinz stock on Friday citing the company's relatively weak pricing power as one reason for the decision. Analyst Michael Lavery wrote that the company's pricing power lags behind that of peers like General Mills  Mondelez and Hershey  so hiking prices could hurt demand.

Discounts are rare

Most retailers will pass on the higher prices to consumers. Lempert said that grocers are juggling pricier services like online grocery delivery or curbside pickup leaving little room in profit margins to absorb higher food costs. The cost of groceries had already been rising as retailers offered fewer discounts while shoppers cleared shelves last spring and bought more cooking supplies than usual in the months that followed. Phil Tedesco vice president of retail intelligent analytics for NielsenIQ said in a typical month 31.5% of units are sold on promotion. In March only 28.6% of units were sold on promotion. ""This has led to shoppers having fewer opportunities to take advantage of sales in the store and as a result the total cost of grocery products has increased slightly"" he said. J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman wrote in a note to clients on Monday that higher prices will help food retailers particularly as they face tough comparisons to last year's skyrocketing demand. ""Too much inflation is bad for grocers but an incremental 2-3% (roughly the percentage the producers need to pass through) with a mix shift toward higher-priced products is probably very helpful right now"" he said. —CNBC's Melissa Repko contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW9ubGluZW5nLmNvbS93ZS1hcmUtbm90LWF0LXdhci13aXRoLWFueS1jb21wYW55LWZsb3VyLW1pbGxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We are not at war with any company – Flour Mills,"The management of Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) Plc has again refuted rumour making the rounds that its subsidiary Golden Penny Sugar is at daggers drawn with some operators in the market segment on the issue of pricing.

Dispelling the rumour in a chat with the media in Lagos after hosting the Management Team of the NSDC led by its new Executive Secretary Mr Zacch Adedeji; the Deputy Chief Operating Officer Agro-Allied Division/Director Backward Integration Program (FMN) Mr. Sadiq Usman added that the only ‘war’ the company was presently fighting remains how to achieve its commitments to the government and its shareholders.

According to him while the company had earlier released some statements to that effect it had become imperative to reiterate the company’s position that its product pricing would only be determined by its raw material costs and not because of any bitter price war.

“We had put out a statement to the general public and we specifically put out a statement to the stock exchange. We are not engaged in a bitter war with any company at FMN. The only war we are presently engaged in is with ourselves which is to achieve our commitments to both the government and our shareholders” he added.

Sodiq also argued that as a publicly-listed company that had been around since 1978 the company would never be involved in any ‘business of collusion’ aimed at shortchanging its teeming customers.

“We are much older than most of the other companies in this sector we are not in the business of collusion. We are committed to providing our customers with quality products and if we have to vary prices it will be determined by the factor of our raw material costs and these are transparent issues since they are internationally-traded” he added.

Expressing his delight at the state-of-the-art facility at the sugar refinery company the Executive Secretary of the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC) Mr. Zacch Adedeji assured of the federal government’s commitment to fully implement the Sugar Masterplan.

According to him when fully implemented the policy would go a long way in solving the knotty issue of unemployment in the country.

“The sugar industry presents to us the opportunity of a direct labour of 110000 when we are in full gear of meeting 1.7million tonnes per annum of local demand. That is why the FG is fully committed to implementing Nigeria Sugar Masterplan.

“We’ll do it not because we just have to do it but because that is one of those things we have to do to solve the problem of unemployment in the country.

Today unemployment is very high and the only way to solve this is to give the sugar industry the much-needed attention.

“We are therefore here to implement the masterplan so as to create jobs and ensure that investors get returns on their investments and there is prosperity for us all” the NSDC’s boss stated.

Other noticeable names among investors are SK Inc. Temasek Applied Ventures LLC Shanghai Auto and Vertex.

SES for multiple years now has been working on the next generation lithium-metal anode (Li-Metal) batteries for electric vehicles. GM is one of the strategic automotive partners.

The two intend to build a pilot manufacturing facility for prototype cells in Woburn Massachusetts and start pre-production by 2023.

""Following strategic additions to its global leadership team and the announcement of a joint development agreement with GM SES is uniquely positioned to commercialize Li-Metal cells. As a result of the recent joint development agreement with GM SES and GM will build a manufacturing prototyping line in Woburn Massachusetts for a high-capacity pre-production battery by 2023.""

The company says that its cells have multiple advantages including:

High energy density: >400 Wh/kg and >1000 Wh/L

Fast charging: to 80% of battery capacity in just 15 minutes

Safety: ""Our electrolyte greatly enhances battery safety""

Optimization: ""Optimized by AI: Our AI-powered algorithm is trained on terabytes of data optimizing battery performance safety and charging across a wide variety of applications.""

Cost-efficient and scalable: ""can be produced at high volume using existing Li-ion infrastructure""

One of the images on SES' website shows the ""Apollo"" long automotive cell envisioned for 2022 (the other two are for drone applications):

Who knows maybe at some point in the future General Motors will use those new cells to double the range of electric cars. Currently GM invests in the manufacturing capacity of more conventional solutions with LG Chem's LG Energy Solution.

Qichao Hu founder and CEO of SES said:

""This new round of funding will help accelerate technology development significantly expand our technical business and manufacturing teams and expedite the commercialization of Li-Metal batteries"".

Matt Tsien GM executive vice president and chief technology officer and president GM Ventures said:

""GM has been rapidly driving down battery cell costs and improving energy density and our work with SES technology has incredible potential to deliver even better EV performance for customers who want more range at a lower cost. This investment by GM and others will allow SES to accelerate their work and scale up their business.""

Yangtaek Kim executive vice president of SK Inc. said:

""SK Inc. is continuously looking to invest in key technology companies in battery materials which are becoming more important with the rapid growth of the EV market. We are pleased to be backing SES which is making great progress in the next-generation battery development and we believe it will bring meaningful change to the global EV industry.""

The event was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 lockdown but the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy brought it back this year partnering with the Detroit River Coalition a group of organizations throughout southeast Michigan that share a goal to preserve the Detroit River.

“Not only is it Earth Week but it’s also a time of year where people are ready to get back outside and it’s been a long winter on the cut” said Renee Rodriquez program manager for the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy. “ ... A lot of the litter accumulates down here because it’s below street level.”

Volunteer Christina Ilijanic of Plymouth brought her daughters Caroline 5 and Eve 4. They picked up trash in a section of the greenway along an grassy embankment.

“I think it’s important for them to give back early and to instill that in them relatively young” said Ilijanic a longtime volunteer with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy and a General Motors Co. employee.

“This is an activity that you can make fun for little kids. … It’s also important for them to understand the impact of the decisions we make. We picked up some things that we have eaten before. Like a Doritos bag. This is why we have to be careful about what we do with our trash and what we buy.”

The steep terrain turned into an adventure for the girls.

“I like going up the hill” Caroline said.

With some help from her daughters Ilijanic filled a large garbage bag.

“It’s our job to be the stewards particularly around the river and the water” she said. “There are so many reasons. It keeps it pretty the environment clean. It keeps the animals safe and it keeps the water clean too because the only other place that all this stuff is going is to the river. If you can keep a garbage bag of plastic out of the river even better.”

In recent years the cleanup has included several streets along the greenway. Volunteers include employees from DTE Energy and General Motors and others who frequent the greenway.

“They’re regular users they come down on weekends” Rodriquez said. “Because ... they want to give back. They want to see it kept clean.”

Alexis Holley 16 said she's visited the greenway before and chose the cleanup as a volunteer activity to fulfill some service hours for high school.

The Warren teen and her father Fernandez Holley picked up trash in a gravel and grass parking area near the Dequindre Cut entrance at Gratiot. They filled their bags with bottles cans paper and a lot of cigarettes she said.

""I think it's really good"" Holley said of the cleanup. ""That's another reason I came out. It would help the environment.""

But in the near future radar imaging could be used to monitor what's going on inside of your car.

It could detect a baby left in the backseat for example or alert a distracted driver. It could even measure a passenger's heart rate through their chest movement.

Carmakers are looking into radar technology since they'll need seat sensors and alerts in new U.S. vehicles by 2025 to prevent child fatalities. In 2019 there were 52 hot car deaths in the United States according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. More than half of them involved children left in a car most of them kids under 2 years old.

That's why the FCC waived restrictions to allow Tesla and other companies — including Brose IEE Sensing and more — to incorporate radar technology inside of vehicles.

Other carmakers such as General Motors Ford Volkswagen Toyota Hyundai Subaru Volvo Honda and others have all supported legislation to put seat reminders in cars. These trigger an audible warning to drivers if they open the rear door at the start of a trip but don't open it when it's over.

An imaging radar chip can replace a car's cameras infrared cameras weight sensors in the seat and touch sensors in the steering wheel.

Ian Podkamien head of automotive at Israel-based Vayyar an imaging chip company said its single-chip radar system can provide a view of the entire car including the trunk without the need to record any faces or identifying information.

Podkamien says it can differentiate between inanimate objects and passengers. So if a briefcase is left behind the system doesn't freak out car owners by indicating their kid might be in the backseat.

Vayyar also claims it can track the driver’s body and head position to make sure they’re not nodding off behind the wheel. And it keeps count of how many passengers enter and leave the car to make sure nobody is left behind. It’s so effective claims Podkamien that it can ""see"" through a blanket to notice a baby in its car seat.

Is it safe?

""We are talking about a device that is transmitting about 1000 times weaker signal than your WiFi in your smartphone"" which many keep next to the bed at night he said. All FCC waivers were for radar systems operating within the 60 GHz spectrum band a standard for WiFi used to connect say a tablet to a TV.

Jeff Jury however says that monitoring passengers without a camera can make it hard to accurately know what's going on in the car.

He is the general manager for connected cars at Xperi which recently released a camera-based cabin monitoring system. A system without cameras is ""weaker"" and more prone to false positives Jury claims. Xperi's cameras don't use any radar sensors.

Vayyar's Podkamien argues that only using radar can make the car experience safer for passengers and cheaper for carmakers. ""[It's] increasing safety while reducing cost"" while maintaining the same high resolution and wide field of view cameras offer he said. He too believes radar can ""help minimize false alarms.""

Jury counters that radar is ""inferring"" about scenarios based on movement or audio cues rather than knowing from immediate visual analysis. But the systems all have the same goal. ""We’re all about creating a safer environment in the car"" he said. Jury said that none of the information collected by the system is stored externally.

Credit: xperi/DTS AUTOSENSE

Like Vayyar South Korean startup bitsensing partnered with Infineon to release a radar chip that can detect people underneath blankets and monitor the breathing and heart rates of passengers.

Why is that useful? Before a crash the car could adjust the seat belt or air bag positioning based on the size of the passenger. After a crash it could share vital statistics with emergency responders.

Here's the chip in action:

Bitsensing and Vayyar’s chips can also sense about 6.5 feet around the car. That enables features like Tesla's Sentry mode  which detects activity around a parked car to warn away would-be intruders who get too close.

Swedish mobility firm Veoneer and emotional AI startup Affectiva want to incorporate radar sensing to check on passengers in autonomous vehicles and make sure the robocars don’t start driving before passengers are done climbing into the car or buckling their seat belt.

Radar might be used for ""immersive"" entertainment too Xperi's Jury said. Future cars might play calming music to bring a driver's heart rate down or something more upbeat if they're dozing off.

But in the near future drivers will have to settle for knowing they haven't left anyone in the back seat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvZ20tdHJhZGVtYXJrcy1jaGV5ZW5uZS1mb3ItdW5rbm93bi10cnVjay1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi0xNTk5NjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Trademarks “Cheyenne” for Unknown Truck Application,What did you get for your hard-earned cash? In the case of the C/K series the Cheyenne added chrome-finish bumpers a wood-grained tailgate insert full carpeting for the interior upper and lower side moldings and a lot of vinyl coverings. Full wheel covers trim-ringed Rally wheels dual-tone paint jobs or A/C were often specified with this package back then.Although discontinued more than two decades ago General Motors couldn’t abandon the handle just like that. Many trademarks later the biggest of the Big Three in Detroit has once again filed a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for Cheyenne on April 16th Under goods and services the nameplate is meant for “motor land vehicles namely trucks” according to the federal agency. The question is what kind of truck is General Motors referring to? The Silverado comes to mind and the Colorado would be a perfect fit as well.In both cases Chevrolet may use the Cheyenne as a trim level or package. As for the final possibility Cheyenne could be used for a brand-new pickup based on a sport utility vehicle. The 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz is the perfect case in point along with the mid-sized Honda Ridgeline and the all-new 2022 Ford Maverick with Escape bits and pieces.If the most unlikely scenario does come to fruition General Motors would have three SUVs to choose from starting with the compact-sized Equinox. The mid-sized Blazer and Traverse appear to be the more likely candidates especially in terms of payload capacity wheelbase and engine options.As a brief refresher the motor to have in the Blazer and Traverse is the 3.6-liter V6 we all know and love from the Chevrolet Camaro. The 2.5- and 2.0-liter fours aren’t up for the job especially when it comes to pulling a trailer. In case you were wondering the Blazer tows up to 4500 pounds (2041 kilograms) while the Traverse offers 5000 pounds (2268 kilograms).

John was describing how it felt to pivot the 29th annual affair from an in-person glamour-drenched fundraiser to a streaming event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It’s become an all too familiar sentiment over the past 13 months and one shared by many event producers but still John was quick to walk back the comment and clarify.

“It’s not a pain. I wish we could be there. It’s more fun to be there” he said in reference to typical plans that would’ve found him at center stage inside a custom structure built on West Hollywood Park grounds. “This is the only way we could do it.”

And how they did it was by partnering with sponsors Cisco Webex and Parx Casino along with Fulwell 73 to produce a 60-minute pre-show special that was co-hosted by John partner David Furnish and the couple’s close friend Neil Patrick Harris a one-time Oscar host. They drafted global pop superstar Dua Lipa to perform a set from her smash Future Nostalgia album and lined up a slew of special guests including Lady Gaga (who talked mental health) Cynthia Erivo Dr. Anthony Fauci comedian David Walliams Elizabeth Hurley and the cast of It’s a Sin including Olly Alexander Nathaniel Curtis Omari Douglas Callum Scott Howells and Lydia West.

…with appearances by Cynthia Erivo (in glittery flamingo dress that rivals Bjork's swan dress) and Lady Gaga who talked importance of mental health in battle against HIV/AIDS.

The bulk of the production was filmed at Rosewood London and for the first time in the event’s history the general public could check out the action by purchasing tickets via Ticketmaster with four options for various time zones including North America Europe Australia and New Zealand. Gilead Sciences Robert Kraft Judy and Leonard Lauder served as co-sponsors with Bob and Tamar Manoukian Brett A. Pletcher and Aruna Ravichandran serving as event chairs. Charles de Cazanove provided the bubbly as champagne partner.

“Obviously things are a little different this year” Harris said in his opening bit. “But it won’t stop us from having an awesome time together.”

That awesome time saw Harris giving it his all by introducing various presenters and pieces of content trumpeting the cause of raising money for EJAF and interviewing John and Furnish. “Did you ever imagine that you would be virtual hosts?” Harris asked the pair a question fielded by Furnish. “It’s amazing during the pandemic how with the miracle of modern technology we’ve been able to stay connected.”

The couple then shared their favorites heading into the big show. Furnish said he was a big fan of Promising Young Woman and its leading lady Carey Mulligan while John put Minari atop his list. “It was uplifting and a great story” he said adding that he loved Judas and the Black Messiah and One Night in Miami. “We’ve watched all of them” he said of this year’s crop. “Heavy going and some brilliantly-made films.”

Harris then allowed John to have the honors of introducing Dua Lipa and he did so by praising her as “the biggest artist in the world right now.” Looking ready for the Oscars in a glamorous black gown and white diamonds the Grammy winner performed “Levitating” “Pretty Please” “Hallucinate” and “Don’t Start Now.” She changed ensembles (adding Chopard earrings) to join John later in the show for a his and hers duet: his classic “Bennie and the Jets” and hers with “Love Again.” When it was over Dua Lipa said it was a “dream and an honor” to perform opposite John.

Shortly thereafter the Oscar telecast began and the event pivoted again to become an official watch party. During the commercial breaks Will & Grace favorite Eric McCormack (a longtime friend of John and Furnish and a regular Oscar party attendee) relieved Harris to fill in as co-host. John and Furnish also filled the airtime by offering their reactions to the show including the winners and the setting — not all of it positive.

“The Oscar ceremony looks like it’s coming from a Starbucks somewhere” John said during the first commercial break of the Union Station location. Later he added “I still can’t get over the set though.” He seemed much more pleased with the winners calling best supporting acting winner Daniel Kaluuya “a lovely man.” “He was brilliant in Get Out.”

Audio glitches proved to be the only mishap of the virtual production with McCormack’s feed going out at times. “It’s our first virtual Oscars” John said. “We were bound to get a glitch somewhere.” They eventually sorted it out and McCormack continued broadcasting from the backyard of his home where he welcomed country singer MacKenzie Porter and her husband who performed a country hit. Later McCormack had the honor of breaking the news about the fundraising tally. “We reached our goal of $3 million which is pretty incredible” he said ending the virtual show.

Morgan Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are three of the banks who have taken the lead on using APIs for global banking

With companies expanding into new regions and doing more trade with the rest of the world than ever before global transaction banking has become critical to their success.

Traditionally major banks have provided these essential services covering everything from transfers payments and cash and asset management to financing and global trade.

It’s a money spinner that generates almost $1 trillion in global annual revenues and is expected to grow to $7.2 trillion in ten years according to industry estimates.

Previously banks had relied on legacy systems and technologies such as host-to-host file transfer to integrate their services with clients’ systems. However while working well for single-step transactions they struggle with more complicated real-time functionalities such as reconciliation trade services collections and supply chain finance.

In the face of increasing competition from more nimble rivals notably fintechs and digital banks banking institutions have had to up their game. Enter business-to-business (B2B) application programming interfaces (APIs) which enable banks to simplify transactions and provide clients with a seamless service.

Why use APIs in global banking?

But what are the key challenges involved in migrating to this new technology and how can banks overcome them? What has been the effect of regulation? And how can they capitalise on the biggest growth areas?

APIs work in closed networks that integrate banks’ services with their clients’ enterprise systems and workflows. They allow banks to scale complex operations and eliminate the need for brokers or service bureaus.

Banks including Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan and the Bank of America have already taken the lead. Yet as a technology it’s still in its relative infancy with a lack of clearly defined industry standards and is restricted by clunky infrastructure and governance protocols.

What are the drawbacks of APIs?

The biggest challenge is in developing a platform that is both user friendly and compatible with clients’ systems. Too many APIs however are let down by poor or overcomplicated designs due to lack of development expertise.

“API banking is a product with unique design constraints and challenges in the same way mobile or web banking are” says David Jarvis co-founder and chief executive of Griffin a banking-as-a-service provider. “You need to build out that expertise internally and none of the banks have invested in this to date.”

They also need to be fully secure well documented and meet ever-evolving regulatory changes. Then there is the considerable cost involved too as well as overhaul of existing systems and processes.

To overcome these issues banks must embrace technology and change with a dedicated team focused on developing a strategy and rigorously testing their APIs. They should also collaborate with clients and partners including fintechs thus spreading the cost of innovation and reducing time to market.

How to implement APIs properly

As an absolute basic first step banks need to invest in a digital banking platform that links their gateway and product processors and functions to enable their APIs. That platform informs all the modification authentication authorisation and consent-management capabilities as well as connecting multiple information sources.

Société Générale has achieved this by building its B2B SG Markets platform. It provides everything from cash management financing and security services to global markets and private banking.

“By implementing machine learning and combining our cash management and FX [foreign exchange] within our platform we have created a one-stop shop” says Société Générale’s head of execution platforms and UK chief digital officer Sohail Raja. “It enables clients to do everything from managing their transactions to taking cash positions on different currencies.”

Citi meanwhile has partnered with treasury software providers including FIS Kyriba Oracle and SAP to embed its API functionalities into their core products. This month its CitiConnect platform reached one billion calls from corporate clients since its launch in 2017 while API volume grew 60 per cent in 2020.

“APIs are great for real-time treasury services to enable our clients to have the most optimal digital banking experience” says Mayank Mishra managing director and global head of digital channels at Citi treasury and trade solutions. “Open banking is an extension of this but one that helps enable an entire market or industry vertical.”

UniCredit has also teamed up with FinDynamic to build its platform which allows clients to automatically view invoices through a web-based or mobile platform and approve invoices for payment. In September 2020 it launched the first open banking API with an IBAN check to enable clients to verify their customers’ account details.

Open banking innovation

The move to APIs is being fuelled by open banking regulations such as the European Union’s Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the introduction of the United Payments Interface in India. PSD2 has required banks to release their data in a secure standardised form so it can be readily shared between authorised parties online.

“Industry needs like smart personalisation and corporate banking are driving the conversation beyond banking directives now” says Vikram Gupta global vice president at Oracle Financial Services. “These capabilities need access to premium information beyond regulatory mandates that give banks an opportunity to tap into new revenue streams and provide better services to their customers as well maintain customer stickiness.”

How new tech is supporting global transaction banking

Simultaneously artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have vastly improved risk and liquidity analytics and forecasting within treasury management systems. Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have also driven the digitalisation of trade and supply chain finance.

“Banks need to accept that the future of finance is decentralised and integrate blockchain and AI into their overall digital transformation strategy” says Inpay’s head of financial institutions Stan Cole. “They can remain a central part of society by capitalising on the tremendous opportunities technology brings in terms of an incomparably higher speed and lower cost.”

The biggest growth areas over the next three years will be cash management and trade finance. More than 85 per cent of respondents to a McKinsey survey plan to invest in cash management APIs in the next three years and almost 50 per cent want to expand their trade finance APIs.

Banks can support this by upgrading their API capabilities to allow clients to initiate self-service transactions directly. They can also cater to clients in different time zones with real-time payment processing liquidity risk and fraud management cash-flow forecasting reporting and pricing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXR1cm4taHVtYmxlLXFyLWNvZGUtMDQzMDQwODI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Return of the Humble QR Code,"As digital investments skyrocketed amid the pandemic and technologies filled the market looking to meet new needs not all technology was new. In fact the QR code which was originally introduced in the 1990s saw rapid adoption by businesses looking to offer safe contactless experiences to consumers.

According to data from SimilarWeb the last 12 months have seen a sharp increase in the volume of people visiting a number of the market-leading QR code generator websites over the last 12 months.

More from WWD

Designed as an evolution of the bar code in Japan the QR Code offers companies the ability to easily share large amounts of information and even enable contactless payments. Though compared to the time of the QR Code’s original introduction today nearly every consumer carries smartphones making QR Code technology that much more accessible.

And as stores restaurants fitness studios and other businesses started to reopen last year QR Codes have become popular in various uses of maintaining proper social distancing including providing links to digital menus health or consent forms and payments.

“The reason why QR Codes though also became popular was for the merchant because in some cases merchant terminals weren’t set up to take tapping or set up to achieve those direct mobile payments” said Zach Aron U.S. banking and capital markets payments leader and co-leader of the global payments practice at Deloitte Consulting. “QR codes are really easy in that they could be literally printed out and just taped down.”

At the same time data from SimilarWeb suggests consumers are happy to engage through QR Codes as well with younger consumers showing to be the most interested as 62 percent of visits from QR Codes from April 2020 to March 2021 came from consumers aged between 18 to 34.

Moreover using QR Codes allows digital transactions to begin earlier in the consumer journey. For example Aron said in the case of a hair salon stylists have been able to have individual QR codes printed out at the front of the store so that customers can check in for appointments and then pay a stylist directly after a service. Similarly fitness studios have prompted consumers to use a QR Code displayed at a front desk to fill out health-related surveys or consent forms upon visiting.

In fact Aron said the QR Code often begins the experience at the front door and when used right can elevate the consumer experience in its entirety. For example some businesses have set a QR Code as a means to communicate with the consumer in a contactless way. The code may bring the consumer to an app that allows options such as alerting sales personnel to bring out a BOPIS or curbside pick-up order or prompt a consumer to create a new order. By prompting the consumer to take a picture of the QR Code you have effectively initiated communication.

Story continues

Still one of the most popular reasons for merchants to integrate QR Codes this year has been to provide consumers with contactless payment options.

Notably PayPal began rolling out QR Code payments for touch-free in-person buying and selling technology in May 2020 as a health-conscious safe and secure option. The option is now available in 600000 retail locations across 28 global markets including CVS Foot Locker Nike Levi’s Bloomingdales and Macy’s.

In an official statement of the launch the company described the technology as having the ability to be quickly implemented without the need of any new hardware software or purchase. “From farmers markets dog walkers to restaurants QR Codes benefit by being a form factor that offers more than just payments” said Frank Keller senior vice president of consumer in-store and digital commerce at PayPal.

“We saw rapid adoption of PayPal and Venmo QR Codes over the last year with hundreds of thousands of small businesses and casual sellers offering the technology around the world as a safe and touch-free way to pay during the pandemic” Keller told WWD. “QR Codes also benefit by being a form factor that offers more than just payments. From information sharing such as menus Loyalty personalized customer recommendations creating moments of delight all the way through to payments QR Codes can offer both the consumer and the merchant a deeper and more personalized experience optimized for conversion.”

Merchants can generate PayPal QR codes within the PayPal app which can then be printed or ordered from the PayPal webstore to display for consumers to scan.

One great example of adoption Keller said is Longstone Farm a small business that adopted PayPal’s QR Codes to help successfully pivot from a cash-only business during the pandemic to offer consumers digital touch-free payment options at their small farm and produce shop in Virginia.

Further Keller said PayPal has seen merchants experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes from consumers who frequently use its QR Codes. For consumers the PayPal QR Code allows them the benefits of PayPal wallet in-store where shoppers can use a stored debit or credit cards bank accounts a PayPal balance or PayPal credit to pay.

Another adapter of the QR Code as a payment method is Facebook Pay who has “begun testing the ability for people to send or request money” on Messenger to make payments easier according to a spokesperson from Facebook.

Looking forward Aron said as businesses continue to return to in-person operations QR Codes have enabled both consumers and merchants with the added convenience that is not likely to be disregarded when social distancing eases and may even provide more ways to elevate the consumer experience in the future.

While the global debate on the long-term appeal (and impact) of cryptocurrencies and blockchain doesn't seem like it will reach a conclusive end any time soon Alex Alexandrov and Farkhad Shagulyamov are however quite clear on which side of the discussion they are on. ""Crypto and blockchain are here to stay"" Alexandrov declares. ""It is going to be embedded seamlessly into your digital and physical life and the sooner you take the time to learn more about it today the more you will benefit in the future.""

Now their position on this topic shouldn't come as much of a surprise- they are after all entrepreneurs who are essentially betting (and well capitalizing) on this realm. Besides the two being the co-founders of Velas (""an ecosystem of decentralized products that allow anyone to feel the benefits of blockchain technology"") Alexandrov is also the CEO of CoinPayments which has been billed as ""the largest altcoin payment processor and wallet solution in the world."" As such there shouldn't be any raised eyebrows when Alexandrov takes on an evangelical aura to explain why all of us -and yes he means everyone- need to be clued into these digital inventions that are already making their presence felt in the world around us. ""If you are an entrepreneur you must do it"" he says. ""If you are a business owner you must do it too. Sooner or later people won't be able to avoid it. Everything that connects us globally will be heavily reliant on the blockchain. There is already talk about biometric passports running on the blockchain specifically due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it's just another example of how the tech is being used other than through payment systems.""

Alexandrov is clearly someone who's keeping himself abreast of trends that are moving the world in a different direction than we are accustomed to and that's a characteristic that can be chalked down to the entrepreneurial mindset he seems to have been born with. ""I have always been an entrepreneur at heart ever since I was a child"" Alexandrov says. ""When I was five or six years old I would resell newspapers in Odessa Ukraine by waking up before everyone and buying newspapers from the market while others slept. I then sold them to the adults on the way to work before I took myself to school. However at the time being a Soviet era family my parents didn't appreciate what I did and told me to stop- I still don't know why!"" But that didn't (thankfully) end Alexandrov's entrepreneurial streak- on the contrary he leaned in harder to this aspect of his personality. Fast forward a few years into the 90s Alexandrov started making money off the sale and delivery of goods his peers wanted during that time- and that became the capital for another new venture.

Farkhad Shagulyamov and Alex Alexandrov co-founders Velas

""I took the money I had earned and I started organizing street parties"" Alexandrov recalls. ""These then became so popular that the police came to shut them down thinking that adults were up to no good. Once they realized it was the work of a 12-year-old they encouraged me to keep going which I did until I moved to Canada."" But even migrating to a new nation didn't dampen his entrepreneurial spirit- in his new location Alexandrov found himself able to assemble computers and then find buyers for them online. And while he did manage to make money off this operation Alexandrov found himself wanting to earn more and that led him to launching a business in an entirely new industry to do just that. ""I found I could trade my time for money and that got me interested in trading options and leverage futures and forex"" he remembers.

""After the 2012 market crash I came across bitcoin and quickly began mining it at US$4 per token."" If you're a bitcoin enthusiast this is the point where you'd probably sit up and look at Alexandrov in a different light- his last statement makes it clear that he's an early adopter when it comes to jumping on the cryptocurrency wave and that's also a testament to his eye for spotting opportunities that others may not be as receptive to.

""When I found bitcoin I was already reading a lot of economic and banking books so the concept of money was already quite clear to me (more so than your average person) and the concept of digitizing things was not foreign to me"" Alexandrov says. ""So when I saw bitcoin I immediately recognized it as the future and I never had any doubts about it. When I bought and mined my first bitcoin at $4 I told all my friends that this is going to reach a million dollars per coin by 2030. As an entrepreneur to find an industry that you can be at the bleeding edge of is what we all strive to find. I was too young to capitalize on the dotcom boom but I realized that bitcoin was my chance and my opportunity.""

It was when Alexandrov started to sell off his bitcoin mining equipment that he realized the appearance of new entrants on the cryptocurrency landscape- these are what are today called altcoin which essentially refers to any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. ""This was around the time when litecoin first came onto the scene and we wanted to accept it in addition to bitcoin"" Alexandrov recalls. ""So we discovered a business called CoinPayments that could facilitate this. We were the 47th merchant on the platform and after using the service and liking it I ended up buying it and moving it to Canada.""

Once again Alexandrov was ahead of the curve here- he saw the potential in altcoin at a time when there wasn't a lot of interest in it at all. ""We entered the sector in 2013 with the pursuit and goal of becoming the dominant payment processor across the planet and to make life easier for everyone to store send and receive payments in digital currencies that we envisioned were the future"" he says. ""Since we couldn't foresee the future direction of crypto we gave every coin an equal chance and if they had the volume we listed them and started using them for payments and wallets for all of our customers to be able to pay with them.""

CoinPayments may have started out small but the company has since grown to become a global payment processor for cryptocurrency and wallet solutions. With Alexandrov acting as the CEO of the enterprise CoinPayments has grown tenfold per year since 2016 with the enterprise stating it currently processes over $2 billion a month in total volume. With more than three million users in total (of which one million are active users) the platform currently accepts 2095 different kinds of cryptocurrencies with its offerings used by more than 70000 merchants in over 200 countries around the world. But for all the success the platform is seeing today it's good for the entrepreneurs reading this to remember how Alexandrov got started on this enterprise in the first place.

""My main motivation to start CoinPayments was that I wanted to do something in the sector and when I found a problem that I wanted to find a solution for that was what sparked that burning interest for me"" he says. ""I think this is very common for most entrepreneurs- for me the trigger was being able to accept an altcoin for my business. CoinPayments was the solution to my problem and we have grown from that initial spark. We didn't make much money for the first few years and it was a lot of work (as it always is) to get to where we are now but it was worth it.""

Much like Alexandrov Shagulyamov has had quite an entrepreneurial bent of mind as well. Shagulyamov started his career by building a payment and technology company in China of which he was Chairman for three years. In 2016 he became acquainted with cryptocurrency and he soon made his first investments into the space. Shortly after he decided to make this into a business where he and his partners in the wealth management sector in Zurich Switzerland created the first crypto international security identification number (ISIN). Later that same year Shagulyamov set up a regulated crypto brokerage firm in the country (which is still active today) and he then went on to organize a large-scale crypto event during the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2017 which brought leaders in the industry together with global leaders and economic powerhouses. This gathering happened through the first major bull run for the sector and this event took the entire crypto realm to a newfound global platform.

Shagulyamov and Alexandrov met on a mega yacht in Monaco where leaders of the crypto industry were invited to network. The like-minded entrepreneurs clicked from the get go and shortly after they teamed up to build the Velas ecosystem. ""Velas was founded in 2019 in Zug Switzerland"" Alexandrov says. ""It's a project designed from the beginning to be an ecosystem in which other solutions can be built at scale. When you compare it to other blockchains in 2019 there weren't many that could handle as many transactions per second or handle a high load of smart contract initiatives.""

Alexandrov explains that Velas came into being after he and his team identified a need in the industry for a fast scalable blockchain on which many services can be built on top of while also integrating cross-chain which refers to the interoperability between two relatively independent blockchains. Velas has thus been built on the idea of decentralized finance (or DeFi as it's more popularly known) with Alexandrov saying that its open-sourced blockchain ecosystem of products and services is an enabler for any kind of tokenization project. ""We also have built something called a ""container system' which allows for the cross-chain deposit and withdrawal of funds from other blockchains"" he adds. ""There are other projects working on this but we differentiate ourselves based on our speed and low transaction costs. Fastest cheapest bestin- class: it's how we do things at Velas.""

It's worth noting here that Velas is an acronym for ""virtual expanding learning autonomous system""- that in itself showcases the sheer range of applications that Alexandrov hopes his enterprise will be able to contribute to. Indeed one of Velas' recent offerings falls in the realm of social media with its aim being to build a more functional version of the popular Telegram platform. ""One of the things we have been developing that I'm really excited about is BitOrbit a decentralized social media platform"" Alexandrov reveals.

""It's a platform that allows users to integrate Telegram group chats on top of native receive and send payment functions. For example if you are an influencer you can take photographs and make them free for everyone but make other content only accessible to paying or subscribed followers all on the blockchain. If you are a musician you can upload some songs or content for free or through a preview feature but charge for full versions of the tracks. We also have a nonfungible token (NFT) market built into the platform. All of this is decentralized and we take zero fees from the platform because we're taking a long-term view: if we can bring value today then in the future global full-scale adoption will naturally ramp up.""

Perhaps one of BitOrbit's most appealing features is the very fact that it is a decentralized platform- something that Alexandrov believes will garner attention from the global internet community. ""We are really excited to build a social media platform that will be censorship- resistant and democratic"" he says. ""This past year has exposed how vulnerable our lives are so we know this is a really timely necessary product and service for people to have at their fingertips."" Much like his mentality around CoinPayments Alexandrov describes Velas' BitOrbit as a platform that he'd actually want to use himself and that is an indication to the tenets that drive him as an entrepreneur today.

""BitOrbit is a social media platform that I would want to personally use"" he says. ""I'm not a big fan of any existing social media platforms so we are building something we can be proud of. The motivation is never the money for me. I could have been sitting on the beach long ago but I love the opportunity to build and meet new people every day. Business occupies all of your mental capacity and there is nothing more exhilarating than being active with my own business or being involved with other businesses at a high level.""

Alexandrov is now planning to continue his entrepreneurial pursuits based out of the Middle East- he's now a resident of Dubai which he says is going to be his (and Velas') home for the foreseeable future. ""The Middle East is a very forwardthinking part of the world that wants to be the definitive global financial and technological hub"" Alexandrov declares. ""Dubai and Abu Dhabi want entrepreneurs to view this part of the world as the new Silicon Valley and they have provided the legal and financial basis to make this possible. It is literally the single best place for any entrepreneur to be even those outside of the crypto sector.""

But that's not to say entrepreneurship here is all roses either- and that's the premise for Alexandrov's advice for entrepreneurs in the region (and beyond). ""Don't be afraid of failure and remember that success is a habit- so balance those two"" he says. ""That is where the magic happens. If you can manage your failures but understand that you have to succeed and continue then this will be the difference between your business making money and you being successful or failing."" According to Alexandrov entrepreneurship is rarely if ever as glamorous as it is often portrayed in mass media and understanding that is critical for one to feel fulfilled after taking on this career path for themselves. ""It is never like you see on the news or in the movies"" he says. ""Very few people are overnight successes. Warren Buffet said it well: ""You can make money or you can gain experience but sooner or later one will be traded for the other.' In entrepreneurship there is nobody else to blame; you have to accept all your failures as your own but you keep learning and keep going always remembering what your goal is- never settle.""

Shagulyamov adds ""The key to success is building a strong and reliable team as well as never ending hard work. A lot of people come to us only after seeing the results that are now evident and they think it's an overnight success. ""There is no such thing' I tell them- every successful business has had at least a few years of hard work and sleepless nights behind it!"" For now however their bets on blockchain are working out for these two entrepreneurs; but ""the best is yet to come!"" Shagulyamov exclaims.

Fully vaccinated baseball fans won’t have to maintain social distancing this weekend at Dodger Stadium.

The Los Angeles Dodgers reigning World Series champs designated two sections of its 56000-seat stadium for fully vaccinated attendees starting Saturday. Guests from different households will be seated next to each other and masks are still required.

To gain entry to the Dodgers-Padres match-up fully vaccinated fans ages 16 and up will need to present proof that at least two weeks have passed since their final vaccine dose. If they’re underage and not eligible to be vaccinated they must prove they tested negative for Covid-19 within the last 72 hours. And if they can’t provide proof they won’t be admitted according to the team.

Dodgers fans who got access to the sections said they were happy to be back at a game.

“We’re just excited to get back in the stadium” said Jonathan Riemer. “This is such an integral part of all of our lives such an important piece of what makes us whole and the fact that we’ve been separated from this experience for so long it means so much for us just to get back in there and be able to celebrate this team this community this culture.”

The Dodgers are one of a few Major League Baseball teams to offer seating for fully vaccinated fans. The San Diego Padres debuted their fully vaccinated section earlier this month and San Francisco Giants launched its special seating on Thursday.

Fans were welcomed back to MLB games across the US this month though most teams have limited capacity staggered seating and still require fans to wear masks except when they’re eating or drinking.

Coronavirus derailed the 2020 MLB regular season pushing back the start date to July and cutting the season down to 60 games. Most teams played to empty stadiums except for the National League Championship Series and the World Series which were held at Globe Life Field where the Texas Rangers play.

The Dodgers’ World Series run was nearly disrupted by a Covid-19 outbreak when star third baseman Justin Turner was pulled mid-game in Game 6 of the World Series. Team officials later revealed he had tested positive for Covid-19 though he joined his teammates on the field – occasionally sans mask – to celebrate their win.

To keep the pandemic from delaying the 2021 regular season – and potentially learn more about Covid-19 variants – the MLB has paired with The Sports Research and Testing Laboratory to regularly test players for Covid-19 variants. Sequencing the different variants is costly and time-consuming but since the MLB is a “microcosm of the US” and players represent a wide variety of locales they make ideal subjects for identifying Covid-19 variants before they begin to dominate in the public.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmUtaXIuaW5mby8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L2EtZ2xvYmFsLW1vdmVtZW50LXRvLWVuZC12aW9sZW5jZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXdvbWVuLWluLXBvbGl0aWNzLWFuZC1wdWJsaWMtbGlmZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Global Movement to End Violence against Women in Politics and Public Life,"Every March the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) brings together international organizations governments politicians and activists from around the world. Over the course of two weeks participants discuss advances and setbacks in gender equality – and place new priorities on the global agenda. In 2021 the CSW theme united two strands of work that until recently were treated separately: women’s political participation and the elimination of violence against women.

In his preparatory report the UN Secretary-General expressed concerns about ‘increasing levels of violence perpetrated against women in public life’ which seek ‘to stop women from accessing power and silence them so as to limit their perspectives in policy formulation.’ In addition to being taken up in plenary sessions the topic of violence against women in politics and public life was also the focus of numerous side events. These vibrant sessions featured women’s testimonies distributed new data and presented emerging solutions to this problem around the world.

Entering the Global Stage

Three parallel campaigns are responsible for bringing global attention to violence against women in politics and public life. In the late 1990s activists around the world began to speak out on violence against women human rights defenders. Following global recognition that ‘women’s rights are human rights’ a growing international network criticized prevailing understandings of violence against human rights defenders centering men and their experience of human rights abuses. This coalition highlighted that violations did not only occur in public spaces at the hand of the state leading to imprisonment and torture; they also took place in private spaces involved non-state actors and could entail violations that were gendered or sexual in nature.

In the late 2000s growing numbers of women elected to political office – due largely to the widespread introduction of gender quotas – sparked global conversations on violence against women in politics and elections. Inspired by women’s experiences on the ground these debates pointed to the limitations of traditional understandings of political violence as acts motivated by policy differences against political opponents. These actors argued in favor of recognizing a second type of political violence one that specifically targeted women in efforts to exclude them as women from participating in political life.

The third strand gaining momentum in the early 2010s concerns violence against women journalists. Building on international recognition of physical violence against journalists as a threat to freedom of expression these discussions highlighted the specific and often overlooked threats faced by women in the profession. These included sexual violence in the field and in the newsroom as well as escalating online attacks that were intended not to address the content of a woman’s reporting but rather to degrade her as a woman.

In my recent book Violence against Women in Politics I argue for joining these strands to unite efforts to address violence as a barrier to the full realization of women’s political and human rights. This multi-sector view is reflected in recent moves by UN actors to embed violence against women in public life into various international frameworks. In 2017 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Violence against Women (CEDAW) Committee issued General Recommendation No. 35 stating that ‘harmful practices and crimes against women human rights defenders politicians activists or journalists are… forms of gender-based violence against women.’ In 2018 the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 73/148 which expressed concerns about ‘all acts of violence including sexual harassment against women and girls involved in political and public life including women in leadership positions journalists and other media workers and human rights defenders.’

Documenting the Problem

Over the last five years an expanding collection of studies have shed light on women’s experiences with violence in the political realm. A 2019 analysis by ACLED found that peaceful protests featuring women disproportionately met with excessive force (live fire) or intervention (arrests and tear gas) than protests involving men or mixed-sex groups.

In 2016 a path-breaking report on violence against women in parliaments published by the Inter-Parliamentary Union revealed that 80% of interviewees had experienced psychological abuse in connection with their political work. And in 2018 a survey of 600 women journalists by the International Women’s Media Foundation revealed that nearly two-thirds had been threatened or harassed online at least once including 10% who had received death threats.

The sheer number of events organized in relation to these topics at this year’s CSW meetings indicates growing global awareness of violence against women in politics and public life. As one panelist noted in a session I attended last month ‘There is no longer any doubt that this problem exists.’

Events of 2020 and 2021 indeed have thrown this issue into even sharper relief. COVID-19 lockdowns have increased the safety-related vulnerabilities of women human rights defenders making it easier for armed actors for example to find and harm women activists. The pandemic has also served as a pretext for restricting women’s ability to protest especially against state-led attacks on women’s rights.

At the same time rising authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics combined with rapidly evolving digital technologies have provided a fertile environment for ‘gendered disinformation’ targeting women politicians and journalists. These attacks draw on gendered and often sexualized tropes to spread false or misleading rumors aimed at humiliating and discrediting women in public life.

Gendered disinformation campaigns are often intersectional disproportionately targeting politicians who are women of color like U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. For journalists like Maria Ressa such campaigns also seek to undermine public trust in their reporting by framing it inaccurately as ‘fake news.’

Mobilizing for Change

The global community is at a vital crossroads in the recognition of violence against women in politics and public life. Growing awareness must now be matched by concrete actions to tackle this problem. In his CSW report the UN Secretary-General offered a series of recommendations: legal reforms reporting mechanisms training and services standards on online abuse and data collection.

Calls for action on this issue are not new. In 2016 the National Democratic Institute (NDI) launched the #NotTheCost campaign to stop violence against women in politics. Its Global Call to Action outlined steps that actors at a variety of levels – international national and local – could take to mitigate this problem. Last month on the fifth anniversary of the campaign NDI issued a Renewed Call to Action with a list of emerging best practices around the world. Expanding global attention provides an unprecedented opportunity to build on this momentum. The first task is to reject arguments that violence is simply a ‘normal’ part of the political process and instead recognize the serious threats posed by this problem to democracy human rights and gender equality. Only then will it be possible to support women’s full equal and safe participation in political life around the globe.

Right-hander Josh Sborz who had been optioned to the alternate site nine days ago was recalled.

Cody who threw 50 pitches in three innings Friday was diagnosed with right shoulder inflammation. The Rangers probably could have given him a couple of days of rest to see if it cleared up but given his history of arm troubles the Rangers wanted to err on the side of caution.

Sborz pitched two scoreless innings Sunday. He had been effective in four of his six outings but was sent out April 16 a day after he threw 20 pitches so the Rangers could activate lefty Joely Rodriguez from the injured list.

Because of Arihara’s short start and the fact that three relievers threw at least 30 pitches the Rangers could find themselves in need of another reliever Monday.

Woodward said the club was in a “bit of a bind” because of usage.

The Rangers have lefty Hyeon-jong Yang and right-hander Hunter Wood on the taxi squad but neither is on the 40-man roster. To get one of them to the big leagues would likely mean moving Ronald Guzman out for the year from the 10-day to 60-day IL.

Lowe’s stirrups: Wearing pants hiked up with a lot of sock showing may be the current fashion rage in major league baseball but Nate Lowe is apparently trying to bring the 80′s back.

For the weekend he donned blue stirrups over white socks and pulled his pants down to mid-shin. It was very reminiscent of say vintage Will Clark who like Lowe attended Mississippi State. It has not caught on with his teammates.

“But I’ve told the team if he hits a homer and we win the game I’m going to make them all wear them that way” manager Chris Woodward said.

British kids have nightmares about the climate. Half of French respondents think it likely that climate change will cause “the extinction of the human race.” American teachers coddle students who have panic attacks when wildfires rage somewhere on the planet. Eco-anxiety has clearly gripped the Western world but what’s worse is that most people have a dismal outlook on all of humanity’s progress not just climate change.

Because slow changes don’t get noticed and because humans use mental shortcuts to understand the world we end up with a grossly misinformed view of what is. The late Hans Rosling the Swedish professor of international health that most of us know as the excited man on YouTube (the one who explains the progress of the world with bubbles and giant blocks) dedicated his life to dispelling these misperceptions. The Gapminder Foundation that now carries on his legacy writes

“Our ignorance surveys have shown that the general public is misguided about many basic global facts. Reliable global statistics exist for nearly every aspect of global development but these numbers are not transformed into popular understanding because using and teaching statistics is still too difficult.”

Gapminder routinely asks 12 questions (sometimes with a thirteenth question on global temperatures which most people tend to get right) about basic uncontroversial changes in global development – multiple-choice questions on things like demographic change how many girls in poor countries finish primary school and what’s happened to extreme poverty in the last twenty years.

The results are terrible but it’s not a question of ignorance. If people genuinely didn’t know by chance alone they’d pick the right answer a third of the time: this is the chimpanzee threshold. Instead the average human gets 2.2 answers right. The results for some questions like global life expectancy (50 60 or 70 years?) ought to scare us more than any dismal vision of climate change. Having more than doubled since 1900 the global improvements in the last forty years seem to have passed most smart people by. Of students and faculty at top universities less than one in five manage to get this right – even Nobel Laureates underperform the chimps. The worst-performing groups were Swedish trade unionists (10% got the answer right) and Norwegian teachers (7% correct). In one memorable lecture Rosling animatedly exclaimed “What in the world are you teaching the kids?!”

In that one line lies much of the problem for our continued misinformation about the world.

Media coverage inundates us with a constant flow of catastrophes from one part or the world or another while overlooking the great non-events of the world. When super cyclones kill 128 people instead of the hundreds of thousands they used to or would have we don’t even hear about them. When hundreds of thousands of people are lifted out of extreme poverty a day every day that’s no longer newsworthy. The result is Gapminder notes that “people end up carrying around a sack of outdated facts that you got in school (including knowledge that often was outdated when acquired in school).”

Counteracting that requires information and an updated framework for thinking about the world. To embrace the notion that things gradually get better – not worse – as we solve more problems invent better things and bring more people into the global marketplace. The return of such an optimist mentality (Rosling prefers ‘possibilist’) requires nothing more than accepting that “facts are better than myths – especially for understanding the world.”

Thou shalt not misinform

To say that the world is getting better is not to be complacent about its problems. It is not to be Pollyannaish about the future or believe that from here the only way is up. It’s to say that on net and over time the world gets better. It’s to say that progress is hard-earned; that it’s a gradual process with deep structural and historical roots; that the small heavens we may create in our own lives combine to make the entire world slightly less bad than it was yesterday. I work for you doing what I’m good at; you work for me doing what you’re good at – and inventors and entrepreneurs halfway around the world figure out ways to do things that make both our lives better.

This isn’t a predetermined path and it most certainly isn’t always up. Last year was a setback in just about every way we know how to measure (mortality life expectancy poverty). The twentieth century saw some of humanity’s worst atrocities: world wars genocide autocrats. Sometimes progress pauses and sometimes our past progress gives rise to new challenges we have yet to overcome – like the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere from the coal and oil we burned for (great!) use as fuel production and transportation.

While that’s a global challenge to talk seriously about with our children we don’t have to overdo it. Imbuing them with mistaken doom-mongering helps nobody. When we do we’re not setting up the next generation for a flourishing world or even a factful one.

Nobody told these kids that wildfires destroy less area now than they used to and forests in California burned much more before Europeans arrived. Deaths from natural disasters those like storms hurricanes and floods that we usually associate with worsening climate change are massively down over almost any time frame even though we are many more people on the planet. Child mortality is falling everywhere around the globe and we produce more food than we ever have. None of those trends are about to suddenly stop reverse and undo the progress we’ve already made.

What is the point of studying when the world is collapsing around us?

This is a point that many schoolchildren have raised Greta Thunberg perhaps most prominently. The world is heading for an urgent climate disaster so why should they study for a future they won’t have?

One reason would be to learn that the world isn’t collapsing that things are getting better – even though the pandemic coverage and climate change alarmism seem to suggest otherwise. Disasters are quick and sudden; progress is slow and hard-won. We live longer healthier safer better and more fulfilling lives with better access to almost anything you can imagine. So far human ingenuity has outpaced anything that a hostile planet has thrown at us or a declinist mentality has conjured up.

In all this mess thankfully there’s at least one thing you can do: imbue your child not with the dangers of the world but with the factful progress of the world. This is what Tony Morley a fellow traveler and prominent advocate for progress is doing: Targeted at 6-to-12-year-olds Morley is bringing together a hundred one-page stories about the forces the people and the astonishing history of how humans have progressed and collectively improved our global living standards. Human Progress for Beginners tries to

“tell the dramatic history of human civilization and the jagged upward path of improved living standards in the last 250 years. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution civilization has experienced the greatest increase in living standards prosperity and well-being in our species’ history. […] Human Progress for Beginners will tell the untold story of progress for young readers in a bright and engaging book the likes of which has never been attempted.”

Chapters span the innovations that rocked our world: the printing presses steam power and combustion engines; the history of living standards of light and of food; and the progress of literacy peace and pollution.

“Progress forward” Morley emphasizes “is not progress completed” and our world certainly has room for improvement. But that’s not reason enough to despair and invoke the doom-and-gloom zeitgeist of “civilizational decline” “apocalypse” or “climate emergency.” Instead we ought to celebrate our achievements even in the areas that many of our young people now believe are irrevocably destroyed.

It’s a counterintuitive notion and a difficult thing to wrap one’s head around that the world can both be better and is still in many respects bad. We do nobody any favors least of all our children by exaggerating one while forgetting how far we’ve come."
GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGVzZS1pbmR1c3RyaWVzLWFyZS1oaXQtaGFyZGVzdC1ieS10aGUtZ2xvYmFsLWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtMTIyODU0MjUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 169 industries are being hit by the global chip shortage,"The ongoing global chip shortage has roiled the automotive and consumer technology industries for months. But the ripple effects of the crisis which could last into 2022 stretch far beyond automakers idling plants and consumers waiting longer for the latest gaming consoles.

According to an analysis by Goldman Sachs (GS) the semiconductor shortage touches a mind-blowing 169 industries in some way. We’re talking everything from steel product and ready-mix concrete manufacturing to industries that build air conditioning systems and refrigerators to breweries. Even soap manufacturing is impacted by the chip crisis.

The graphic below breaks down the various industries that are dealing with the shortage.

To determine which industries were hit by the shortage Goldman Sachs looked at each industry’s’ need for microchips and related components as a share of their GDP. Industries that spend more than 1% of their GDP on chips the firm says will be impacted by the semiconductor shortfall.

For reference in the automotive sector 4.7% of industry GDP is spent on microchips and related semiconductors on this basis according to Goldman.

The automotive industry has been particularly burned by the chip shortage due to the way its supply chain works. Automakers tend to run incredibly lean on supplies for vehicles to keep costs down. But the coronavirus pandemic upended that entire system.

When the pandemic began automakers figuring consumers would slow down auto purchases cut down on their supplies of semiconductors used in everything from their vehicles’ infotainment systems to high-end driver-assistance technologies.

But consumer interest in vehicle purchases rebounded faster than the automakers had predicted. And by Q4 of 2020 they were outpacing Q4 2019 sales numbers. At the same time factories remained idling due to coronavirus restrictions putting automakers even further behind.

While that was happening people around the world began buying up consumer technology goods to adjust to the pandemic induced work-from-home and remote learning environments. With automakers not purchasing chips semiconductor makers started working on chips for consumer tech products.

Once the automakers realized they needed more chips than they thought the chipmakers were already dedicating time to making chips for consumer tech companies. Now both industries are struggling for support from the limited number of global semiconductor manufacturers that can meet their needs.

Chips aren’t exactly easy to make either with advanced semiconductors taking up to 6 months to produce. According to Goldman Sachs’ Spencer Hill the semiconductor shortfall could wallop U.S. GDP by as much as 1% despite the uptick in consumer spending as lockdown orders continue to ease.

Story continues

“Some computer chips have no available substitute and if output of every product that uses chips were to decline proportionately the drag on 2021 GDP would be around 1%” Hill wrote in a research note.

While that prediction may sound dire Hill says the true impact on GDP will likely be milder with GDP taking a 0.5% as companies that are able to use different available chips make adjustments to their needs.

The chip crisis is still far from over however and as industry leaders and politicians work to ease the strain on manufacturers across the country consumer goods will still cost more as a result with Goldman predicting a 1% to 3% jumping in prices.

In other words if you’re in need of a car or some kind of laptop or other piece of consumer tech now is the time to buy — if you can find them.

Kevin Kirksey is growing his career where it began – ALM First Financial Advisors.

ALM First founded in 1995 focuses on financial advisory services for credit union clients. Kirksey joined the firm in 2011 building financial models for two years.

He took a year-long hiatus from the company to work on Goldman Sachs’ mortgage trading desk. He analyzed whole loan trades and securitizations and performed mortgage valuations for various capital raises mergers and IPOs.

“My parents clients and mentors in peer groups helped me further cultivate a mission orientation and navigate me through my professional journey.”

After that CFA Emily Hollis allowed Kirksey to return to ALM First as a manager and he hired his first employee.

“Since then I obsessed over curating a high-performing team from operations and technology to client service and M&A” he said. “My parents clients and mentors in peer groups helped me further cultivate a mission orientation and navigate me through my professional journey as ALM First continued to augment and enhance its service offerings and client base.”

Now Kirksey is a principal with the firm overseeing the Strategic Solutions Group which conducts merger and acquisition services capital planning and stress testing ALM and CPST model validations CECL analysis and ALM reporting. Additionally Kevin oversees the operations and technology departments.

The company’s continued to grow and Kirksey said he hired two managing directors in December.

When he’s not working he enjoys supporting nonprofits including Dallas Pets Alive! where he serves on the board. The agency provides resources education and programs aimed at eliminating the killing of companion animals in North Texas.”

Morgan Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are three of the banks who have taken the lead on using APIs for global banking

With companies expanding into new regions and doing more trade with the rest of the world than ever before global transaction banking has become critical to their success.

Traditionally major banks have provided these essential services covering everything from transfers payments and cash and asset management to financing and global trade.

It’s a money spinner that generates almost $1 trillion in global annual revenues and is expected to grow to $7.2 trillion in ten years according to industry estimates.

Previously banks had relied on legacy systems and technologies such as host-to-host file transfer to integrate their services with clients’ systems. However while working well for single-step transactions they struggle with more complicated real-time functionalities such as reconciliation trade services collections and supply chain finance.

In the face of increasing competition from more nimble rivals notably fintechs and digital banks banking institutions have had to up their game. Enter business-to-business (B2B) application programming interfaces (APIs) which enable banks to simplify transactions and provide clients with a seamless service.

Why use APIs in global banking?

But what are the key challenges involved in migrating to this new technology and how can banks overcome them? What has been the effect of regulation? And how can they capitalise on the biggest growth areas?

APIs work in closed networks that integrate banks’ services with their clients’ enterprise systems and workflows. They allow banks to scale complex operations and eliminate the need for brokers or service bureaus.

Banks including Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan and the Bank of America have already taken the lead. Yet as a technology it’s still in its relative infancy with a lack of clearly defined industry standards and is restricted by clunky infrastructure and governance protocols.

What are the drawbacks of APIs?

The biggest challenge is in developing a platform that is both user friendly and compatible with clients’ systems. Too many APIs however are let down by poor or overcomplicated designs due to lack of development expertise.

“API banking is a product with unique design constraints and challenges in the same way mobile or web banking are” says David Jarvis co-founder and chief executive of Griffin a banking-as-a-service provider. “You need to build out that expertise internally and none of the banks have invested in this to date.”

They also need to be fully secure well documented and meet ever-evolving regulatory changes. Then there is the considerable cost involved too as well as overhaul of existing systems and processes.

To overcome these issues banks must embrace technology and change with a dedicated team focused on developing a strategy and rigorously testing their APIs. They should also collaborate with clients and partners including fintechs thus spreading the cost of innovation and reducing time to market.

How to implement APIs properly

As an absolute basic first step banks need to invest in a digital banking platform that links their gateway and product processors and functions to enable their APIs. That platform informs all the modification authentication authorisation and consent-management capabilities as well as connecting multiple information sources.

Société Générale has achieved this by building its B2B SG Markets platform. It provides everything from cash management financing and security services to global markets and private banking.

“By implementing machine learning and combining our cash management and FX [foreign exchange] within our platform we have created a one-stop shop” says Société Générale’s head of execution platforms and UK chief digital officer Sohail Raja. “It enables clients to do everything from managing their transactions to taking cash positions on different currencies.”

Citi meanwhile has partnered with treasury software providers including FIS Kyriba Oracle and SAP to embed its API functionalities into their core products. This month its CitiConnect platform reached one billion calls from corporate clients since its launch in 2017 while API volume grew 60 per cent in 2020.

“APIs are great for real-time treasury services to enable our clients to have the most optimal digital banking experience” says Mayank Mishra managing director and global head of digital channels at Citi treasury and trade solutions. “Open banking is an extension of this but one that helps enable an entire market or industry vertical.”

UniCredit has also teamed up with FinDynamic to build its platform which allows clients to automatically view invoices through a web-based or mobile platform and approve invoices for payment. In September 2020 it launched the first open banking API with an IBAN check to enable clients to verify their customers’ account details.

Open banking innovation

The move to APIs is being fuelled by open banking regulations such as the European Union’s Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the introduction of the United Payments Interface in India. PSD2 has required banks to release their data in a secure standardised form so it can be readily shared between authorised parties online.

“Industry needs like smart personalisation and corporate banking are driving the conversation beyond banking directives now” says Vikram Gupta global vice president at Oracle Financial Services. “These capabilities need access to premium information beyond regulatory mandates that give banks an opportunity to tap into new revenue streams and provide better services to their customers as well maintain customer stickiness.”

How new tech is supporting global transaction banking

Simultaneously artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have vastly improved risk and liquidity analytics and forecasting within treasury management systems. Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have also driven the digitalisation of trade and supply chain finance.

“Banks need to accept that the future of finance is decentralised and integrate blockchain and AI into their overall digital transformation strategy” says Inpay’s head of financial institutions Stan Cole. “They can remain a central part of society by capitalising on the tremendous opportunities technology brings in terms of an incomparably higher speed and lower cost.”

The biggest growth areas over the next three years will be cash management and trade finance. More than 85 per cent of respondents to a McKinsey survey plan to invest in cash management APIs in the next three years and almost 50 per cent want to expand their trade finance APIs.

Banks can support this by upgrading their API capabilities to allow clients to initiate self-service transactions directly. They can also cater to clients in different time zones with real-time payment processing liquidity risk and fraud management cash-flow forecasting reporting and pricing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIxMDQyNTAwMDE2M9IBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjEwNDI1MDAwMTYz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[News Focus] Why are foreign financial firms pulling out of South Korea?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.koreaherald.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /view.php?ud=20210425000163 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C4977FE3D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11002] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIxMDQyNTAwMDE2M9IBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjEwNDI1MDAwMTYz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The world’s biggest oilfield contractor joined rivals Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Co. this week in predicting expansion in overseas work and a more muted recovery in North America through the rest of 2021. Global oil demand should return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year if not sooner Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch told analysts on Friday.

“A new growth cycle has finally commenced” he said in a statement released on Friday. “There is an increasingly positive sentiment in the industry outlook as the recovery strengthens despite the lingering concerns regarding the Covid-19 crisis.”

The service sector that helps oil explorers detect and drill underground reserves is slowly returning to work after a global glut and pandemic-led lockdowns sapped energy demand triggering job cuts and bankruptcies across the industry. The big three contractors who this week posted better-than-expected first-quarter results are pivoting away from the once-booming North American shale patch and chasing work elsewhere instead.

Schlumberger said it expects an increase in U.S. onshore activity in the second quarter that will level off during the second half. But international activity is poised to continue ramping up through the end of this year and beyond.

Sales are expected to grow by mid-single digits this quarter while operating margins probably will expand by as much a percentage point Chief Financial Officer Stephane Biguet said during the call.

The shares which have climbed more than 50% in the past year rose 1.9% to $25.73 at 10:58 a.m. in New York.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Schlumberger’s sales of its North American completion and artificial-lift businesses increase its focus on overseas markets which may account for 80% of revenue in 2021. ... The balance sheet should support its reduced dividend payout though buybacks are unlikely until the pandemic subsides. -- Scott J. Levine and Justin Rothhaupt BI analysts Read the report here.

Le Peuch has cut tens of thousands of workers reshuffled the company’s business around the globe and sold off assets in North America in order to focus on overseas work. The service provider expects to generate about 80% of sales from international markets.

The company continues to work on a pair of asset sales including drilling rigs in the Middle East and a business in Canada that shares in the ownership of wells Le Peuch said.

The first-quarter results reflect Schlumberger’s shifting strategy with its lowest North American sales output since the start of the shale boom roughly a decade ago. While a seasonal drop in international revenue from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is typical Schlumberger said the 3% sequential drop during the quarter was its shallowest since 2008.

Meanwhile Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller told investors on Wednesday that early signs of an international recovery are already showing up in orders for tools.

“These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year” Miller said. “We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L2xlZ2FsL2ZvcmNlLW1hamV1cmUtaG93LXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtaGFzLXRoZS1sYXctYmVlbi1wb3N0LWNvdmlkLWluLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgyMjI3MzM4LmNtc9IBigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L2xlZ2FsL2ZvcmNlLW1hamV1cmUtaG93LXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtaGFzLXRoZS1sYXctYmVlbi1wb3N0LWNvdmlkLWluLWluZGlhL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjIyNzMzOC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Force Majeure: How successful has the law been post Covid in India,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Enrollment had dropped at UHart even before the 2020-21 school year numbers from the school indicate a product of the university’s struggle to compete for a declining pool of college applicants. The result industry observers say has been a decline in tuition revenue that has strained the campus and forced cuts.

It is against that backdrop that UHart led by president Gregory Woodward commissioned a report on potential paths forward for the athletic department — a report that ultimately recommended the school save money by moving to Division III.

The study has drawn outrage from current and former UHart athletes who argue that sports bring value to a university beyond dollars and cents as well as from critics who say the report may overstate the potential savings from a move to Division III. Dozens of students marched through campus Monday to advocate against the proposed change while hundreds of alumni have signed petitions demanding that the school remain in Division I.

Advocates of shifting to Division III say UHart should focus as many resources as possible on its academic mission rather than continue to underwrite a relatively modest Division I sports program.

Either way the broader issues facing the school are undeniable and inescapable say those who follow the university closely including former administrators.

“The real problem at the university is that they have declining enrollment and because of declining enrollment they have declining revenue” says Michael Gargano a former administrator at UHart and elsewhere who now counsels university boards of trustees. “And it is impacting all operations of which athletics is a small part of it.”

Since news of the report was leaked in early April Woodward has remained largely silent. A UHart spokesperson said senior university leadership would not be made available for interviews.

Declining enrollment

Like many colleges the University of Hartford has seen its enrollment decline sharply in recent years — a trend that began long before the pandemic. According to figures from the university’s factbook undergraduate enrollment dropped about 14% from the fall of 2015 to the fall of 2020 and total enrollment was down about 6.5% during that period.

That means UHart currently has about 700 fewer undergraduates and about 450 fewer students overall than it did just six years ago. In other words fewer paying customers and likely less revenue.

“For tuition-driven universities like the University of Hartford any decline in student enrollment creates a crisis” Gargano said.

This decline has various potential explanations. Walter Harrison who served as UHart’s president from 1998-2017 noted that the number of college-aged students in the region has declined in recent years and that spending power among those families has declined due to widening inequality.

“This is a challenge all colleges and universities face not just the University of Hartford” he said. “Fewer kids college-aged in the Northeast and the ones who are college-aged come from families with lower incomes than the comparable number would have come from 10 years ago.”

With declining demand UHart’s acceptance rate has increased in recent years now standing at 76% according to U.S. News. The typical accepted student has an SAT score between 1030 and 1230 or an ACT between 22 and 27.

Jennifer Widness president of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges pointed to a recent study showing Connecticut was one of the only states to experience a decline in annual college graduates from 2013-18 as neighboring states showed only modest increases.

This trend is expected to worsen in coming years. The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education projected late last year that the number of new high school graduates in New England will drop 12.5% by 2037 limiting the pool of applicants for regional schools like UHart.

Already the United States as a whole has seen an increase in college closures which analysts attribute to stagnant middle-class wages and a workforce that emphasizes technical training over liberal-arts education.

Gargano though says UHart’s issues can’t be blamed entirely on shifting demographics and broader industry headwinds noting that other Connecticut schools have not experienced such significant dips in enrollment.

“Students are going to UConn they are going to Central Connecticut they’re going to Southern Connecticut they’re going to Sacred Heart they’re going to Fairfield they’re going to all these other universities” he said. “So to say there are no students that hypothesis would not hold water.”

Data from the state Office of Higher Education shows enrollment in recent years has held steady at schools such as Fairfield Sacred Heart and the University of New Haven but has dropped at others including some of Connecticut’s public universities.

One solution to declining enrollment is to lower admission standards or discount tuition. But Gargano says the university should instead seek to improve its academic programming.

“They have to improve the quality of the academic experience” he said.

In an email Saturday UHart spokesperson Molly Polk said the university faced challenges including “heavy competition a declining number of traditional-aged prospective students and continued concerns about the cost of college and the impact of student debt.”

Polk said the school had undertaken $27.5 million in capital improvements in recent years building several new buildings and expanding or renovating others.

“Our Board and leadership recognize the need to continue to make intentional investments in our students and in areas like access and affordability in-demand academic programs residential life facilities and experiences athletics student support services health and wellness and career preparation” she said.

COVID problems

Whatever issues UHart had before the COVID-19 pandemic have likely been exacerbated since as enrollment has dropped sharply and expenses have piled up.

And although these dynamics might improve as the coronavirus fades the pandemic could have a lasting impact. Moody’s Investor Service reported in December that the higher education sector’s 2021 outlook “remains negative” projecting that operating revenue at colleges nationwide will be down 5-10% this year.

“All colleges and universities have had their finances severely strained by the pandemic” Harrison said. “Some institutions are doing OK but many many institutions are struggling.”

Though many colleges including UHart have received federal aid as part of recent relief packages that money is not intended to fully offset pandemic-related losses.

English professors Bryan Sinche and William Major had seen cuts across the university long before the pandemic.

Major watched theater programming disappear within UHart’s Hillyer College where he chairs the English Department. Sinche is currently chair of the Department of English and Modern Languages which used to be three different departments until cuts within the past decade forced them to merge. That means he oversees not only the study of English but also the study of Spanish French and other languages.

Then came the pandemic when Woodward initiated furloughs and eventually layoffs to offset revenue declines. The results Sinche said were painful.

“You have long-serving and quality employees who were let go for purely budgetary reasons as part of the crisis” Sinche said. “Certainly a lot of those people could still be there if different decisions were made.”

Sports under fire

Given these challenges the athletic department may seem ripe for significant cuts — and some believe UHart’s future would best be served by investing in improved academics instead of supporting Division I sports.

Sinche said he’s glad to see that corner of the university — which may be untouchable at some schools — coming under scrutiny. Given the passion often surrounding athletics blowback to the prospect of moving to Division III was predictable.

“I appreciate that people are thinking about the budget in its totality instead of taking certain parts of the university and saying ‘These are sacrosanct and we can’t touch them’ ” he said. “Because from my point of view other parts of the university should be held even more sacrosanct.”

Michael Leeds a sports economist at Temple University said plenty of schools have begun to cut back their athletic departments whether that means eliminating sports or dropping levels.

“I can’t blame them quite frankly” he said. “Unless you are in a major conference with big-time football there’s a good chance you’re going to lose money.”

UHart is relatively small for a Division I school ranking in the bottom quartile of total enrollment including last in its conference.

Others however question whether moving from Division I to Division III would truly solve UHart’s problems. A new report commissioned by advocates of the school remaining in Division I accuses the original UHart report of overstating the true savings the school might derive from shifting divisions echoing arguments from several industry figures.

Meanwhile defenders of the athletic program argue that shifting to Division III would diminish exposure school spirit and fundraising. They say the men’s basketball team’s first NCAA Tournament appearance last month could be a jumping-off point for engaging alumni.

“I know so many people who have regained interest in the university simply because of the joy of seeing the team play on TV for two and a half hours” said Bob Chernak a consultant who was involved in UHart’s initial decision to join Division I in the 1980s.

The university’s report conducted by CarrSports Consulting noted “potential public relations issues with moving to Division III” and Chernak said the effect in that area could be dramatic.

“It gives the appearance of a major retreat to a lot of your alumni and donors” Chernak said.

Harrison said he’d prefer to see the university look for places across the university where expenses might be trimmed before resorting to more dramatic action.

“Are there places here where we can economize? It doesn’t matter whether it’s a school or college or the library or residence halls or facilities or athletics” he said. “And then if that doesn’t work they can demonstrate that they gave it the old college try.”

The future of UHart’s athletic department could be determined at an upcoming Board of Trustees meeting when advocates on both sides of the Division I vs. Division III dispute will have their say.

To Gargano however the debate about sports is beside the point. The university he says faces deep fundamental issues regardless of what level its teams play at.

“The issue here is not athletics” Gargano said. “Unless they address the enrollment and the revenue that comes from enrollment then you can’t solve any of the problems this institution has.”

State Street in Hartford has a new corporate owner.

Tom Hostad executive director of the Hartford Area Development Corporation confirmed the sale to Madison Industries.

He spoke with Broan-NuTone company president Frank Carroll. “He indicated Madison Industries is a very large privately-held company with 10000 employees worldwide” said Hostad. “Madison Industries owns about 28 companies and their specialty is indoor air quality.”

According to Hostad Nortek Air owned Broan for probably 30-plus years and then Nortek was purchased by Melrose Industries PLC and it formed three operating groups from all the Nortek companies; the Nortek Air group included Broan-NuTone.

Nortek was acquired by Melrose Industries in July 2016.

NuTone holds major market positions in doorbells central vacuum systems kitchen exhaust range hoods bathroom ventilation fans and mosquito repellent systems.” Courtesy Broan-NuTone

As far as how Hartford will be affected by the sale Hostad said the community will not really notice any change.

“This is all going to be very positive. There won’t be any job loss or work moving out of Hartford” said Hostad.

“Broan is a very very strong company that produces a lot of profits for whomever might own them and they are experiencing a real surge in business right now due to new home construction and home remodeling.”

Broan-NuTone employs about 800 people in the City of Hartford. The company in the Hartford industrial park.

Hostad who used to work at Broan was not surprised by the sale. “Melrose is a private-equity firm that has a reputation for buying good-performing companies like Broan and then giving them an opportunity to grow increase in value and then sell them. Everyone knew when Melrose bought Broan there would be a sale in Broan’s future again.”

Carroll ’24

News Editor

Trinity Alum and Fox News television host Tucker Carlson ‘91 has recently faced public criticism after a screenshot of his Trinity College yearbook photo went viral on social media earlier this week.

The controversy began on the morning of Wednesday Apr. 21 after journalist Travis Akers tweeted an image of Carlson’s 1991 yearbook portrait with the caption “Perhaps this is the story that @TuckerCarlson was trying to get ahead of.” Aker noted that “In his college yearbook he listed himself as a member of the ‘Dan White Society.’ Dan White was the man who murdered Harvey Milk.”

Akers’ tweet appears to have been alluding to a Tuesday Apr. 20 episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight in which Carlson spoke out against Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple stating that “Jeff Bezos (owner of the Washington Post) had one of his minions a mentally unbalanced middle-aged man called Erik Wemple pull out our dusty college yearbook and call around and see if we’d done anything naughty at the age of 19….Let us know if you hear any good stories.” Also in the same clip Carlson indicated that he had been in contact with “quite a few old college classmates in some cases people we’ve been out of touch with for thirty years” since Wemple had been reaching out to them.

Shortly after his tweet went viral many public figures joined Aker in accusing Carlson of paying tribute to the American politician Dan White who served as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978. During that same year White shot and killed two people including his fellow supervisor Harvey Milk who was the first openly gay politician to be elected in the state of California. In a controversial 1979 court verdict White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter (for which he served a five-year prison sentence) as opposed to first-degree murder in the deaths of Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.

Responding to Akers’ tweet the conservative political action committee formed in 2019 to prevent the re-election of former President Donald Trump The Lincoln Project commented “Oh Tucker…..”

In a reply to The Lincoln Project Carl M. Loeb Professor Emeritus at Harvard Law School Lawrence Tribes tweeted “So grim. Here’s #TuckerCarlson basically celebrating the homophobic murder of San Francisco Board of Supervisors #HarveyMilk just for being gay and proud of it back in the day.” Tribes added that “Poor Harvey is dead while evil Tucker is still spewing hate and fomenting hateful violence.”

Retweeting Tribes’ post former Secretary of the U.S. Navy under the Obama administration Ray Maybus noted that “#HarveyMilk was a Navy diver (1 of toughest there is) who was kicked out for being openly gay. Made our Navy weaker. I named a ship after #HarveyMilk bec/ he represented our values & he served. Still trying to learn which branch #TuckerCarlson served in.”

A representative for Trinity College reportedly confirmed the veracity of Carlson’s yearbook photo to TheWrap after a screenshot of it went viral on Twitter. Also the same article reported that a Trinity spokesperson told TheWrap that the Dan White Society did not appear to exist at the College and that the society was only referenced in Carlson’s yearbook caption. After reviewing the yearbook TheWrap claimed that it found no other references to the Dan White Society. The Tripod was also unable to find additional references.

Carlson’s yearbook reference to the “Jesse Helms Foundation” has also been under scrutiny as well. On its website the Helms Center Foundation claims that the organization aspires to be “one of our nation’s leading advocates of free enterprise and traditional American values through education public policy promotion and historical preservation.” However when reporting on Carlson’s yearbook photo many sources have reported that Senator Jesse Helms (to whom the center is dedicated) opposed homosexuality AIDS funding civil rights and abortion during his career as a politician.

As of Sunday Apr. 25 Carlson had not responded directly to the veracity of the accusations or the positions they asserted."

This is due to now having the five core Rangers from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 3 with their sparkling appearance. The Metallic Rangers was one of the first ‘Mode’ changes in Power Rangers however it only appeared in 5 episodes and hasn’t been seen since.

Fans have now had the opportunity to add to their Collection Red Ranger Rocky Blue Ranger Billy Black Ranger Adam and Yellow Ranger Aisha in their metallic Ranger Form. With Pink Ranger Kat being added earlier to the Lightning Collection line. Although we got the other 4 in one wave it still left out White Ranger Tommy which is needed to complete the collection.

In the first season of Power Rangers every fan knows that Tommy played by Jason David Frank was originally the Green Ranger in the show. Due to the story and a limited range of Green Ranger footage Tommy eventually lost his powers however that didn’t stop the character from returning due to fan demand. So Tommy came back in Season Two but now as the White Ranger. The new White Ranger was then made leader of the team instead of Red which was a result of his popularity.

Hasbro Toy Designer Josh Warden Discusses Tommy In The Lightning Collection

Metallic Armor White Ranger © Hasbro

Josh Warden a Hasbro Designer is certainly aware of his popularity and responded to the Tommy hype and Lightning Collection desire in the fandom.

John Warden: “I know everybody wants to have more Tommy figures. There’s never enough Tommy. I guess stay tuned.”

Although Tommy has always been a popular character in the franchise it’s interesting the Lightning Collection team of Hasbro has yet to confirm when the new figure will be released. With a recent interview with the Illuminerdi we also learned more about their decision to choose the Metallic Rangers and the Zeo Crystals that came with them.

John Warden: “That’s the cool thing about having a capsule program: it allows us to build out that universe. We keep thinking about when is the right time to introduce those characters. That’s the cool thing about the Zeo crystal in general; it’s this awesome MacGuffin piece from season 3 of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. It breaks up in a way that as you collect these metallic Rangers you’re getting a glow-in-the-dark crystal that you can start to build your own Zeo crystal with. That’s a lot of fun.”

As for the White Metallic Ranger Warden only had this to say when questioned about the desired release.

John Warden: “So yeah any opportunity for us to do more Tommy. We heard it hear from Joe: make more Tommy figures.”

Likely it won’t be too long until we complete the Lightning Collection Metallic Rangers but it does seem like The Hasbro team behind it is making sure it’s worth the wait. If you wish to see the full interview with the Hasbro Lightning Collection team use the link below.

But there it is embossed on both sides advertising Hershey’s Ice Cream—which despite the similar lettering apparently has nothing to do with Hershey’s Chocolate.

How long has the sign been there? No earlier than 1940 as it doesn’t appear in the tax photo from that year archived by the New York City Department of Records and Information Services. This stretch of the Bowery back then was all hardware stores sign makers and a low-rent hotel called the Gotham.

However old it is this it’s a charming relic of a time when the Bowery made room for a deli or luncheonette with ice cream on the menu. It might qualify as a “privilege” sign—a store sign featuring a brand’s name and logo and typically the name of the store. The store owners didn’t have to pay for the sign because it was free advertising for the brand.

To see a clearer image of the sign visit the Facebook group Ghost Signs—this snap was taken by Tori Terazzi back in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc3Rvcmllcy5oZXJzaGV5cGEuY29tL211c3QtdHJ5LXNwcmluZy1jb2NrdGFpbHMtaW4taGVyc2hleS1wYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Must-Try Spring Cocktails in Hershey PA,"Restaurants across Hershey PA may be known for their line of signature Hershey's Chocolate Martinis.

You could opt for the classic chocolate bar or you could try something different to make a night around the fire even better. How? With the new Hershey’s S’mores Variety Kit.



The box is filled with three chocolate bars — a Reese’s Bar that’s stuffed with peanut butter Hershey’s Cookies ‘n’ Creme Bar and Hershey’s Creamy Milk Chocolate Bar — one bag of marshmallows and two packs of graham crackers. You’ll have everything you need to make 18 s’mores in three different varieties.

Now here’s the only catch about the Hershey’s S’mores Variety kit. It’s not available in the U.S. but it is in Canada. But if you don’t have plans to hit up a Walmart Canada any time soon there is another option for getting your hands on it. You can snag a box on Amazon for three times the original price but hey desperate times call for desperate measures.

Even if you don’t think you want to make s’mores right now it’s not a bad idea to keep a kit in your home for an impromptu fire pit night or when you need a fun activity for the kids. Let’s put it this way: A box full of Reese’s and Hershey’s bars will not go to waste.

She came close to doing so.

The initial time had her clocked in at a 57.4 which would have been enough to not only achieve that goal but also smash her previous personal best of 58.4.

The official time had her at 58.88 seconds. While she didn’t get her goal she still left with a new invitational record beating out the previous time of 58.90 that was set by Perkins County’s Jenni Sis in 2008.

She won by a lot too. When she crossed the finish line the other racers were almost 10 seconds behind.

“Last year without a track season it kind of made me realize I like to get out and compete” McNair said. “And so (I’m not) taking that for granted and just give it (my) all.”

McNair’s performance helped the Chase County girls track and field team pull out a win at the Mike Troxel Invitational on Saturday in Hershey. The Longhorns collected 183 points while St. Pat’s came in second with 112.5 and South Loup finished third with 109.5.

Chase County also won the boys side with 149. St. Pat’s was right behind with 138 and Perkins County came in third with 88.

McNair didn’t just dominate in the 400 she also won the 800-meter run by over 25 seconds won the high jump with a jump of 5 feet 4 inches and anchored the winning 4x400 meter relay team.

As for the 400-meter run McNair is still looking to break 58 seconds and earn all-state honors.

“The only thing that I knew was to come out strong” she said. “We worked on box yesterday and got that down. Just use your arms on the last 100 and just finish it.”

St. Pat’s Caleb Munson attempted a personal-best 6-foot jump in the high jump but narrowly missed out on his third attempt.

His final score of 5-10 was enough to earn the win over Hershey’s Samuel Frame who jumped a personal-best 5-8. Munson said he reached that score two times already this year and Saturday’s jump was the closest he has come to reaching 6 feet.

With a few more meets left in the season before district Munson is confident he will reach that next milestone.

“For sure I will be able to make it” Munson said. “I’ll probably just continue to come to the track every other day just to jump and keep getting that experience at those higher heights.”

Munson also competes in the 110-meter hurdles and the long jump and while he said he didn’t have his best day at the long jump he still placed third in the hurdles by .06 seconds.

South Loup’s Drew Vickers another competitor in the hurdles recorded the fastest time in the 110-meter hurdles prelims at 16.74 but he also made note that he tweaked his Achilles earlier in the week. He didn’t do as well in the finals falling out of the Top 6 but his time in the prelims still ranked as the quickest of the day.

“It’s still a little sore and hurts so I know I didn’t run as good as I could’ve” Vickers said after the prelims.

(Reuters) – India the world’s third-largest crude consumer and importer has approached Guyana’s government about a possible long-term deal to buy the South American country’s oil a Guyanese official said.

India has expressed interest in buying one of the 1 million-barrel cargoes Guyana’s government is entitled to in order to test the crude in its refineries according to Guyana’s Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat. If the crude is compatible the parties could begin talks on a long-term arrangement.

India’s oil demand has risen by 25% in the last seven years more than any other country and officials there have pledged to use the country’s position as a leading purchaser as a “weapon” in an effort to keep prices low.

New Delhi is already exercising its growing clout in the crude market. It viscerally opposed a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies known as OPEC+ to extend production cuts that have lifted the price of oil and is seeking to diversify its purchases away from top producer Saudi Arabia.

State refiners plan to buy 36% less oil from Saudi Arabia in May than normal sources told Reuters and the country is now attempting to swap out Saudi supply with new origins like Guyana.

Private Indian refiner HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd purchased India’s first-ever cargo from Guyana this month but the talks have taken place on a government-to-government basis.

“India is interested in taking Guyana’s share of its crude based on mutual agreements as part of its crude source diversification across the world” said one source with knowledge of the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The two parties are still negotiating pricing said the person adding that the crude would be processed by state-owned refineries in India.

Bharrat said pricing was the “most important” factor for Guyana in any potential deal.

“First and foremost is us getting the best price for our crude” he told Reuters in a telephone interview.",,,

Globe said its Managed WiFi and SD-WAN Connect+ solutions which are supported by Aruba are designed to help businesses deploy simplified and streamlined network infrastructure while reducing the burden of IT network management complexities and support costs.

MANILA Philippines — Globe Telecom Inc. has rolled out through its various units its new software-defined networking in a wide area network (SD-WAN) technology service in partnership with Aruba a Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) company.

Globe said its Managed WiFi and SD-WAN Connect+ solutions which are supported by Aruba are designed to help businesses deploy simplified and streamlined network infrastructure while reducing the burden of IT network management complexities and support costs.

The telco said these solutions enable IT decision makers to focus their attention more on developing strategies that are aligned with their business priorities.

“We are always looking for more efficient ways to help companies grow and create long-term resilience by implementing technology solutions that are agile easy to adopt and can drive increased outcomes” Globe president and CEO Ernest Cu said.

“By leveraging Aruba’s ecosystem of partner offerings we hope to deliver even more value to businesses and organizations that are on the path to digital transformation” Cu said.

Globe’s Managed WiFi affords organizations an enterprise-class WiFi facility without having to worry about complexities in design implementation and maintenance.

SD-WAN Connect+ on the other hand delivers an end-to-end solution that simplifies branch operations and optimizes wide area network management enabling increased visibility and control for organizations.

“Together with Globe we deliver flexible highly reliable and secure enterprise network solutions that improve network efficiency and optimize user experiences for clients customers and employees in the Philippines. By harnessing the power of agile cloud-based technology we introduce simplicity into a complex IT network management process” said Justin Chiah Aruba senior director South East Asia Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Globe has earlier signed a memorandum of understanding with HPE for a multi-access edge computing solution trial using 5G.

Globe has deployed HPE’s new Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) solution at its Edge Incubation Lab and is now offering select customers value-added edge services such as AI-powered video analytics industrial automation cloud gaming and virtual reality retail services.

Once the trial comes to a conclusion Globe plans to roll out its edge services at scale through its growing 5G network.

“We aim to provide our customers with the best possible experience at the edge and in the cloud across both 5G and fixed-line networks” Globe Business senior vice president Peter Maquera said.

“HPE has been a trusted technology provider to our infrastructure for many years so we are delighted to have them as one of our partners in building our innovative edge services portfolio. HPE’s solution is working well in the Globe Telcom Lab and has been designed to be deployed rapidly and at-scale across our growing 5G network” he said.

HPE’s MEC solution provides telcos with an end-to-end edge application management platform that can be configured across a multi-vendor and multi-cloud environment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvdWxkLWNvdmlkLWV4b2R1cy1zcGVlZC1oZWFydGxhbmQtMDkxMDUwNDgzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could COVID Exodus Speed the Heartland Revival?,"Over the past two decades America’s largest urban areas enjoyed a heady renaissance driven in large part by the in-migration of immigrants minorities and young people. But even as a big-city dominated press corps continued to report on gentrification and displacement those trends began to reverse themselves in recent years as all three of those populations started heading in ever larger numbers to suburbs sprawling sunbelt boomtowns and smaller cities and out of the biggest ones.

That shift preceded the COVID pandemic but has rapidly accelerated with the expansion of remote work which has undermined the economic basis for high-end urban and post-industrial economies. Meanwhile the severe lockdowns Democratic governors and mayors favored devastated the service and small business economies that had provided sustenance to immigrant and minority entrepreneurs and workers.

Trust the Science: The Blue State Surge Is Real

The same “canaries in the coal mine” that spurred America’s urban renaissance have been leaving its big cities in growing numbers since 2014 notes demographer Wendell Cox. New York Los Angeles and Chicago have all begun to lose population while people have flocked to new employment hubs like Austin Dallas Phoenix Columbus and Nashville that have led the way in terms of both overall new jobs and high-end business and professional service jobs.

Nowhere is this shift more evident than with immigrants. The share of the foreign born settling in big coastal “gateways” has plunged from 44 percent in 2010 to barely 35 percent in 2019. Foreign-born populations notes Cox in research for the think tank Heartland Forward stagnated or even declined in New York Los Angeles and Chicago as they surged in Houston (over 25 percent growth) Dallas-Ft Worth (30 percent) Charlotte (nearly 40 percent) and Nashville (a remarkable 44 percent).

Houston in fact is now the most diverse major metropolitan area in the country. In 1960 Harris County which includes Houston and many of its suburbs was 70 percent white non-Hispanic and 20 percent African American. Today the county's total population is 31 percent white and non-Hispanic 42 percent Hispanic 19 percent Black and 8 percent Asian. The share of foreign-born Houstonians now approaches one-fourth of the population—almost twice the average for the nation’s 50 most populous metros.

More surprising still has been the equally rapid move of immigrants to smaller cities such as Fayetteville Ark. Knoxville Tenn; Cedar Rapids Iowa Springfield Mo. and Fargo N.D. The fastest growth in foreign-born populations has been in areas with traditionally low immigrant concentrations. Where the foreign-born population grew by 10 percent nationally in the last decades in states like Georgia Kentucky South Carolina and the Dakotas it has expanded by 30 percent.

Racial minorities too are heading increasingly to the sunbelt boom towns the south and to smaller cities. The surges in Latino Asian and African American growth are not in Los Angeles New York Chicago or the Bay Area according to an analysis by Wendell Cox for the Urban Reform Institute but in Atlanta Boise Salt Lake City Phoenix and Las Vegas.

Again economics is a key factor. Middle-class job creation has been generally stronger in these communities and due to less regulation and lower taxes costs are lower. African-American real incomes in Atlanta are more than $60000 compared to $36000 in San Francisco and $37000 in Los Angeles. The median income for Latinos in Virginia Beach-Norfolk is $69000 compared to $43000 in Los Angeles $47000 in San Francisco and $40000 in New York City. The highest Asian median household incomes are in Raleigh Jackson Fayetteville (AR-MO) and Austin.

The ability to buy homes seems to be playing a big factor in where people choose to live. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans and home owners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters according to the Census Bureau. And home ownership notes Cox is in reach of many more people in the south and parts of the Midwest than it is in the ultra expensive markets in the Northeast and the West Coast.

And the young too are leaving for more affordable regions again in a trend that began before but was accelerated by the pandemic and the shift to online work. Over the last decade metropolitan areas like Nashville Austin Detroit San Antonio Grand Rapids and Dallas-Fort Worth have gained populations aged 25 to 34 while their numbers have been declining notes Brookings in coastal “magnets” such as New York Los Angeles and the Bay Area. According to an analysis of Census data by Smart Asset New York City lost a net of almost 40000 millennials in 2019 and Chicago lost more than 11000. Los Angeles San Diego Boston and Miami were also big net population losers.

These changes are impacting the growth of tech which many have seen as key to urban growth. Housing shortages in the San Francisco Bay Area and other high-demand locations become a significant barrier to innovation and economic growth and spurred greater inequality levels. In 2019 according to one survey two in five tech workers in the Bay Area were considering a move elsewhere.

COVID has accelerated this trend too as major tech firms including Oracle Hewlett Packard Enterprise McAfee Tesla and Dropbox have moved all or part of their key operations from the Bay Area to sprawling sunbelt suburbs. The largest gains in tech workers last year according to a study by Big Technology went to places like Madison Wisconsin while leaving the Bay Area. Even the countryside may be poised for a demographic comeback; between 2018 and 2020 the percentage of millennials who said they want to live in rural areas shot up from 29 to 39 percent.

The Virus Reopened America’s Wounds—and Poured Salt in Them

Do big cities have a future? Great and exciting places like New York will continue to attract educated young people at least before they start families. These places will likely retain both the poor who have few options to leave and the rich who can buy their way out of the worst aspects of urban life by living in secure buildings sending kids to private schools and absconding to second or third homes elsewhere.

But for cities to come all the way back greater emphasis needs to be placed on making core cities more livable healthier safer and friendly to grassroots businesses. One partial solution would mean dispersing the economy to where people live; for example allowing more work to be done in Brooklyn Queens and other outlying areas than forcing people to commute into Manhattan.

What matters most now for cities more than anything is the realization that the world is changing and was doing so before COVID. A return to the high-growth and high-density economy seems unlikely in the near or mid-term but an improved city cleaner and more human scaled could emerge ushering in not a bigger grandiose urban future but a more human one.

LAKELAND Fla. - 329 E. Main LLC owners of the historic hotel at 329 East Main Street Lakeland Fla. announced the Terrace Hotel Lakeland will join Tapestry Collection by Hilton in April 2021. The property conversion consists of new branding as well as renovations to guest rooms public spaces and on-site fine dining restaurant The Terrace Grille. The 88-room hotel will be operated by Naples Hotel Group with construction led by Pinkerton & Laws and interior design by Sims Patrick Studio. The property is currently welcoming guests.

“The entire ownership team is happy to see through the completion of Edie and David Henderson’s vision for the remodel of this grand historic hotel. We are proud to reinvigorate one of Lakeland’s historic downtown destinations for the community to experience” said Todd Baylis manager 329 East Main LLC. “We are excited to partner with Hilton and the Tapestry Collection brand to bring a fresh and upscale lodging option to the City of Lakeland.”

The hotel opened its doors in 1924 as Lakeland's first grand hotel and high-rise building and Florida’s first year-round hotel due to the invention of air conditioning.

Marriott declared that their hotels shouldn’t be used to temporarily house people picked up in immigration raids.

So you would be forgiven for thinking that Hilton hotels were no longer being used to detain migrants. Yet there’s another political furor over hotels housing migrant families and a Hampton Inn by Hilton has just backed out of a contract to do so along with a Microtel (Wyndham) and a Best Western.

Three hotels under the Endeavors contract started housing migrant families earlier this month. The accommodations are expected to hold roughly 600 migrants altogether. A Woodspring Suites a Hampton Inn by Hilton a Microtel by Wyndham and a Best Western were slated to open up more space for migrant families starting April 30 but backed out and now the deadline has been pushed back according to sources familiar with the situation. Endeavors told Axios that it has been able to secure three alternative hotel sites but did not provide further details.

The company contracting with these hotels “hired a Biden transition official shortly before the non-bid contracts were signed” for $87 million.

Of course when the Ritz-Carlton Riyadh was used as a detention center (and reportedly for torture and murder) Marriott didn’t deflag the property. So I’m not sure how consistent the outrage is or how willing a chain is to lose business over their convictions.

Three years ago it was airlines objecting to being used by the federal government to deport kids though Delta ‘applauded the administration’ for its efforts to unite immigrant children with their parents (sic).

The brand’s new Prototype 10.0 includes a smaller footprint but with more rooms as well as changes to guest suites and common spaces.

The new prototype draws from design ideas implemented during a 2019 update implemented in open Homewood Suites hotels as part of the brand’s 30-year anniversary. Prototype 10.0 features a site size reduction from 2.49 acres to 2.36 acres and building area reduction by more than 3350 square feet while increasing the number of rooms from 121 to 131 suites. Another developer-oriented change is new F&B options aimed at increasing revenue.

The suites have been modified so they can be booked individually or as connected groups. The fitness center has been reimagined and guest laundry rooms have been expanded. More common areas have been added inside and outside in the prototype.

“We modernized the brand to appeal to the evolving needs of our guests who are going to love the functionality and flexibility of the innovations which are intended to make them feel both empowered and cared for whether they’re with us for an overnight trip or an extended stay” said Rick Colling global head of Homewood Suites.

Prototype 10.0 is expected to be in market in 2023 and includes input from owners. Later this year Homewood Suites will undergo an updated brand identity including a new logo and the brand will release a renovation guide for existing hotel owners to provide guidance and direction on updating elements of their hotels.

In March Choice Hotels International’s flagship brand Comfort Inn announced its new Rise & Shine prototype. The first hotel under that prototype also is expected to open in 2023.

Azim Saju CEO and president of HDG was one of several owners consulted on the design.

“It’s not every day you can say that you directly influenced a brand’s new product but the Comfort prototype is a great example of how Choice Hotels’ collaboration with owners and developers ensures a win for everyone” Saju said. “I’m always looking for ways to optimize returns for my investments. I know Choice is too. I’m proud to have been a part of an incredible project that will be a game changer in the market of current and prospective owners as well as our guests.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY29udGluZ2VudG1hZ2F6aW5lLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L2NvbG9ueS1vZi1jb2JibGVzdG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colony of Cobblestone,"Every time I walk through Old San Juan I feel transported to Puerto Rico when it was a Spanish colony. It is warm and comforting to become immersed in the colorful buildings. The military forts surrounding Old San Juan however make me imagine the battles and trauma this area has experienced. And underneath my shoes are cobblestones that have a place in that history. The blue cobblestones (the slag turns blue over time from exposure) lining the streets tell a story about Puerto Rico’s colonial relationships with Spain and the United States.

Spain began colonizing Puerto Rico shortly after Christopher Columbus’s arrival there in 1493. At San Juan Spanish ships loaded gold sugar and other valuable materials extracted from the island. But first the ships offloaded stones they had carried across the Atlantic as ballast to make the empty vessels stable. Road builders used the leftover stones to create the cobblestones for the streets of San Juan. The builders used in other words debris left behind by Spain when it bore away Puerto Rico’s resources. Encapsulated in those cobblestones is the Spanish empire’s exploitation of the island.

These blue cobblestones also played a role in the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. During the Cold War the U.S. sought to modernize Puerto Rico’s economy as a bulwark against the spreading influence of communism in the Caribbean and Latin America. Part of this project was developing the island’s tourism industry with Old San Juan at the forefront. Plans to renovate Old San Juan which at that time was a slum with many abandoned and derelict buildings were proposed in 1951; construction began in 1955 under a government project called Operation Serenity. Although the property owners of Old San Juan had their homes renovated during this process those that benefited from this project the most were companies like Hilton Hotels & Resorts and Pan American Airways. The tourism industry used eminent domain to colonize the island and profit from it despite the persistent American belief that the United States freed Puerto Rico from the grasp of Spanish colonialism.

Hotel construction skyrocketed and images of a renovated Old San Juan were used in advertisements. Cobblestones contributed to the images that hotels tried to sell depicting Puerto Rico as a tropical paradise with “Old World charm.” The tourism industry wanted Old San Juan to make tourists feel like they were in a foreign country instead of a U.S. territory.

Renovating Old San Juan meant placing new cobblestones throughout the city. These cobblestones were supposed to add to Old San Juan’s European-style aesthetic. But the images of worn cobblestones are nonetheless illusions conjured as a result of U.S. rule. The cobblestones were made to look old despite being new.

Like the Caribbean sun guiding the clouds and rain to create rainbows in the sky the blue cobblestones of Old San Juan beneath my feet guide me through a rainbow of colorful buildings in my path. But when I reach the end of a street I see a slum and the picturesque colors are gone. Despite its great beauty Puerto Rico is not paradise; it is a real place with real people living in it not a postcard. The cracks on the blue cobblestones are a reminder that Puerto Rico remains the oldest colony in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wNC8yNS9oaWx0b24tdW52ZWlscy1ob21ld29vZC1zdWl0ZXMtcmVmcmVzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton unveils Homewood Suites refresh – Business Traveller,"Hilton has unveiled a brand refresh for its extended stay Homewood Suites brand.

The group said that the ‘Prototype 10.0’ had been designed “to offer added value and versatility for owners and developers while exceeding the needs of guests who want the comforts of home”.

Features include a new “King Efficiency” suite category representing up to 30 per cent of each hotel’s inventory and offering fully-equipped kitchens a work space area and soft seating. These suites can either be booked individually or as connecting suites for larger groups and families.

The brand’s fitness centres have been “reimagined” and the guest laundry areas have been doubled in size “to be more reflective of the experience of guests in their own homes”."

The pursuit resulted in a deadly shootout after Chadwell shot an officer in the shoulder prompting cops to fire multiple shots in return.

On Friday Chicago's Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) publicly released video and audio footage that captured the events leading up to Chadwell's death as well as the moment he opens fire on the officer.

In the wake of the shooting Chadwell's mother told CBS Chicago her son was not a 'bad person at all' and did not believe he intended to harm anyone.

The mom who did not wish to be named said her son was diagnosed with ADHD and had mental health problems.

'He was a beautiful child' she told the news outlet in an interview last month.

ENFIELD Conn. — A suspect who was at large after an incident back in March has been charged State Police said Friday.

35-year-old Scott Kaminski of East Hartford turned himself in Tuesday on a warrant issued after he evaded police who located him slumped over a steering wheel in the parking lot of a Home Depot.

Kaminski had allegedly used illicit narcotics and drove under the influence.

He has been charged with the following:

Reckless Endangerment

Interfering with an officer

Theft of Plates/ Inserts

Disobeying Signal of Officer

Engaging Police in Pursuit

Reckless Driving

Illegal Operation of Motor Vehicle under Suspension

Kiminski was released on a $10000 cash-surety bond and is expected to appear in court on July 20.

Officials say when the Trooper located Kaminski they donned identifiable clothing and his body-worn camera and placed his cruiser in front of the vehicle with lights activated. The off-duty Trooper observed a male asleep behind the wheel. The Trooper was able to wake the man who then rolled down his window. After identifying himself the trooper says he observed signs of illicit narcotic use and believed the operator was under the influence. The trooper asked the man to step out of the vehicle. Instead the operator placed his vehicle in reverse then negotiated around the trooper's cruiser and took off at a high rate of speed nearly striking the Trooper as well as several patrons exiting and entering the Home Depot.

There was just slight one problem though....

The couple - Courtney Wilson and Shenita Jones - didn’t own the 16300-square-foot estate nor did they have permission to use it but thought that owner wouldn’t be home at the time.

However they were sorely mistaken.

The mansion’s owner Nathan Finkel was understandably shocked when he saw the groom on the property getting ready for his big day and called 911 on Saturday morning.

Read more:

“They keep harassing me calling me” Finkel told a dispatcher.

“They say they’re having a wedding here and it’s God’s message. I don’t know what’s going on. All I want is (for) it to stop. And they’re sitting at my property right at the front gate right now.”

Wilson left the property when the police eventually arrived and no charges were filed.

It seems that Wilson had a divine calling when it came to choosing his wedding venue and “said it was God’s plan that [he and Jones] marry” at the mansion.

A look inside the Fort Lauderdale mansion.

Several months before Wilson toured the estate posing as a potential buyer said Keith Poliakoff attorney for Southwest Ranches the suburb where Finkel lives.

“A few months later this guy asked Nathan if he could use Nathan’s backyard for his wedding” Poliakoff said. “Nathan said no.”

A copy of the wedding invitation shown in a Boing Boing post describes where to find the bride and groom’s “dream home and Estate” and that guests were in for “a wonderful evening of celebration exquisite feast and dancing at our Royal Extravaganza!!”

“The guy figured it was a vacant house and didn’t realize Nathan lived on the property in a different home” Poliakoff said.

“This guy had no idea he lived there. You know the shock that must have been on his face when he showed up at the gate and the owner was home?”

The Saturday afternoon ceremony would be followed by a red carpet cocktail hour and a reception lasting past midnight. Then Sunday brunch would last from noon to 4 pm.

Sounds like they had it all figured out apart from one important detail..."
HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmF5cy8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L3JheXMtc2VuZC1kb3duLWJyZW50LWhvbmV5d2VsbC1hcy1idWxscGVuLXNodWZmbGUtY29udGludWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rays send down Brent Honeywell as bullpen shuffle continues,"ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays continue to shuffle their bullpen.

By the end of the night Saturday Brent Honeywell was down and Chris Mazza out of action placed on the injured list with shoulder inflammation.

But Diego Castillo was back from his one-day stay on the COVID-19 injured list due to side effects from the vaccine and Luis Patino was set to be activated Sunday in somewhat of a multi-inning opener role.

Got all that?

Honeywell was the opener Saturday working on three days’ rest and needing 30 pitches to get through his first and only inning. He allowed a three-run homer to Randal Grichuk after first baseman Yandy Diaz failed to catch a foul pop that would have been the third out.

“Brent was fine” manager Kevin Cash said. “He was frustrated but he’ll be fine.”

Mazza threw in Friday’s game — and threw well holding the Jays to one hit over three innings on 34 pitches — but said afterward his shoulder “was barking a little bit” according to Cash. “There’s some inflammation in there that probably we need to kind of let calm down see where it goes over the next 10-15 days. Shut him down for right now and hopefully he bounces back. It’s just another injury that we work hard to avoid but they keep creeping up on us a little bit.”

Mazza’s injury comes after he was sent down Thursday called back up Friday when Castillo was sidelined and was potentially headed back down as Castillo returned Saturday.

Castillo said he was much better Saturday after dealing with multiple issues Friday after getting his second shot in his left arm on Thursday. “It’s exactly what everyone else is feeling” he said via team interpreter Manny Navarro. “I felt tired and sore and then kind of feverish.”

To reinstate Castillo the Rays needed space on the 40-man roster as they had added reliever Louis Head on Friday. Catcher Deivy Grullon claimed from the Reds on April 6 was designated for assignment.

Also pitcher Chris Archer’s return from mid-April elbow tightness has been delayed in part because he has been away from the team dealing with a family matter though he continues to work out.

What goes up

There was one of those Tropicana Field moments in the top of the second. Cavan Biggio popped up a ball over home that several Rays tracked and pitcher Ryan Yarbrough tried unsuccessfully to catch. The Rays said the ball hit something to change direction. The umps clearly weren’t sure huddling three different times looking up a lot consulting with both managers looking up some more.

They finally decided the ball did strike something — a cable between the A and B rings — in foul territory and thus was a dead ball sending Biggio back to the plate. He made it somewhat of a moot point by slapping a single to left. “I don’t know” Yarbrough said. “It was one of those weird things.”

Music producer tech entrepreneur and philanthropist will.i.am in partnership with pioneering manufacturing and technology leader Honeywell has introduced XUPERMASK where the common face mask takes on a smarter more stylish persona. The tech imbued XUPERMASK owes its edge to its myriad built-in functions such as a microphone and noise-cancelling Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds that clip magnetically onto the mask when not in use apart from its main purpose of reducing the spread of the coronavirus contagion. Let’s get it started shall we?

Best known for being the frontman and co-founder of American music group Black Eyed Peas will.i.am also partnered with Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez who has created iconic costumes such as Thanos’ makeup and helmet in the Avengers multiverse and the gold and silver helmets for famous French electronic music duo Daft Punk.

The multifaceted product design creates a new category of its own among the N-95’s surgical and luxury ones. According to the XUPERMASK team the mask equips its wearer for the “mid and post-pandemic world via wearable technology created ergonomically to fit and enhanced with multiple functions for the modern lifestyle”.

At a time when face masks have become a necessity in our wardrobe will.i.am shares that he created this tech integrated one to change the game of the new normal embrace its function but make it fashion. “In this new age of style and security XUPERMASK is uncompromising protection with high-tech performance for the modern lifestyle. Alongside Honeywell we have engineered the accessory with state-of-the-art breathing filtration” says the Grammy Award-winning musician.

The most common issue encountered while wearing surgical masks was of glasses fogging up (will.i.am has got your back fellow spectacle wearers) as well as earphones getting in the way or muffled voices over a phone call or the massive amounts of plastic pollution because of discarded masks.

Yet humans lived without such things no more than 10 15 years ago and one never knows when those times may be back on account of whatever disaster poor area coverage or enemy jamming.

As civilians we are now literally dependent on GPS but military forces are even more so. This is why for them the prospect of having to work without global positioning aids must be even more daunting. And this is also why armed forces are also training to operate without them.A possible tool to aid them with this might be Honeywell’s recently-announced “lineup of alternative navigation solutions” that need no GPS to work.This lineup includes several technologies all meant to provide the troops using them with information about positioning speed and heading. Honeywell spilled some limited beans on three of them in mid-April.The first is called Vision-Aided Navigation and relies on a live optical or infra-red camera feed and stored maps. Using the images it gets from the camera and comparing them with the existing maps the system allows for “GPS-like accuracy in GPS-denied or jammed conditions.”The fancy-called Celestial-Aided Navigation is next bringing to the table a system that literally observes the stars and other reference objects such as satellites with known positions and speeds and then it is capable of determining the user’s position and speed.Last but not least comes the Magnetic Anomaly-Aided Navigation a tool that measures magnetic strength and compares the results with “known geographical magnetic maps.” The results is info about the user’s position.Honeywell says prototypes of these tools will become available next year with actual deliveries expected to begin in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwMzg5MDYzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Patricia Ann 'Patsy' Vessey,"Vessey Patricia Ann ""Patsy"" Born April 16 1929 died peacefully on April 19 2021 in Minneapolis at the age of 92.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

As is so often the case with new hypercars from little-known companies however the Quasar doesn’t exist yet.

Elektron claims that its Quasar hypercar will feature four electric motors that combine to pump out an extraordinary 2300 hp giving it even more power than the likes of the Rimac C_Two Pininfarina Battista and Lotus Evija. As if the peak horsepower number wasn’t impressive enough the company asserts the car will tips the scales at just 3307 lbs (1500 kg).

No details have been provided about the vehicle’s battery pack but Elektron says it will be able to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) in as little as 1.65 seconds and max out at a limited top speed of 280 mph (450 km/h).

Images released of the Quasar reveal that its design has been heavily influenced by the Koenigsegg Jesko – which we guess is a good thing although we don’t know how it’ll sit with the Swedish automaker.

The front of the Quasar features angular headlights and includes a curved LED daytime running light running across the outer edge of the hood. The car also features carbon fiber canards and a pronounced carbon fiber splitter. Elsewhere the car has a curved windshield and roof design virtually identical to what all Koenigseggs have had for the past two decades.

The Ultima GTR technically falls into the kit car category but you'd have to be insane to even go near it with the intention of building it yourself unless you had previously taken out and put back together at least one Formula One car if not several.What makes it so special is a combination of power lightness and absolutely no crash protection. ""If you crash you're dead"" admits Shaun the owner. Since your feet are literally inches away from the front axle and there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact YOU become the crumple zone. Realizing that makes watching the rest of the clip quite an anxious affair but since the video is up on YouTube it means everything went smoothly until the end.Shaun looks just like you would expect to for the owner of such a car: like a complete madman. Obviously he's quite nice and affable which is where his traits start to diverge from those of his vehicle. The Ultima GTR's looks match its nature perfectly. This car is as raw and visceral as its low-slung silhouette and straight-forward approach would suggest.The chassis is designed by Lee Noble the man who then went on to establish Noble Automotive  the company behind several other somewhat similar cars. The GTR used to have a 350 Chevy V8 but the previous owner found it to be too ""agricultural"" so he had it swapped for a German 4.2-liter V8 taken from an Audi RS6. In this configuration the Ultima develops 550 hp all sent to the fat rear wheels through a Porsche transaxle.The specs might not sound awfully impressive but they get a whole new dimension when you hear what this thing weighs. Thanks to its compact dimensions and fiberglass body the Ultima GTR only tilts the scales as far as 2100 lbs (950 kg) for a power-to-weight ratio of 560 hp/ton. That's definitely supercar territory even if the cabin amenities point more toward a golf cart.Luxury and comfort are two words that were nowhere to be found on Ultima GTR's brief though. Uncompromised driving experience on the other hand was probably the title and the end product definitely delivered. Watch Shaun the owner and Jamie the channel host giggle like two schoolboys at the experience. And anyone who's ever been in one of these flawed but so full of character British sports cars (or even supercars in this case) will understand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdGhlLXRveW90YS1jb3JvbGxhLWdybW4taG90LWhhdGNoLXN0YWNrcy11cC1hZ2FpbnN0LXRoZS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How The Toyota Corolla GRMN Hot Hatch Stacks Up Against The Competition,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdGhlLXRveW90YS1jb3JvbGxhLWdybW4taG90LWhhdGNoLXN0YWNrcy11cC1hZ2FpbnN0LXRoZS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The Canadian duo will be vying for a seventh title together in their 12th World Tour final when they face Talita Antunes and Taiana Lima of Brazil on Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET in Cancun Mexico.

They defeated Germany's Chantal Laboureur and Cinja Tillmann in Monday's semifinal by scores of 21-16 and 21-14 after prevailing two sets to one in an earlier matchup in pool play.

""Having a couple of days under our belts to play in these [hot and windy conditions] we really narrowed down our game"" Humana-Paredes said in a story on the tournament website. ""I think our serving has gotten them in trouble and Sarah's blocking was phenomenal. They're a really strong ball-control team and we knew we had to put pressure on them from the baseline which we did.

""It's really good for our confidence that we're in the final again. We still have a lot of things that we want to improve on and it's very promising that we're getting to finals and there's still another level that we can bring.""

Antunes and Lima like Pavan and Humana-Paredes advanced to the final with five consecutive victories. The Brazilians beat compatriots Agatha Bednarczuk and Eduarda 'Duda' Lisboa 21-14 10-21 15-13 in the semifinals.

Antunes and Lima have won five of the eight finals they have played together over two stints as partners between 2013-2014 and in 2019. They are playing together in the Cancun Hub tournaments because Maria Elisa Antonelli Antunes' regular playing partner is home building up her fitness after giving birth to her first son last year.

Antunes' most recent match against Pavan and Humana-Paredes was in 2017.

""They [have] improved so much since then"" she said. ""It will be a difficult match but as long as we keep playing with the same energy and the same union I think we have what it takes to win.""

On March 12 the Canadians won silver at the Katara Beach World Cup in Doha Qatar their first major international competition in 19 months. On their way to the podium Pavan and Humana-Paredes fought back from a first-set loss to fellow Canadians Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson to win 21-18 and 15-9.

In Monday's quarter-finals at the Playa Delfines Pavan and Humana-Paredes swept Bansley and Wilkerson 2-0 (21-12 22-20).

Pavan and Humana-Paredes the FIVB world ranking leaders improved to 7-2 in the head-to-head matchup and plan to compete in at least four more tournaments over the next two months.

After a first-set loss in the quarter-finals it was Bansley and Wilkerson's turn at being resilient after falling behind 12-4 in the second set when the former hit the ball into the net.

Bansley then stepped up her service game and they closed to within a point at 15-14 and later 18-17 before a Bansley ace tied the set 19-19. After Pavan and Humana-Paredes went up 20-19 on a handling call to Bansley she evened matters with a kill.

6th in provisional Olympic rankings

Pavan and Humana-Paredes took the match following a missed serve by Wilkerson and Humana-Paredes ace with the ball landing on the line.

Bansley and Wilkerson jumped out to a 2-0 advantage in the opening set but never held the lead again after Pavan made it 2-2 with an ace.

Leading 13-8 Pavan and Humana-Paredes scored six of the next eight points with Pavan sending a kill deep inside the back line to make it 19-10 on the way to victory.

Bansley and Wilkerson who placed ninth in Doha are sixth in the provisional Olympic rankings and likely will qualify.

The plan is to return to Rio de Janeiro Brazil where they have trained for several months or perhaps head to Hermosa Beach Calif. where several top American teams and other federations are training.

The Navy on Saturday christened the latest Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer headed for homeport in San Diego.

The future USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee honors the barrier-breaking woman who served as the second Superintendent of the Navy Nurse Corps and was the first living woman to receive the Navy Cross in honor of her service in World War I.

“The future USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee will serve for decades as a reminder of Ms. Higbee’s service to our nation and her unwavering support of a strong and healthy Navy and Marine Corps team” said Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Harker.

“This ship honors not only her service but that of all of our Navy nurses who support the strength and wellbeing of our service members and their families” he said.

Former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus gave the address during the traditional ceremony at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard on the Mississippi coast.

The 73rd Arleigh Burke-class destroyer will be 509.5 feet long and 59 feet wide with a displacement of 9496 tons.

The warship will be armed with the sophisticated Aegis radar and fire-control system 96 guided missiles in vertical launch tubes a 5-inch gun a Phalanx rapid-fire anti-aircraft gun and two helicopters.

The ship is the second to honor Higbee. The first a World War II-era destroyer that also saw action in the Vietnam War was the first warship named for a female member of the Navy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

OpenBuilt is designed with the goal to allow companies across the construction industry architects building material suppliers manufacturers and engineering firms to connect their technology platforms to partners and suppliers in their supply chain relying on a common cloud platform and infrastructure. Using OpenBuilt construction companies will then have access to different applications and services from technology providers.

OpenBuilt currently plans three major components: Automate a low code development platform to automate business processes Exchange a hub to connect manufacturers and customers and Products an application for creating and publishing product information. According to the OpenBuilt team:

Automate will enable businesses to connect disparate software and define rules on how the data is exchanged and manipulated so that manual effort is eliminated. It provides that glue to bind these systems together and because it is quick and easy to set up it can also be easily updated and re-deployed. (...) Exchange will connect manufacturers and customers providing a central hub where specifying a complex wall system will be almost as easy as booking a hotel.

The development will focus on three main areas: building OpenBuilt on top of the container application OpenShift integrating existing solutions like IBM's Watson Maximo TRIRIGA KITT dictionary IBM Blockchain and Salesforce open APIs and developing new applications to search filter and sort building product technical data. Paul Surin global lead built environment at IBM comments:

The built environment is a vibrant industry of diverse sectors disciplines and business sizes. OpenBuilt Automate will enable businesses to connect disparate software and define rules on how the data is exchanged eliminating manual efforts. It provides the means to bind these systems together and because it is quick and easy to set up it can also be easily updated and re-deployed. You won’t have to be a software developer to begin building applications that can automate your business processes.

In the Q&A ""Construction is notoriously expensive. Can cloud platforms build a better future?"" Mark Farmer founding director & CEO at Cast explains how an open platform can help:

Cloud platforms that enable people to collaborate in an open-source manner such as OpenBuilt could take the edge off the culture of opaqueness by enabling people to build interconnected ecosystems. It could build more trust in how we do construction and commercially contract.

OpenBuilt’s founding members include companies from the built environment like Cemex EDIN Network Backe Sol Services and Element.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi12aWxsYWdlLmNvbS9ob25kYS1pcy1sb29raW5nLXRvLW1ha2UtYS1zaGlmdC1mcm9tLWdhcy1jYXJzLXRvLXNlbGxpbmctZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtYnktMjA0MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honda is looking to make a shift from Gas cars to selling Electric vehicles by 2040,,,,,,,,,,

But this time around instead of focusing on the most powerful x86 single board computers which would lead to unaffordable industrial Xeon SBC’s we’ll be looking into the 5 best boards designed for makers. That means affordable pricing I/O headers and community support. The list is in no particular order.

Rock Pi X – x86 on the cheap

If you ever wanted the cheapest possible x86 board Atomic Pi SBC $35 price tag was hard to beat but it was only cheap because it was sourced from a failed robotics project and not very convenient to use. But now in 2021 the cheapest x86 SBC that can run Windows is clearly Rock Pi X starting at $39…

That price tag is for the version with 1 GB RAM and 8GB eMMC flash and AFAIK it is impossible to source with the most common model being Rock Pi X with 2GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash sold for $63 plus shipping.

While Rock Pi X SBC can run Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04 our review of Rock Pi X with both operating systems showed it could be challenging to have everything work well with some driver issues (as of January 2021) and thermal cooling not implemented by default (so remember to purchase the optional heatsink). Of course you should not expect greater performance from a Cherry Trail processor. Rock Pi X is mostly interesting for its compact form factor low price and x86 compatibility.

Technically speaking there’s another x86 SBC that’s even cheaper but not using Intel nor AMD and instead 86duino Zero relies on a DM&P Vortex86EX 32-bit single-core processor @ 300 MHz with 128MB of RAM…

ODYSSEY-X86J4125 – Intel meets Arduino & Raspberry Pi

GPIO headers are important to makers to connect sensors control servos and motors and so on. Seeed Studio ODYSSEY-X86J4105 single board computer now supplanted by ODYSSEY-X86J4125 combines the power of an Intel Gemini Lake (Refresh) processor with the real-time ability of a Microchip SAMD21 Cortex-M0+ Arduino compatible microcontroller and on top of that a Raspberry Pi header is also available for even more expansion options.

We tested the board with Windows 10 Enterprise and Ubuntu 20.04 and everything worked as expected but the fan can be a little noisy and the Raspberry Pi header was only supported in Ubuntu. Documentation can be found in the Wiki.

While it should be hard to source the ODYSSEY-X86J4105 SBC as the processor is phased out the new ODYSSEY-X86J4125 SBC with a faster processor and the same features is sold for $218 without storage or $269 with a 128 GB eMMC flash and Re_Computer case.

UP Single Board Computer Family – Cherry Trail to Tiger Lake

I’m going to start to cheat a little here as it is supposed to be a list of 5 single board computers I’ll just a family of boards from AAEON here namely the “UP the bridge family” that ranges from the Raspberry Pi-sized UP board initially introduced in 2015 with a Cherry Trail processor to the mid-range UP Squared series for AI & IoT applications with more expansion capabilities and the higher-end UP Xtreme if even more powerful yet low power processor culminating with the UP Xtreme i11 Tiger Lake SBC.

IMHO that is what makes AAEON UP boards interesting is that you can use the same set of tools and software and a wide family range and then opt to upgrade or downgrade the board to match your requirements. The company also offers the Pro series of the aforementioned families for industrial automation and AI solutions and well as complete reference designs.

You’ll find documentation and support forums on the official website and UP boards can be purchased from UP Shop with prices starting at $109 and up to $999.

ODROID-H2+ – Affordable 2.5GbE networking

If you want a relatively low-cost Intel SBC with fast 2.5GbE networking the obvious choice is Hardkernel ODROID-H2+ single board computer equipped with two 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports or even a total of 6 2.5GbE ports with an expansion board. Based on an Intel Celeron J4115 processor coupled with 2 or 4GB RAM the board is an updated version of ODROID-H2 which we reviewed with Ubuntu 19.04 and powered by an Intel Celeron J4105.

Hardkernel is known for its great community and good support for all their boards as well as affordable pricing. When there is stock ODROID-H2+ can be purchased for $119 on Hardkernel but due to the shipping costs it may be cheaper on distributors such as Ameridroid where you could use the coupon code CNXSUPP6 to get a $6 discount.

UDOO Bolt – AMD SBC’s for makers

So far we’ve only listed single board computers with Intel processors but UDOO offers an interesting AMD Ryzen Embedded SBC with UDOO Bolt. The board is offered in two variants with UDOO Bolt V3 equipped with V1202B dual-core/quad-thread processor and UDOO Bolt V8 with a more powerful V1605B quad-core/octa-thread processor.

UDOO Bolt comes with two SO-DIMM slots for up to 64GB RAM 32 GB eMMC flash M.2 & SATA connectors for storage support for up to four 4K displays via HDMI 2.0 and USB-C ports Gigabit Ethernet and more. There’s also a Microchip ATmega32u4 AVR microcontroller as found in Arduino Leonardo to control various I/Os with Arduino code.

The company provides pretty good documentation and support through a forum. UDOO Bolt V3 & V8 can be purchased directly on UDOO shop for $365 and $459 respectively. If you’d rather get a case with your SBC the company sells UDOO Bolt Gear mini PC based on UDOO Bolt V8.

That’s it for the list. Do you have another x86 SBC designed for makers that could/should have made the list? If so let us know in the comments.

But there's no sign of them in the U.S. yet.

Most performance enthusiasts are eager to get Intel's unlocked K-series processors with a 95W – 125W TDP that can boost their clocks sky-high and support all the latest technologies. But there are also enthusiasts who prefer small form-factor low-power builds but would still like to have CPUs with eight or ten cores and all the latest technologies. Intel typically addresses these users with its T-series processors featuring a 35W TDP but sometimes these chips are hard to get.

Intel formally introduced its low-power eight-core Core i9-11900T and Core i7-11700T 'Rocket Lake' CPUs with a 35W TDP along with their high-performance i9-11900K and i7-11700K brethren on March 30 2021. But unlike the 'unlocked and unleashed' K-series processors the new T-series products were not immediately available at launch. Fortunately the situation is starting to change.

Akiba PC Hotline and Hermitage Akihabara report that the new 35W Core i9-11900T and Core i7-11700T CPUs in bulk and boxed versions are readily available in at least four stores in Tokyo Japan. The higher-end i9-11900T model is sold for ¥60478 – ¥62700 with VAT whereas the i7-11700T SKU is priced at ¥45078 – ¥47300 including tax.

Geizhals.EU a price search engine in Europe finds that Intel's Core i9-11900T is available in dozens of stores in Austria Germany and Poland starting at €455 with VAT ($462 without taxes). Meanwhile there are no offers for the cheaper Core i7-11700T at this point.

But at the moment the new Rocket Lake-T CPUs are not currently available in the U.S. at Amazon and Newegg. In fact the stores are not even taking pre-orders on these parts. The situation has already prompted enthusiasts of low-power SFF builds to start a thread at Reddit to monitor their availability.

Intel's latest Core i9-11900T and Core i7-11700T processors indeed look quite attractive. The CPUs feature eight cores with Hyper-Threading 16MB of cache a modern Xe-based integrated GPU and support up to 128GB of memory. Intel's i9-11900T and i7-11700T CPUs feature relatively low base frequencies of 2.00 GHz and 1.50 GHz (respectively) but rather high all-core boost clocks of 3.60 GHz and 3.70 GHz (respectively). When installed into compatible motherboards they can hit high frequencies and pretty much guarantee great system responsiveness and decent performance in mainstream applications (assuming adequate cooling). So while these are definitely niche chips it's not surprising that demand for these CPUs is fairly high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS93YXJ6b25lLWFkbGVyLWludGVsLWd1aWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warzone: How To Find All Adler Intel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS93YXJ6b25lLWFkbGVyLWludGVsLWd1aWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVjb3JkLm1lZGlhL21pY3Jvc29mdC10by1sZXZlcmFnZS1pbnRlbC1jcHVzLXRvLWRldGVjdC1jcnlwdG8tbWluaW5nLW1hbHdhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft to leverage Intel CPUs to detect crypto-mining malware,"Microsoft said today that it is rolling out an update to the commercial version of the Defender antivirus that will now be capable of using a little-known Intel CPU security feature to detect crypto-mining malware at the processor level.

The technology known as Intel TDT (Threat Detection Technology) works by exposing CPU heuristics and telemetry to security software so the data can be analyzed using machine learning for malicious code that evaded antivirus engines at the operating system level.

Microsoft explains:

This technology [the TDT] is based on telemetry signals coming directly from the PMU the unit that records low-level information about performance and microarchitectural execution characteristics of instructions processed by the CPU. Coin miners make heavy use of repeated mathematical operations and this activity is recorded by the PMU which triggers a signal when a certain usage threshold is reached. The signal is processed by a layer of machine learning which can recognize the footprint generated by the specific activity of coin mining. Since the signal comes exclusively from the utilization of the CPU caused by execution characteristics of malware it is unaffected by common antimalware evasion techniques such as binary obfuscation or memory-only payloads.

This is the third known case where Intel TDT is deployed in a real-world security product.

TDT was used for the first time in 2018 by Microsoft and Cisco to accelerate memory scans for their Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (now rebranded as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) and Tetration platforms respectively.

Earlier this year Boston-based security firm Cybereason used TDT to create a ransomware detection module for its antivirus engine. This module worked similarly to Microsoft's new crypto-mining detection feature—by tapping into the TDT data stream to detect ransomware-specific operations at the CPU level.

Because of its unique insight and ability to work at the CPU level rather than the OS level Intel TDT is expected to see broader adoption in the future.

This is especially relevant as more and more malware creators are adding antivirus evasion code to their malware and as some cybercrime groups are realizing they could evade antivirus detection by hiding malware inside virtual machines. While a virtual machine may be able to hide malicious code from its parent OS it can't hide it from the CPU.

Furthermore the time is also right for a broader TDT adoption. While the technology has been around for years it took some time before CPUs made it into users' hands.

Intel said today that there are nearly a billion Intel TDT-capable PCs in the market; CPUs where security vendors can now tap into TDT to deploy next-level detection capabilities.

Currently TDT is included with Intel Core processors and with any Intel CPU series that supports Intel vPro a collection of enterprise-centered technologies.

Unfortunately the new crypto-mining detection capabilities are not supported on the free version of the Defender antivirus which ships with all Windows 10 operating systems.

It is only supported on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint which is the paid version of Defender comes with extra features and is only sold to enterprise customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2NhbGwtZHV0eS1ibGFjay1vcHMtY29sZC13YXItem9tYmllcy1zZWFzb24tMy1pbnRlbC1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Zombies - Season 3 Intel Guide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2NhbGwtZHV0eS1ibGFjay1vcHMtY29sZC13YXItem9tYmllcy1zZWFzb24tMy1pbnRlbC1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Story continues

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

No I'm not talking about how to win at the game though there is plenty of research and guidance both academic and popular on that should you be looking for it. I'm talking about the cadence of each round itself: When do you throw your sign? Do you throw on a count of three—""rock paper scissors""? Do you throw on four—""rock paper scissors shoot""? Or do you like me and millions of wise handsome people do what got me so mercilessly mocked by my co-workers this week and throw on a count of five—""rock papers scissors says shoot""?

All logical people agree on the value of RPS which has been used to settle everything from points of law to soccer kick-offs but there is widespread disagreement on the proper way to count off before throwing. This count-off is called ""priming"" with the throw being the ""delivery"" and oh buddy you'd better believe that it's taken seriously at the highest level. But informally there remains a great deal of variation in priming almost entirely geographic.

We at Defector learned a lot this week about each other. Everyone else learned that I'm supposedly a weirdo for including ""says shoot"" in each round of RPS while I learned that no one else does this. This came as a shock to everyone involved. We're all neighbors on this big space rock but we live in different worlds apparently. It came up because we were discussing Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni challenging potential draftees to games of Rock Paper Scissors which no doubt sheds much light on their psyches. Are they fans of brute force who favor rock? Are they cunning paper men? Or are they total freaks who prefer scissors and should be avoided at all costs? You get the picture.

That led to some casual investigation of the history of the game which thanks to Wikipedia we learned has origins in a family of games called sansukumi-ken ""meaning ken (fist) games where 'the three who are afraid of one another.'""

The earliest Japanese sansukumi-ken game was known as mushi-ken (虫拳) which was imported directly from China. In mushi-ken the ""frog"" (represented by the thumb) triumphs over the ""slug"" (represented by the little finger) which in turn prevails over the ""snake"" (represented by the index finger) which triumphs over the ""frog"". Wikipedia

This is dumb. Who ever heard of a slug beating a snake? Rock Paper Scissors is much better though perhaps not as good as the modern Indonesian variant where

the game is called suten suit or just sut and the three signs are elephant (slightly raised thumb) human (outstreched index finger) and ant (outstreched pinky finger). Elephant is stronger than human human is stronger than ant but elephant is afraid of the ant. Wikipedia

From there talk naturally led to our own strategies for the game and for ensuring a level playing field—how do you keep players (especially children) from cheating by waiting a split second to throw their sign and potentially getting to see their opponent's? The answer is priming but that's about all we were able to agree on. The following transcript from our work chat is lightly edited for clarity:

Wags if you both do it on ""shoot"" you can't really hold off imowe should have a RPS tourney one daywhen we're back in an officeBarry Petchesky let’s do it over slackLuis Paez-Pumar RPS over zoomBarry Petchesky rock paper scissors saysSHOOTi played rockLuis Paez-Pumar SAYS???Wags says?????Luis Paez-Pumar What the fuck BarryBarry Petchesky yeah rock paper scissors says shootLuis Paez-Pumar No.Wags noBarry Petchesky you assholesLuis Paez-Pumar What.No.Wags barryLuis Paez-Pumar It’s just Rock Paper Scissors shootWags yesLuis Paez-Pumar This mf said saysMaitreyi Anantharaman says???lmaoWags this mf!!!Maitreyi Anantharaman i am doing a real life lol at “says”Tom Ley barry is in mf modeBarry Petchesky what the hellgiri barry learned the game from mr. rock paperscissorsTom Ley barry went mf mode and said says!!!!!!!Albert Burneko i've def never heard ""says""Luis Paez-Pumar Barry’s in the slack room showing saysSamer i've heard a word between ""scissors"" and ""shoot"" but i didn't realize it was ""says""i thought it was like a tic or somethingKalyn Kahler its SHOOTonly shootMaitreyi Anantharaman what does this even mean barry am i to believe a rock paper and pair of scissors are saying “shoot”??Kalyn Kahler i was going to askwho is the narrator heregiri if that were the case maitreyi this mf can't manage subject-verb agreementMaitreyi Anantharaman Rock paper!

Anyway you get the idea. They were all very rude to me.

I swear I was not just pulling this out of my asshole though. I grew up playing with ""says"" and only with ""says."" Surely I cannot be alone. I did a Twitter poll and it was uh not received warmly. But 12 percent is not zero percent!!

As you've probably already surmised how you play appears to be a regional quirk of where you grew up. Much of the Western U.S. plays with the three-count shooting on ""scissors."" Centered on the populous Northeast is a bloc that prefers ""rock paper scissors shoot."" And within that range is a small enclave comprising just New York City and Long Island which plays with ""says shoot."" Here's a short blog on that from a Cornell professor for a course about human networks.

""Says shoot"" is played in a very limited geographic area—it includes me since I grew up in Manhattan but not Giri who grew up in North/Central New Jersey—but I would argue it's the best version. It extends the drama before each throw and rhythmically it's just more pleasing: there's a reason so much popular music has a four-count start with the song (the throw!) truly coming in on the fifth beat. Yet I concede that it's uncommon as just about every thread on RPS etiquette acknowledges.

So what's ""correct""? Even that is up for debate. The World Rock Paper Scissors Society's international standards on priming mandate ""rock paper scissors shoot"" with the delivery on shoot. You can see that here and you'll see it in most internationally sanctioned tournaments.

But Americans are stubborn in all things so at many informal and unsanctioned domestic competitions you'll see the more rapid three-count with the delivery on ""scissors"":

But he didn't see 'The White Album' as much of a step forward for the band.

Jimi Hendrix got to know all the top British rockers after breaking into the London scene at the close of 1966. At any given show you might find Paul McCartney John Lennon or Mick Jagger filing backstage to speak with Hendrix.

That continued into the era of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Just a few days after the release of the landmark Pepper Hendrix paid tribute to the Fab Four by covering the title track at a Saville performance. McCartney in the audience that night considered it one of the great compliments of his life.

But as Hendrix’s career took off and the Beatles’ run moved toward its close Hendrix became less wowed by the Fab Four’s output. Speaking about The White Album (1968) Hendrix saw the collection of tracks as an example of the band moving toward the past rather than the future. The Beatles Hendrix thought had become the establishment.

Jimi Hendrix saw ‘The White Album’ as like an inventory of rock’s past

By April ’69 Hendrix had already released his third and final Experience album but had yet to make his historic appearance at Woodstock. But no one doubted his place at the forefront of rock music around that period. Over the course of a few weeks Hendrix spoke with the U.K.’s International Times (via Hendrix on Hendrix).

On the subject of The Beatles Hendrix thought of the band as having passed its period of dominating the scene. “People are starting to get a little more hep to music nowadays” he told the paper. “I think The Beatles are going toward the past a little more.”

Hendrix went on to say he considered The White Album “like an inventory of the past 10 years rock music you know. There’s a lot of people waiting for something else to happen now anyway” he added. Later in the interview Hendrix cited “Happiness Is a Warm Gun” as a song that particularly didn’t work for him.

Hendrix’s description of The White Album sounded a lot like John Lennon’s summation of “Happiness Is a Warm Gun.” Lennon later described it as “sort of a history of rock ‘n’ roll.” To Hendrix that track stood out as one that showed how The Beatles had moved away from the public.

Speaking with the International Times Hendrix made it clear he still admired The Beatles as songwriters and musicians. But they’d changed for him since earlier in the ’60s. “The Beatles are part of the establishment” he said. “They’re starting to melt that way too.” Apparently the band’s first foray into political statements (“Revolution”) didn’t cut it for Jimi.

Hendrix compared it to the way young people start out trying to change things before settling into the comforts and security of middle-class existence. “That’s not saying anything bad about a person at all” Hendrix noted. “It’s just the scenes some people go through.”

The man getting to work on “Machine Gun” and other bold works wasn’t turning to The Beatles for inspiration by ’69. “It’s like a person who starts out with something really on fire” Hendrix told the International Times. “Now they’re still good […] but they seemed a little closer to the public beforehand.”",,,

We had strong organic revenue growth of over 7% on a non-GAAP basis and non-GAAP operating income grew over 8%. These results reflect the Jack Henry team's disciplined approach to cost control.""

5 Operating margin is calculated by dividing operating income by revenue. Operating margin plus operating expense components as a percentage of total revenue may not equal 100% due to rounding.

6 On August 31 2022 the Company acquired all the equity interest in Payrailz.

7 The VEDIP program was a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023.

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

The gift was made to the university’s School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) which recently recruited Caroline Freund a prominent economist at the World Bank to succeed Peter Cowhey as dean.

The Jacobs have been supporting GPS since 2006 and they have committed more than $300 million to UCSD projects since the late 1990s. The donations have been be used to do everything from help build a large university hospital in La Jolla to training engineers who focus on e-commerce and earthquake safety.

The new gift “will help (GPS) look at questions like whether it is more important for America to be a leader in electrical battery technology or quantum computing if it wants to remain a premiere center for innovation” Cowhey told the Union-Tribune on Friday April 23. “We also could look at whether the public health systems of low-income countries can be vastly improved by 5G” or fifth-generation broadband technology.

Both questions are of great interest locally. Qualcomm is the world’s largest maker of smartphone chips and is a leader in 5G technology. UCSD has a major battery-technology research program. The campus also is home to the San Diego Supercomputer Center and one of the largest computer science programs in the country.

Irwin Jacobs’ donations have been particularly important UCSD’s rise in engineering and medicine — and in the hybrid field known as in bioengineering.

At 87 he continues to nurture the program — and track how technology is evolving internationally.

“If you look at things driven by the pandemic you’ll see a lot of fast progress” Jacobs said on Friday April 23. “We’re all becoming more used to telecommunting telehealth mobile health. Education resists (this) a bit. I think we’ll find out how to do that better remotely.

“We’re seeing change. The problem is having people adjust to those changes enough so that they might benefit from them and don’t fight them.

The $14 million gift also will support Pacific Leadership Fellows a program in which leaders from around the world live in San Diego for a while to share knowledge about their home countries.

The fellows have included such figures as Agustín Carstens who served as finance minister under Mexico President Felipe Calderón and Yoriko Kawaguchi the former minister for foreign affairs in Japan.

UCSD is trying to build on its broad foundation in international affairs. Its GPS program has several well-known China experts including Susan Shirk and it is heavily involved in nuclear deterrence and non-proliferation policy.

Cowhey recently advised the Biden administration on how to better compete with China in science and technology and he has brought several prominent speakers to campus including former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

After another solid year from Josh Jacobs the Raiders gave veteran runner Kenyan Drake $11 million guaranteed in free agency.

Drake has been highly productive over the last three seasons totaling 3266 yards and 27 touchdowns in 45 games. Drake is just 27-years old and is among the most explosive runners in the league.

What made this move so fascinating is the fact that Josh Jacobs is only 23 years old and has had back-to-back 1300-yard seasons to start his career. Add on the fact the Raiders were able to get solid production out of Devontae Booker and 2020 and the move makes even less sense.

But where do Jacobs and Drake rank among the league’s best running back pairings entering the 2021 season? Well according to Bleacher Report pretty well. The site listed them as the No. 2 duo in the league. Here is a snippet of their thoughts on the pairing:

“In any given week the Raiders can feed either running back the majority touches which separates this tandem from the previous three. Keep in mind that Jacobs and Drake each eclipsed 1091 scrimmage yards last season. With the latter’s prospective role in the passing game they could do it again while on the same team.”

We can debate if the Raiders were wise to spend that much money on a No. 2 running back in free agency. However we can’t debate how much fun this pairing could be this season. If Jon Gruden can find a way to correctly balance their touches this could be a really fun backfield in 2021.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump while not being treated like a golden retriever as Trump did with his predecessor. | Wilfredo Lee/AP

“The reality is in the last month-plus … he’s been able to get the job done despite all of the efforts to undermine him” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) said. “He’s doing an effective job as speaker and building consensus both within the conference and navigating a divided government.”

One reason Johnson is passing his early leadership test is that it’s being graded on a curve. The speaker is hassled by the same unruly forces that harried McCarthy for nine months in 2023 before hounding him out of office in October. Few people will be surprised if in due course Johnson’s antlers also hang on the wall of the right-wing rec room.

At a minimum however Johnson has fortified his reputation in consequential ways. Substantively Johnson is an authentic movement conservative in a way that McCarthy never was while pushing much the same agenda and seeking the same sort of compromises: deals on federal spending foreign assistance and surveillance — all of which provoke the right.

But Johnson has been successful in isolating his critics in a way McCarthy never could. He brushed off threats to oust him from the speakership and casually dismissed one of the loudest voices Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) as an unserious lawmaker. He appears to have convinced Greene to retreat from her threats to force a vote on Johnson’s speakership (for now at least) without allowing any real concessions. Their talks he told reporters were “not a negotiation” with her requests to be “processed” in due course.

And on Tuesday Johnson made plain he expects to continue leading Republicans after the November election — which runs counter to most predictions heard in GOP circles.

“I intend to lead this conference in the future and the most important thing we have to do right now is govern the country well show the American people that we are and that’s what we have been doing” he told reporters.

Slow but skillful

To be sure Johnson’s recent swagger can — and probably should — be attributed mostly to the grace of Trump. The former president personally stuck his neck out to quell the recent uprising forcing Greene to think twice about moving against the speaker in an election year — not to mention crossing the king of MAGA himself.

Trump’s intervention may have less to do with affection for Johnson than with concern about the political backlash against what would be a new round of Republican chaos on the hill. Even still it represents a stark contrast with Trump’s decision to stand pat last fall as McCarthy faced his assassins.

“I think when your presidential nominee … is on your side against chaos I think that obviously strengthens your hand” Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) said.

But Johnson has also proved deft in recent months at handling his members. And while he has hardly achieved the formidable reputation of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who kept Democrats mostly unified in a way House Republicans haven’t been for decades — several episodes have shown him to be nimble in situations with scant room for maneuver.

Early on Johnson showed a willingness to listen to his most conservative members. They were wary of being jammed with yet another massive omnibus spending bill so he embraced a two-step approach hatched by Freedom Caucus Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) that Democrats and many GOP appropriators initially found silly. But he stuck with the idea and started building trust on the right.

More recently by converting a portion of U.S. aid to Ukraine into a “loan” he was able to frame passage of foreign assistance — a major ask from President Joe Biden and Democrats — as a win for Trump. That was an audacious spin and Trump bought it.

And when Johnson was most vulnerable last month — just when Greene’s threat to his gavel was gaining traction — he locked arms with Trump a lesson he clearly learned from his predecessor. He visited Mar-a-Lago for a news conference on “election integrity” a huge priority for Trump and was rewarded with an unofficial endorsement and timely photo op with the ex-president.

But Johnson also hasn’t bowed to Trump’s every whim the way McCarthy regularly did. When the ex-president insisted that GOP lawmakers kill an extension of foreign surveillance authorities for example Johnson bulled forward — personally providing the deciding vote on a key amendment — and got the legislation to Biden’s desk.

That’s not to say conservatives are happy with Johnson. Many on the House GOP’s rightmost flank clearly are not. “Everybody expected him to be a true conservative and to fight” said Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.). “He has just not made the decisions we thought he would make.”

Yet in the same breath Norman noted approvingly that Johnson has shown “he’s not scared of” Greene’s threats and applauded his willingness to listen.

An honest broker

Most frequently though members praise Johnson as someone who keeps his word. To put it mildly that was never a McCarthy signature.

Johnson told GOP defense hawks privately months ago he’d get Ukraine aid passed. They trusted him and he delivered at a time when most well-informed reporters and senior Republicans doubted it could ever pass the House.

The strange new respect has crept across the aisle as well. Where McCarthy enraged Democrats by reneging on a spending deal with Biden after a right-wing backlash Johnson has operated in good faith those who have negotiated against him say laying out specifically what he needs to deliver passage of critical legislation and avoiding confrontational policy demands pushed by his right flank.

They also appreciate that Johnson has stayed respectful of the opposition. Sure Johnson is still blasting the administration on their handling of college protests and the “weaponization” of the DOJ. But unlike McCarthy he’s not making deals with them one day and then attacking them personally on TV a few hours later.

Conversely Johnson has avoided making promises he can’t keep — another habit that helped precipitate McCarthy’s downfall. The fallen speaker was notorious for telling people what they wanted to hear — whether it was vowing to Trump that he’d expunge his impeachment record and not following through or promising conservative rabble-rousers more power only to change their agreement after they backed him as speaker.

Johnson also takes meetings with hard-liners and mulls over their ideas — too much some senior Republicans think. But he’s also delivered tough talk to his members in a way that McCarthy never did.

Case in point: In a recent GOP conference meeting Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) needled Johnson about how Republicans were supposed to explain to constituents that they’re not addressing the border crisis while voting to send billions of dollars to other countries. Johnson shot back with a reality check: I fought like hell for border security he told her but until Trump is president again no true border fix is possible.

“I’m frustrated with some of the votes but I realize … he hasn’t lied to us” said Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) one of the eight GOP hard-liners who voted to oust McCarthy. “His prior votes were a lot different but when you’re in leadership I understand [it’s] a different scenario.”

""There is our league and there is everybody else"" Johnson said by cellphone on Tuesday. ""I would equate the SEC in college baseball to the glory days of the American League East when every team was good.""

If you followed Wes in 3½ seasons as the Twins pitching coach from 2019 to the end of June 2022 you had to suspect this was not going to come without some evidence.

""One basic but telling statistic is that the average fastball in our league is a couple miles per hour higher than in the next best league"" Johnson said. ""Actually it was 1.6 [mph] the last time I checked.""

Likely that was on Monday after a weekend when the Bulldogs swept Vanderbilt for the first time since 2003 filling their compact Foley Field over the seating capacity of 3200. This raised Georgia to 35-12 overall 13-11 in the SEC and to No. 15 in the national rankings.

Velocity was the most-routine of the numbers that Johnson 52 has used in his quest to get the most out of pitchers which goes back to his first six years of coaching — as an assistant at Sylvan Hills High School in Arkansas.

Sixteen years later after stops at two more Arkansas high schools and four colleges (including the rising Dallas Baptist program from 2012 to 2015) the Twins hired him on Nov. 15 2018 to become new manager Rocco Baldelli's pitching coach.

He was the first-ever coach known to make that transition: from college directly to being the pitching coach for a big-league team.

That made you a baseball pioneer Wes … right?

""I didn't think of myself that way"" he said. ""I just saw it as a great opportunity to work with very good people. Working for Rocco [Baldelli] … in my mind I don't think there's a better manager. A lot of what I learned from him I'm trying to use as a head coach in college.""

Pitching theories were evolving in the 2010s at about the same rate as artificial intelligence is right now. Pitching coach Garvin Alston was ousted along with manager Paul Molitor after the 2018 season. And in came Baldelli — and Johnson.

Twins baseball boss Derek Falvey heard Johnson speak at pitching coaches clinic in ""2012 or 2013″ and repeated this Tuesday:

""The thing that stood out back then was how much he focused on development that was rooted in the newer data. Very few coaches were as curious about how to improve pitchers as Wes.""

As surprising as it was in the fall of 2018 to hire a pitching coach from college it was more so when Johnson told the Twins in late June 2022 that he had taken the pitching coach job at LSU — and wanted to leave quickly.

One reason offered for LSU needing him in midsummer was to assist with new volatile world of the transfer portal. That reason sounded thin then not so much now.

""I was able to recruit Paul Skenes and he committed to us in late July"" Johnson said. ""We also brought in another very good pitcher and were able to keep another who was going to transfer.""

Result: Skenes transferring from the Air Force Academy where he was a two-way player (including as a very tall catcher) was a superstar pitcher for LSU on its way to winning the 2023 College World Series.

He was the No. 1 overall draft choice and now all Pirates fans await his arrival as Skenes dominates in Class AAA. In fact Skenes' girlfriend — Olivia Dunne the LSU gymnast estimated to earn $3.9 million per year in NIL money — caused a stir recently by suggesting that was near.

Another of Johnson's avowed reasons for leaving the Twins was the desire to eventually become a college head coach. Georgia hired him last June 5 and then he stayed with LSU through the dramatics of the College World Series.

And get this: The Bulldogs probably will have the No. 1 overall selection in the MLB draft in 6-6 slugger Charlie Condon with home runs estimated at … well Johnson said:

""There have been a couple of 450-footers. We've been playing him at four five places for position versatility. But Charlie's been very good at third base.""

Bottom line:

As we approach the second anniversary of Wes' last game with the Twins we have better answers as to why this 5-foot-7 gent with the big pitching brain chose to return to the college game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3Mvb3BlbmluZ3MtY2xvc2luZ3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI4ODM2MjM4MC5odG1s0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2Fuc2FzY2l0eS5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9vcGVuaW5ncy1jbG9zaW5ncy9hcnRpY2xlMjg4MzYyMzgwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Johnson County Hawaiian restaurant just closed.

Trump trial: day 13

After Stormy Daniels took the stand in Donald Trump’s criminal trial his lawyers requested a mistrial—which the judge denied. They had objected to what they called “extraordinarily prejudicial” testimony by Ms Daniels a former porn star who recounted sleeping with Mr Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006.

Johnson: After 26 years of covering St. Louis' music scene I'm saying goodbye,"They say the more things change the more things stay the same whatever that really means.

All I know is this – for the past 26 years I’ve dedicated myself to documenting St. Louis’ music scene from its artists to sounds to venues and festivals and more all to the best of my ability for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

But now that will change.

In a desire to add a fresh chapter to my story prove to myself it gets greater later and hopefully make room for a new voice to emerge I am leaving the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and my music critic position to join the corporate ranks at Live Nation the world’s largest presenter of concerts and live entertainment.

I’ll be the new content editor for Live Nation Venues/Venue Nation. It’s a position wrapped around an offer I couldn’t refuse and the new role has me feeling activated all over again.

Leaving the Post-Dispatch and my coverage of all things St. Louis music and more is bittersweet. I feel as ingrained in the local music community as anyone and will miss covering it. But I also believe I’ve told the stories I needed to tell. (There were so many and still more for others to tell.) I leave behind an overstuffed body of work. My job is complete.

Covering the scene since 1998 has been one of the biggest joys of my career a surprise realization considering when I moved here I didn’t know a soul in St. Louis or anything about the place and figured I would give the city five to six years tops.

Looking back at my wall-to-wall coverage I’m reminded how much the scene has meant to me how wildly talented its players are and how so many pieces have gradually been put in place to help artists succeed.

Of course there were the bigger flashier parts of my Post-Dispatch gig interviewing national touring acts and covering their shows once they hit town.

Some of those shows I can’t forget an include Prince Beyonce Stevie Wonder U2 Coldplay Sade the Rolling Stones Outkast Bruno Mars Lady Gaga Janet Jackson J. Cole Fleetwood Mac Usher Elton John Ed Sheeran Drake Lenny Kravitz Smashing Pumpkins Garth Brooks the Chicks Robert Glasper Jr. Maxwell SZA Sting Nine Inch Nails Beck Chris Brown Red Hot Chili Peppers Erykah Badu H.E.R. Bryson Tiller and so many more.

I can’t forget Bruce Springsteen walking through the crowd at a Chaifetz Arena concert locking eyes with me and making it a point to fist bump me; or the night I caught the soccer ball Rod Stewart kicked out into the crowd; or the way the Post-Dispatch stood behind me when I laid out in a column why I would not review Morgan Wallen.

A couple of other key memories include standing between Carlos Santana and Ronald Isley backstage at the Fox Theatre while Santana told me how vital my position was. My proximity to greatness that night still blows me away as does taking a backstage picture with Queen Latifah Badu and Jill Scott a triple power punch.

And of course there was the evening in 2019 I put a VIP wristband on my mother who died in January and took her backstage with the rest of my family to meet and take a picture with Patti LaBelle at J. Scheidegger Center for the Arts.

But the heart of this gig for me wasn’t those big acts who played town for a night on tour and left. It was connecting with the St. Louisans who keep the music and entertainment scenes pulsating.

I’m talking about the singers musicians rappers producers DJs dancers and choreographers comics photographers and videographers the venue runners festival organizers publicists and promoters podcasters and influencers the tech crews fellow journalists music fans my opinionated readers and more.

Since joining the Post Dispatch I made it my mission to highlight St. Louis’ music and entertainment scenes in a major way on my platform without pause and making that coverage as important as coverage of national acts.

My underlying mission one I showed rather than told was to make sure many of those faces were Black. Representation matters and Black faces need to be seen in more than law-and-order stories.

I believe I’ve succeeded giving St. Louis artists a regular voice in their mainstream hometown newspaper unlike ever before. For the majority of them they received their first major news placement through our interviews.

Having these artists trust me with their words their life stories means the world to me. I hope I represented each and every one for who they are. I believe in them and they believe in me.

The talent in St. Louis is untapped underrated and undeniable. St. Louis artists (I’ve abandoned the term “local artists” long ago) are indeed world-class artists as Alonzo Townsend of Townsendx3 Agency often says.

This is all facts regardless of whether their goal is to perform worldwide or they’re good circling St. Louis venues.

These are artists I’ve spoken up for defended recommended and been consistently proud of. The latter was especially true watching how they wrangled their way through the pandemic making quick pivots as they embraced alternative ways to keep performing. It was a testament to their will and I was never busier during that period when there was supposedly no live music happening.

And while I have continually uplifted the community it has uplifted me in return treating me with respect and honor. I am grateful.

With a smile on my face I’ll always watch what St. Louis’ music community is up to look for artists to continue shining and hope these artists remember their best work is still in front of them.

Thanks everyone for letting me in and making sure I stayed a while.

Professor Susan Michie Director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London sits on a sub-group for the Government’s SAGE advisory body.

She is a frequent contributor on the BBC and ITV but is also a member of the Communist Party of Britain and has been for more than 40 years.

Earlier this month she co-authored an article which called for further restrictions on life in the UK and “maximum suppression” of the virus around the world.

Professor Michie’s views on suppressing coronavirus were recently described as “nonsense” by geneticist Professor Antony Brooks from Leicester University who has signed an open letter calling for an end to restrictions.

“If we continue with such stringent lockdown and suppression measures the really nasty mutations of SARS-CoV-2 (which will always be out there - and likewise for all the other respiratory viruses) will be selected over the regular strains” he said.

“Instead of keeping us safe her plan could help these strains to emerge and spread into dominance.”

Luke Johnson former chairman of Channel 4 said according to the Mail on Sunday: “Susan Michie is a member of the Communist Party. They know all about controlling behaviour in places like Communist North Korea.”

Last year she was one of three government scientific advisors who criticised Boris Johnson for defending Dominic Cummings after driving more than 250 miles during lockdown.

Her husband Professor Robert West who also works at UCL has previously tweeted that: “Conservative MPs and supporters must be feeling alarmed at what is going on in Government.

“It is nothing short of a shambles with Trumpian levels of deceit. The people of this country are being treated like idiots and I doubt they will stand for it.”

Professor Michie did not comment on her membership of the Communist Party but told the Telegraph: ""I do not support lockdown restrictions unless absolutely necessary and I frequently speak and write about the range of measures that will help prevent another one such as putting resources into making workplaces Covid safe and ensuring a well-functioning test trace and supported isolation system.

""I very much doubt that eradication is possible and this is a view that I believe is shared by most of my colleagues. The aim of maximum suppression is to get Covid-19 down to a low enough level that local outbreaks can be dealt with by Test Trace and Isolate.",,,,,,,,,
JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2Fwci8yNC9ob3ctanAtbW9yZ2FuLWFuZC1qYW1pZS1kaW1vbi1zY29yZWQtYS1zcGVjdGFjdWxhci1vd24tZ29hbC1vbi10aGUtZXNs0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvYXByLzI0L2hvdy1qcC1tb3JnYW4tYW5kLWphbWllLWRpbW9uLXNjb3JlZC1hLXNwZWN0YWN1bGFyLW93bi1nb2FsLW9uLXRoZS1lc2w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How JP Morgan and Jamie Dimon scored a spectacular own goal on the ESL,"The European Super League (ESL) was touted as the only way for elite football clubs to “recover” from the coronavirus pandemic and “make people dream” about the beautiful game again.

The €3.25bn (£2.8bn) deal also stood to make JP Morgan Chase the US investment bank providing the funding about £2m a week in interest payments for 23 years under the terms of the contract – making it probably one of the most lucrative sports financing deals in history.

But just three days after being announced the bank’s dream of a money-spinning “closed” ESL was effectively dead. The proposal had achieved the rare feat of uniting football fans and players as well as Prince William Boris Johnson Keir Starmer and the prime ministers of France and Italy in opposition.

On Friday JP Morgan which is run by billionaire banker Jamie Dimon finally admitted its mistake in a very short statement. “We clearly misjudged how this deal would be viewed by the wider football community and how it might affect them in the future” the bank said.

JPM which made a record profit of $12bn (£8.6bn) in the first three months of the year (or $130m-a-day) then added just five more words: “We will learn from this.”

The spectacular collapse of the deal in the face of opposition from so many quarters has prompted fresh questioning of the Wall Street bank’s ethics just weeks after chief executive Dimon told shareholders in his annual letter that he was a good citizen and part of the community: “We take great pride in being a responsible citizen at the local level – just like the local bakery.”

Dimon 65 added: “We have long championed the essential role of banking in a community – its potential for bringing people together. For enabling companies and individuals to reach for their dreams.”

The ESL plans have indeed brought people together but only in anger and with much of it focused on JP Morgan and Dimon.

Lord Jim O’Neill of Gatley former chief economist at Goldman Sachs and lifelong Manchester United fan described the ESL plan as “one of the most ridiculous proposals I’ve ever seen in my life” and said it called into question Dimon’s judgment.

“How on earth did such an experienced chief executive that is so good … on connecting with the real world how on earth did they let themselves get this proposal to where it got?” O’Neill said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.

“It is ridiculous and epitomises so much that has become wrong about modern sport and in particular football.”

Dimon who was paid $31.5m (£22.7m) last year and is estimated by Forbes magazine to be sitting on a personal fortune of $1.8bn has so far not spoken publicly about the collapsed deal.

But while the bank now says it “misjudged” the scale of public feeling about the deal it is known that some bankers raised serious misgivings months before the deal was completed. JP Morgan called on its “public responsibility committee” to investigate the merits of the proposal which was approved despite some on the committee advising against going ahead.

Critics both inside and outside the bank again point to Dimon’s letter sent to shareholders earlier in April in which he said: “To a good company its reputation is everything. That reputation is earned day in and day out with every interaction with customers and communities.

“When I hear examples of people doing something that is wrong because they could be paid more it makes my blood boil – and I don’t want them working here.”

Aleksander Ceferin the president of the European governing body Uefa described the JP Morgan-backed ESL plan as “a closed shop run by a greedy select few”.

Under the league plans the owners of the 12 founding teams – nicknamed the “dirty dozen” by Uefa’s vice-president Karl-Erik Nilsson – would have received a €200m to €300m “welcome bonus” with funds from JP Morgan.

Many of the clubs – Milan Arsenal Atlético Madrid Chelsea Barcelona Internazionale Juventus Liverpool Manchester City Manchester United Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur – are owned by billionaires.

Sajid Javid the former Conservative chancellor who was hired by JP Morgan last year as a part-time adviser on a £150000 annual salary hit out at them and by inference his new employer’s backing for them.

“I’m shocked that in the middle of what’s become an existential crisis for many football clubs this clique of owners have displayed such appalling selfishness and a callous disregard for their fans” he said.

“A super league monopoly strikes at the very spirit of the beautiful game – it shuts out the underdog offends our British sense of fair play and reduces football to numbers on a spreadsheet.”

Before the plans were scrapped Javid called on the government to introduce a “new super tax” on football club profits. “That should splash enough red ink on their spreadsheets to quickly put an end to these destructive anti-competitive proposals.”

Dimon who has four times been named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world has also hired the former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna to leads the bank’s environmental and social responsibility governance work in Europe. Umunna who only started work there on 12 April did not respond to a request for comment.

One of JP Morgan’s biggest clients is Stan Kroenke the billionaire owner of Arsenal the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams and the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. JP Morgan lent Kroenke $2bn to finance the Rams’ stadium project. The bank has also arranged an $800m loan for 16 US basketball teams and helped raise €575m for Real Madrid to rebuild the Bernabéu stadium.

While Dimon has not yet spoken about the bank’s spectacular own goal with its backing for the ESL he sent his top lieutenant Daniel Pinto co-president and chief operating officer on to business TV channel Bloomberg to defend the bank.

Pinto who is Argentinian said the bank had done nothing wrong it had just provided a loan. “It’s football it’s very emotional” he said. “We were expecting this to be emotional we were expecting people to have different opinions. [But] I don’t think there is reputational damage here.

“We arranged a loan for a client. It’s not our place to decide the optimal way for football to operate in Europe and the UK” he said in the interview which was recorded on Tuesday 20 April but not broadcast until Friday.

But after the deal collapsed on Wednesday Pinto said: “It is clear we misjudged the magnitude of feeling that this deal would create and we will learn from this experience as a company. In the end football fans were heard loud and clear and that’s what matters most.”

While Pinto insisted the deal would not hit the bank’s reputation the independent rating agency Standard Ethics begged to differ and downgraded JPM’s sustainability rating and said the bank’s actions were “contrary to sustainability best practices”. Its corporate rating from reduced from “adequate” to “non-compliant”.

Dimon the son of Greek immigrants to New York has worked at JP Morgan since 2000 and rose to become chief executive in 2005. In the wake of the financial crisis Dimon said government bailouts of big banks was “ethically bankrupt” and regulators should instead let market forces play out. “The term ‘too big to fail’ must be excised from our vocabulary” he has said.

Dimon a lifelong Democrat has become known for speaking his mind on social and political issues as well as economic policy and has had run-ins with former Bank of England governor Mark Carney US Senator Elizabeth Warren and former president Donald Trump.

In 2018 he ignited speculation that he might enter the running for the 2020 presidential election when he told reporters at a glitzy event at the bank’s Park Avenue headquarters that he “could beat Trump”. “I’m as tough as he is I’m smarter than he is. I would be fine. He could punch me all he wants it wouldn’t work with me. I’d fight right back.”

Trump retorted: “The problem with banker Jamie Dimon running for president is that he doesn’t have the aptitude or ‘smarts’… is a poor public speaker & nervous mess.

“Otherwise” the former president said “he is wonderful.”

When Jamie Dimon speaks …

As the chief executive of the US’s biggest bank when Jamie Dimon speaks a lot of people listen. And Dimon speaks out often on everything from the politics and the economy to the housing crisis community values rising inequality the minimum wage gay marriage and trans rights.

Just before the ESL debacle Dimon wrote: “To a good company its reputation is everything. That reputation is earned day in and day out with every interaction with customers and communities … When I hear examples of people doing something that is wrong because they could be paid more it makes my blood boil – and I don’t want them working here.”

In 2016 he said: “America has the best hand ever dealt to any country on this planet ever. Yes we have problems but you travel around the world you’ll see we have it all.”

In 2017 he said: “[It is] almost an embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country.”

In a jibe at Trump in 2018: “I’m smarter than he is. And by the way this wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money – it wasn’t a gift from Daddy.”

In 2010 he told a congressional panel investigating the 2008 financial crisis: “My daughter asked me when she came home from school ‘What’s the financial crisis?’ and I said ‘it’s something that happens every five to seven years’.”

In 2010 after JPM evicted hundreds of thousands of people from their homes after the sub-prime mortgage crisis: “We’re not evicting people who deserve to stay in their house … We don’t think there are cases where people have been evicted out of homes where they shouldn’t have been.”

Dimon’s management advice: “Don’t do anything stupid. And don’t waste money. Let everybody else waste money and do stupid things; then we’ll buy them.”

Dimon on bitcoin in 2017: “It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed. It’s just not a real thing eventually it will be closed … My daughter bought bitcoin it went up and now she thinks she’s a genius.”

Dimon on gay marriage in 2017: “This is good for our company and clients but more importantly it’s the right thing to do. The rights of all people are important and must be protected.”

Dimon on the yawning US inequality gap in 2019: “A big chunk of [people] have been left behind. Forty percent of Americans make less than $15 an hour. Forty percent of Americans can’t afford a $400 bill whether it’s medical or fixing their car. Fifteen percent of Americans make minimum wages 70000 die from opioids [annually].”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFscmV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0L2FkdmVudHVyZXMtaW4tZXNnLWpwbW9yZ2Fucy1vd24tZ29hbC1hbmQtb3RoZXItc3Rvcmllcy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRpb25hbHJldmlldy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC9hZHZlbnR1cmVzLWluLWVzZy1qcG1vcmdhbnMtb3duLWdvYWwtYW5kLW90aGVyLXN0b3JpZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adventures in ESG — JPMorgan’s Own Goal and Other Stories,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHRzLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXByb2plY3QtaGF2ZW4tZmFpbGVkLTExMTgzOTE5Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Warren Buffett's health care project Haven failed,"Haven the joint venture of three of the largest companies in America — Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A BRK-B) Amazon (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) — once threatened to disrupt the health care system of the U.S. But less than three years later it unceremoniously fizzled out in February.

Other than a press release from Haven at the time of its disbanding only JPM CEO Jamie Dimon has publicly addressed the failed venture. But Warren Buffett watchers may wonder if the Berkshire CEO will discuss the breakup and the state of U.S. health care at the conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting on May 1 which will be streamed live exclusively on Yahoo Finance.

The joint venture was formed with the goal of improving the health care experience and lowering costs of care for their employees in January 2018. As large employers the trio saw firsthand how quickly the costs of health care were rising as employer-based health care remains one of the largest sources of health insurance coverage in the country.

So why did it fail? Largely the venture failed to take off because the U.S. health care system is just too complex to be disrupted experts have said. Haven also faced competition from entrenched players in the health care system and despite their size and reach the three companies had trouble obtaining necessary data that could help them better control costs the Wall Street Journal reported in January citing people familiar with the project's budget. Moreover the venture had unclear goals.

All told the failure of Haven was “not so much because employers or insurers had never tried to control costs. It was always unclear what new value-add Haven brought to the table"" according to Loren Adler an expert with the Brookings Institute.

Dimon in his annual letter to shareholders on April 7 noted that even though Haven disbanded JPM will ""continue to build on what we learned"" stating that the problems that existed when Haven formed in 2018 still exist.

""Our costs are more than twice those of the developed world without justification by better outcomes"" he said. ""We will invest in healthcare innovation and other approaches to improve the health and well-being of our employees and address this critical national issue. More details will be shared as we progress"" he added.

Stakes in different parts of the health care system

The trio also failed to get their venture off the ground because they had stakes in different parts of the health system and according to several reports were never able to align their goals.

Story continues

Berkshire owns shares in several health care companies including big pharmaceuticals like Merck (MRK) Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) as well as dialysis giant DaVita (DVA).

Amazon expanded its interest in the mail-order pharmacy business with its acquisition of PillPack which it has now transformed into Amazon Pharmacy — with many anticipating an even greater expansion into pharmacy services soon. Its cloud service AWS is increasingly playing a role behind the scenes for all types of health entities including hospitals. The e-commerce giant has also launched clinics for its employees which could expand to the general population.

Meanwhile JPM maintains a significant presence in the industry ranging from its well-known annual health conference in San Francisco to the various services for health companies and research into health policies and issues.

Dr. Atul Gawande who led the joint venture until he left in the middle of last year told Yahoo Finance recently that there are some areas where the private sector can take the lead but — as the pandemic has shown — the U.S.'s weak public health sector needs attention to strengthen the industry overall.

Greater investment into public health is needed in order for the country to avoid being caught flat-footed again at the onset of what is likely to be another pandemic in the future he said.

""We're not committed as a country even now to making sure everyone has coverage everyone has a doctor and they're part of a system that can reach you. That's part of the difficulty that's made this so specifically difficult in the United States"" Gawande said.

Schwarzman said. “Israel is one of the most promising markets in the world in these areas and Yifat is the perfect choice to scale our firm’s presence and investments there.”There had been talk of Blackstone developing an Israeli presence in the past including talks in 2012 of a joint venture with Israel’s Blackstone Group. However those never materialized.“We are big believers in Israel which is one of the most dynamic and innovative markets in the world” said Jon Korngold global head of Blackstone Growth. “I’m delighted to welcome Yifat an outstanding technology executive and leader to help us bring the full power of the Blackstone platform and our resources to the country’s entrepreneurs.”Prior to serving as the CEO of Bank Leumi ’s technology banking platform Oron spent most of her career as a partner at Vertex Venture Capital where she invested in and served as a board member of companies across the tech ecosystem.Before that she was a technology investment-banking associate at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York and spent three years at the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of R&D where she achieved the rank of lieutenant in the Economics Budget and Control Department. She has an MBA from Tel Aviv University and a BSc in economics and management from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.“I’m thrilled to join Blackstone and lead the firm’s growth investments in Israel” Oron said. “The breadth of what Blackstone can deliver to entrepreneurs in terms of capital and operating expertise is truly world-class. I’m excited to help fast-growing companies in Israel become global leaders through Blackstone’s resources and global network.”"

But while it’s notable that the jolly green giant of the semiconductor industry has decided to wade into the data center CPU market Intel and AMD probably don’t have anything to worry about at least for now.

Nvidia’s Grace CPU — announced at GTC 2021 and named for Grace Hopper the U.S. computer programming pioneer — took many by surprise. But it’s probably not what you think it is. And the chipmaker’s decision to call this a CPU while technically correct doesn’t help clear things up either.

You might be thinking a CPU is a CPU so clearly Nvidia is picking a fight with team blue and team red. But the answer is actually no.

Grace isn’t like other CPUs and that’s kind of why Nvidia designed it in the first place. But before I explain why Nvidia is making this thing let me explain what makes it different.

Grace Isn’t Your Run-of-the-Mill CPU

Traditionally CPUs from Intel AMD and even newcomers like Marvell and Ampere are designed with a wide array of use cases in mind. These companies make general compute processors that can be deployed in everything from laptops and workstations to 5G base stations and hyperscale data centers.

Grace is a bit more specialized. Scratch that it’s a whole lot more specialized. And to confuse things even more it’s not even the CPU cores that actually make it unique. Grace will use Arm’s Neoverse N2 core design which is just an updated version of what Marvell and Ampere are already using in many of their products.

If you look at Grace’s estimated SPECrate 2017 Integer benchmark scores of 300 it won’t even be that fast. AMD’s 2-year-old EPYC Rome 7742 used in Nvidia’s DGX A100 server platform is actually faster by that measure. So while a score of 300 is honestly respectable by today’s standards I somehow doubt that spec will hold up nearly as well in two years.

I’m actually surprised Nvidia even threw this number out there. As far as I can tell CPU performance while important isn’t really the point of this chip. Arguably the more important feature is how Grace will communicate with other peripherals specifically GPUs.

GPUs typically communicate with CPUs over the PCIe standard. And usually this works out great. PCIe Gen 4.0 and soon PCIe Gen 5.0 are ridiculously fast — and I’d argue 99% of the time complete overkill. That is unless you happen to be training a massive artificial intelligence (AI) model with a trillion or more parameters. In this exotic-sounding scenario even PCIe Gen 5.0 which when commercially available will deliver upwards of 512 Gb/s of bandwidth to a single device can become a bottleneck.

And clearly Nvidia thinks this scenario is going to get a whole lot more common in the coming years. It’s this niche use case that Nvidia created Grace to address. Instead of PCIe Nvidia is directly coupling the CPU cores and critically the system memory to its GPUs over the company’s proprietary NVLink interconnect technology. And it’s really fast: A little back-of-the-napkin math indicates that each NVLink connection will provide 16 Tb/s of throughput per device. Grace will support up to four to-be-announced GPUs connected over NVLink for an aggregate of 64 Tb/s of total throughput.

Because of this Grace doesn’t make much sense unless you’re using it in a system with at least four of Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs and even then only when running AI workloads so large they can’t fit in the GPU’s video memory.

So should Intel or AMD be worried about Grace? Maybe but only in exceedingly large HPC environments where specialized CPUs from companies like Fujitsu aren’t uncommon.

Don’t Hold Your Breath for More Nvidia CPUs

In a press conference last week Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang basically said Nvidia wasn’t interested in competing in the CPU space and argued that Grace was a special case.

“As a philosophy we tend not to do anything unless the world needs us to do it and it doesn’t exist. When you look at the Grace architecture it’s very unique and it doesn’t look like anything else out there and it also solves a problem that didn’t used to exist” Huang said responding to questions concerning the company’s ambitions in the CPU market.

Let’s not forget outside of gaming Nvidia is essentially unchallenged in the data center GPU market. AMD and Intel both have emerging GPUs in the space but they are relatively small players by comparison. Neither company has anything that comes close to Nvidia’s A100 series GPUs. By comparison the CPU market is getting rather crowded these days.

So unless the existing crop of CPU vendors suddenly become deficient in their ability to solve the next great computing problem Huang is essentially saying he’d rather work with these companies than fight them.

Nvidia is already working with Amazon Ampere and Marvell to add support for its GPUs and has long-standing relationships with both Intel and AMD.

And given Nvidia’s pending acquisition of Arm Holdings for $40 billion this makes a certain kind of sense. The chipmaker has already said it plans to license its graphics and networking intellectual property through Arm. I find it far more likely that we’ll see Nvidia graphics and AI capabilities embedded in CPUs from partner companies than a branded general-purpose CPU at least in the data center.

The consumer space might be a different story and it will be interesting to see what happens to Nvidia’s Tegra CPUs used in Nintendo’s Switch gaming consoles — yep while Nvidia already makes CPUs low power ones anyway — moving forward.

So at least in my mind until such a time comes that Nvidia feels that the CPU vendors have failed to keep up with customer demand and it can do better I don’t see them going toe to toe with AMD’s EPYC or Intel’s Xeon platforms.

By Kim Bo-eun



Personal care manufacturer Yuhan-Kimberly is stepping up efforts to engage customers by continuing to be a socially responsible company.



Last month it launched a campaign in which participants upload photos wearing masks. Yuhan-Kimberly decided to donate 10 masks to delivery workers and bus drivers for every participant setting aside a total of 100000 masks for that purpose.



The company said that the campaign was designed to raise awareness about the importance of wearing masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic.



Yuhan-Kimberly also hosted an event in which it donated menstrual pads after reaching its viewership target for a live session.



The company earlier pledged to donate 100000 pads if the show managed to attract 100000 viewers. More than 150000 viewers joined the show.



This pledge enabled a 250-percent increase in the sales of pads from sales generated through a live show held a month earlier.



Earlier Yuhan-Kimberly held another menstrual pad donation campaign which garnered 170000 supporters and 1098 donors.



The company has been donating 1 million pads to underprivileged women and teenagers every year since 2016. It has donated 6.17 million pads so far.



""It appears that trust has been built up between Yuhan-Kimberly and consumers as we have continued to host campaigns that seek to show our sincerity"" an official in charge of corporate social responsibility (CSR) at the company said.



""We will continue efforts to exert a good influence on society through donations to which consumers can relate.""



Yuhan-Kimberly has been leading the corporate social responsibility movement. It is known for its campaign in which it has planted and cared for 54 million trees since 1984.



The company was set up in 1970 as a joint venture between U.S.―based Kimberly-Clark and the Korean pharmaceutical firm Yuhan Corporation. Among its products are: Huggies baby diapers menstrual pads and Kleenex tissues.

In a way he never stopped.

Now a 56-year-old IT professional Guggeri also runs a small Facebook group aimed at “everyone who prefers coffee made with a Moka.”

“All the alternatives to the Moka are designed to make coffee faster or in a more practical way” Guggeri told Fortune. “But faster and more practical doesn’t always mean better.”

Making the highly potent coffee with a stovetop Moka pot is a sensory experience. There’s the gravely metal-on-metal sound made when the top and bottom chambers screw together. Minutes later you get the gurgling of the coffee as the boiling water bubbles up through the grinds and the rich aroma that fills the room when the coffee is ready. Talk to any fan of the Moka coffee pots and the word “ritual” comes up over and over.

Alfonso Bialetti—an aluminum worker and tinkerer inspired by the washing machines of the day—invented the Moka Express pot in 1933. (The type of coffee the pots make should not be confused with caffè mocha the hot drink that is a blend of hot chocolate and espresso.)

The eponymous company Bialetti founded has sold more than 200 million coffee pots since then including the post-World War II boom years when the Bialetti Moka pot was one of the first luxury items members of the new Italian middle class allowed themselves. It is now estimated that around three in four Italian households have a Moka pot in the kitchen. The design is so iconic that it appears in the permanent collection at New York’s Museum of Modern Art and many other design collections around the world.

Yet in 2018 Bialetti was teetering on the brink of insolvency. The company based in Coccaglio (around 45 miles east of Milan) was more than €70 million in debt and suffering a slow death at the hands of faster and more convenient capsule-based coffee machines a fast-growing market dominated by multinationals Coca-Cola Nestlé Kraft-Heinz and Unilever.

Food giant Nestlé this week reported impressive quarterly sales helped by a surge in Nespresso coffee pods as the in-home boom for a strong shot of caffeine continues under lockdown.

Indestructible

Bialetti is getting a big taste of this shift in coffee consumption too. But there is a kink in Bialetti’s business strategy: Moka pots are virtually indestructible. Guggeri for example said he has four Moka Express pots at home but he didn’t buy any of them. All are hand-me-downs at least 30 years old and still working as well as ever.

The coronavirus pandemic has helped Bialetti strengthen its position to a degree: with coffee bars across Italy and beyond closed or only partially open during a series of lockdowns more people are making their coffee at home. But according to Elisa Albanese Bialetti’s head of marketing the company’s turnaround began before the lockdowns.

“We saw that the big coffee companies were advertising their coffee as ‘perfect for the Moka’ and we asked ourselves who is better equipped to make coffee for the Moka than the company that invented the Moka?” Albanese asked.

The result she told Fortune was to transform the company that made Mocha coffee makers and other kitchen equipment into one focused on every aspect of at-home coffee making a makeover that is still ongoing. “We are evolving from the ‘World of the Home’ to the ‘World of Coffee’” she said.

In business terms that means the company has entered into the competitive ground coffee sector with a new “Perfetto Moka” brand in addition to a range of designer mugs cups and other service items coffee grinders and even non-native coffee makers like the French Press. The company is even joining the coffee pod revolution albeit with a Bialetti twist— the Bialetti coffee pods can be broken down into recyclable components eliminating one of the main criticisms of other coffee pods – that they end up filling up landfills.

More products are in development Albanese said.

Bialetti bull run

Moka Express sales are climbing. According to company data Bialetti sold around 3.5 million units a year between 2015 and 2017 slowly rising to 4 million last year with a target of 5 million this year. Albanese said the company is regaining market share by stressing the sustainability of the coffee pots—the only waste product is the coffee grinds (which many users turn into compost); Moka Express pots don’t even have a disposable coffee filter—and marketing to a new generation of coffee drinkers who see the coffee pot as something from their parents’ or grandparents’ generation.

Investors are excited. The company is still operating in the red but as it approaches a break-even point its shares traded in Milan are up nearly 130 percent over the last 12 months and they have gained 225 percent so far this year to sit at a two-year high.

Dominic Allport a London-based foodservice analyst with NPD Group a consultancy said Bialetti’s new focus on the broader coffee market has the potential to be a winning strategy.

“Smart diversification is key” Allport told Fortune. “In this case the Moka pot supports the image of the ground coffee which supports the image of the other equipment. It is a wise decision not to put all the company’s eggs— or in this case all its coffee beans—in one basket.”

According to Jake Leonti editor of Coffee Talk Magazine the larger consumer shift toward the nostalgic tastes of the past is working in Bialetti’s favor.

In an interview with Fortune Leonti listed a dozen or so coffee-making systems he owns ranging from a high-end and costly pump coffee maker to a simple French Press and pour-over system. Yet he said he still turns to his classic Moka Express with surprising frequency.

“There’s something very satisfying about using the Moka” Leonti said. “We’re paying more attention these days to health and wellness and slow food and traditional methods. The Moka fits nicely into that context.

“I see the Moka Express coffee makers a little like vinyl records in the face of the CDs and MP3s represented by the coffee pod machines” he said. “And we see how well vinyl is doing now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGFsa2luZy1wb2ludHMvc3Rvcnkvc2hvdWxkLXlvdS1idXktZG9nZWNvaW4tb25lLWJpZy1yZWFzb24td2h5LXlvdS1zaG91bGQtbm90LTE3OTQ0NTQtMjAyMS0wNC0yNNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RhbGtpbmctcG9pbnRzL3N0b3J5L3Nob3VsZC15b3UtYnV5LWRvZ2Vjb2luLW9uZS1iaWctcmVhc29uLXdoeS15b3Utc2hvdWxkLW5vdC0xNzk0NDU0LTIwMjEtMDQtMjQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should you buy Dogecoin? One big reason why you should not,"Dogecoin is the protagonist of a cryptocurrency tale that no one could have predicted beforehand. As the fame of the meme cryptocurrency grew its market value dwindled in the last couple of weeks like a candle flame in the wind. It experienced an unimaginable high and came crashing down soon after.

What started as a joke of a cryptocurrency hit a record peak earlier this week with a jaw-dropping market capitalisation of more than $50 billion. This made Dogecoin bigger than the automobile giant Ford Motor Co and American food and beverage company Kraft Heinz Co in market value.

The rise was fueled right before April 20 a day that is celebrated as Doge Day. Fans of the cryptocurrency invested in it in the masses and skyrocketed its price to a record high. Dogecoin was hailed on various social media platforms and of course had the backing of tech icon Elon Musk.

It was going well until it all came tumbling down. As investors realised that the surge was just too much to hold its value for long they retracted their money bringing down around $45 billion of the market cap out of $50 billion within a couple of days. After all what else would you expect of a digital currency that came into existence as a joke?

Getting to know Dogecoin

Dogecoin came into being in the year 2013 as a way to lighten up the uptight all-math cryptocurrency market. Even the name Dogecoin came as a parody based on the Shiba Inu dog a popular Internet meme at the time.

When Jackson Palmer an Adobe employee started it out with his partner Billy Markus the duo never knew that the digital currency would reach such heights. All because the coin's importance was taken a bit too seriously by a lively community of enthusiasts on online forums.

The mutual thought was the inclusion of a just-for-fun currency in the crypto market that can enthrall very simple transactions such as online tipping or possibly donations. The currency was not taken seriously until around 2018 when it briefly touched a market cap of $2 billion during the crypto surge.

The numbers however could not make Dogecoin as famous as Musk did. Several and periodic tweets by the Tesla CEO hailing Dogecoin as the best ever cryptocurrency sent everyone related to the crypto market in a frenzy. People began to start asking about Dogecoin and whether to invest in it or not.

Dogecoin the technical side

That is probably also why you are reading this article. But before you can grasp the answer you should know how the cryptocurrency works vis-a-vis other cryptocurrencies out there. In short the technical aspect of it.

At the surface Dogecoin is just another cryptocurrency. It is only when you understand its use case that you get to know its pros and cons. An example of this is the fast transaction speed associated with Dogecoin that too at very low transaction fees. This is one of the biggest pluses of the digital currency.

advertisement

The reason for this is that Dogecoin was invented to have fun and not make investors money. The cryptocurrency was thus built to exist in excess quantities and by excess I mean infinite.

This is also the main difference between Dogecoin and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has a finite amount of coins on the blockchain more and more Dogecoin will keep on getting produced every year. In essence there is an unlimited supply of Dogecoin on the blockchain.

The very nature of the cryptocurrency thus keeps its prices much low as compared to others. It also helps keep the value steady in a volatile market a notion that we saw failing miserably in recent times.

To invest or not

This low value of Dogecoin and the fact that it will remain so did not make it an appealing proposition to investors that is until recently. Once the world saw Dogecoin's monumental growth everyone wanted to take a bite of the pie.

advertisement

The downfall was even more shocking than the rise as it left many confused about what to expect from the cryptocurrency. We reached out to an expert on cryptocurrencies for some insights into this.

Edul Patel CEO and Co-founder Mudrex - a crypto trading platform - said ""Doge is literally a meme coin built out of the intent to mock the concept of bitcoin. Hence it is extremely volatile and susceptible to random market movements.""

Suggesting against putting your money into it he said “I would not recommend allocating funds here for the long term. On the other hand a lot of people would just want to bet and be a part of it for fun and get the 'gamblers rush' That is completely your choice!”

That being said the Dogecoin community has made extensive use of the currency for philanthropic purposes. People tend to donate to organisations and causes through Dogecoin. As long as the currency stands for such purposes its follower community is enough to stabilise the crypto in the market.

As for investing in Dogecoin another big reason for not doing so in India is the impending decisions by the Indian government around cryptocurrencies. In a major move that has been hinted at for since long the centre might impose an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading in the country as it has done once before. Any investments in Dogecoin will certainly not be profitable then.

For now people can evaluate the decision to back Dogecoin or not as they deem fit.",,,,,,,,,

""The waste is really mindboggling"" admits Jennifer Molidor PhD senior food campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity.

To complicate matters most supermarkets don't track their food waste which means there's no clear data on how much edible food ends up in dumpsters instead of shopping carts. ReFED a national nonprofit working to end food waste estimated that retailers generated 10.5 million tons of food waste sending almost one-third of wasted food to the landfill.

Despite concerns about the environmental impacts of wasted food from squandered resources required to grow process and transport foods to the methane food waste generates in the landfill Molidor believes waste is built into the supermarket retail strategy.

""Overstocking is business as usual"" she says. ""The consumer is much more likely to buy a head of lettuce when it's one in a pile of 20 heads of lettuce.""

Some supermarkets are stepping up to address food waste according to the report Slow Road to Zero. The annual report card ranking supermarkets on their path to zero waste found that Kroger Walmart and Ahold Delhaize (a chain that includes Food Lion Giant and Fresh Direct) earned ""A"" grades for food waste reduction efforts.

These grocers incorporated strategies included reporting volumes of food waste and implementing purchasing strategies such as forecasting and ordering tools to reduce food waste. All three supermarkets have also committed to achieving zero food waste by 2025.

""While [supermarkets] are not the biggest wedge in the food waste pie it's still significant because these retailers manage so much food"" says Dana Gunders executive director for ReFED. ""There is a lot of effort happening in retail; [grocers] are certainly trying.""

Grocery gains (and losses)

In 2017 Kroger established a Zero Hunger/Zero Waste effort aimed at reducing food waste. Their 2020 data shows that the grocer generated 288966 tons of food waste and diverted 44.7% from the landfill (up from 27.1% in 2017). The would-be food waste was sent to animal food operations composting facilities and anaerobic digesters. The supermarket also partners with Feeding America to send surplus foods to food banks in local communities.

Other grocers have made lesser commitments. Albertsons and New Seasons Markets were among the grocers in Oregon Washington and California that joined the Pacific Coast Collaborative committing to reducing the amount of wasted food by 50% by 2030. (Kroger also signed on to the voluntary agreement but has more robust food waste reduction goals).

While some grocers have made good progress in addressing food waste Gunders believes ""there is still a lot of food going to waste and it's often food that could be…donated and there are solutions that could be implemented.""

A growing awareness of the impact of food waste hasn't been enough to compel grocers like Costco Publix and Trader Joe's to make public commitments to food waste reduction. The markets have also failed to implement transparent data tracking or comprehensive prevention strategies. As a result the supermarkets earned ""D"" grades in the Slow Road to Zero report.

Some of the food waste efforts supermarkets have implemented including ""ugly food"" campaigns which encourage shoppers to choose imperfect produce have been unsuccessful. Research published in the Journal of Marketing found that consumers avoided so-called ugly produce and their attitudes led to increased store waste and decreased sales. Moreover Molidor notes that recycling blemished unsold produce into the smoothie bar or incorporating it into baked goods makes minimal impact on overall waste reduction.

Grocers that operate donation programs (also called food recovery programs) are able to divert an estimated 20% of edible foods from the landfill and donate it to food pantries and other organizations helping those dealing with food insecurity. Expectations that supermarkets will donate excess food are high with consumers calling out ""bad actors"" that are failing to send excess food to food pantries.

Fred Meyer a supermarket chain based out of Portland Oregon owned by Kroger made national headlines earlier this year when staff tossed food into dumpsters following a power outage. Crowds tried to rescue the foods which the grocer deemed ""unfit for consumption or donation"" and police were called. The event sparked conversations about wasted food and food donations.

Possible solutions

Legislation could play a role and already has in reducing food waste in supermarkets.

France was a pioneer in excess food laws enacting legislation in 2016 that banned supermarkets from throwing out edible food. It's been suggested that the law sparked the development of ""a whole ecosystem of businesses that are helping grocery stores better manage their stocks and reduce food waste.""

In the U.S. seven states including California Connecticut and Massachusetts have passed bills that restrict food waste from going to the landfill.

New York state assemblyman Tom Abinanti co-sponsored the Excess Food Act. The bill which goes into effect in June 2021 requires supermarkets with over 10000 square feet of retail space to donate excess food to food banks soup kitchens and other relief agencies that request donations.

""Supermarkets don't want to sell [food] that's close to the expiration date because customers won't buy it"" Abinanti says. ""The food is still good if it's approaching — or even if it passes —the 'sold by' date [and] it can be distributed; we don't have to worry about it spoiling.""

New technologies are also helping grocers reduce their food waste. The app Too Good To Go launched in Denmark and has been rolled out across 15 countries in Europe and the U.K. to alert customers about excess food allow in-app purchases at discounted prices that are picked up in the stores before food goes to waste. Developers expect to roll out the app in the U.S. later this year.

Gunders believes these ""flash sale"" apps have the potential to reduce food waste. Other tools including enhanced demand planning that use Big Data to help supermarkets predict demand and order the right amount of foods could also cut down on wasted food.

""Retailers manage huge amounts of food and are so influential in the food system"" Gunders says. ""It's always been important to grocery stores to be good community institutions and they are starting to see [food waste reduction] more as a way to do that [but] there are opportunities for them to do more.""

For food waste reduction efforts to be successful Molidor notes that supermarkets must first commit to achieving zero waste set a target date and provide transparent data to consumers about their efforts. With those tools she believes supermarkets could achieve zero food waste by 2025.

""It's an ambitious goal"" she admits. ""If Walmart which is a massive company can do it other companies can do it too.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlZWJsZXNmdW5lcmFsaG9tZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jYXRoeS1yaWNoYXJkc29u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cathy Renee (Pendley) Richardson Obituary 2021,"Cathy Renee Pendley Richardson age 64 resident of Eads Tennessee and wife of Willie Richardson departed this life Sunday morning April 25 2021 at St. Francis Hospital in Bartlett Tennessee.

Thus we present another True Or False brought to you by law firm of Null & Void:

OK sports fans true or false: At Cincinnati Reds home games the sign in left field that tracks the number of strikeouts by Reds pitchers with a string of “K’s” does not include the third strikeout after it occurs thus avoiding the appearance of “KKK”?

True!

According to longtime Cincinnati sports radio host Andy Furman as well as his listeners after the fourth strikeout the third K is inserted thus the sign next reads “KKKK.” Until then the third strikeout is withheld and the sign reads “KK.”

This is to avoid any appearance that the Reds are endorsing supporting or promoting the Ku Klux Klan. Seriously. Otherwise those attending the ballgames might think there’s a Klan meeting being held just beyond the left-field wall!

But the KKK would choose to rally in extreme right field not left. And it’s not enough that communists — “Reds” — and the Klan have for decades been mortal enemies.

But these Reds are taking no chances even if the “K’s” are posted in conjunction with a separate local sponsorship promotion that offers free pizza if Cincy pitchers reach 11 strikeouts.

What if it’s one of those seven-inning games? Pizza party at Rob Manfred’s!

Such satire-resistant predisposed “social awareness” brings to mind the move made by ESPN after that violent 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville Va.

Weeks later ESPN’s Robert Lee an Asian-American was reassigned from calling a Virginia home football game lest he be confused with Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee rekindling the Charlottesville conflagration not to mention the Civil War.

It worked. Lee dispatched to call the Youngstown State-Pittsburgh game arrived and departed without incident. ESPN had preserved The Union!

Gio latest to throw name behind FanDuel come-on

WFAN morning drive co-host Gregg Giannotti may sell himself as a slick put-down artist and hip professional wise guy but now that he’s heard in FanDuel commercials pitching himself as “Promo Code: Gio” he’s just another shill paid to make saps out of listeners.

Giannotti has joined WFAN teammates in selling FanDuel parlay wagers as good bets a good way to cash big. But parlay bets are fools’ catnip tough to win with lousy payoffs if you win.

Why does Giannotti think he has been ordered to sell parlay bets for the enrichment of listeners or FanDuel? Further WFAN’s owner Entercom invested millions in FanDuel thus Giannotti’s marching order is to create the false sense that beating the house for bundles by betting parlays is easy money.

Again despite all these get-rich-quick young adult-targeting ad campaigns all gambling illegal and legal is predicated on customers losing their money.

As seen on SNY in consecutive losses to the Cubs the Mets now spend more time practicing their home run routines than beating the shift by slapping hits likely doubles and bunt singles the other way. It used to be called “hitting it where they ain’t.”

And the Mets — any team — will always stack runners-left-in-scoring-position numbers until they attack and defeat the obvious. Meanwhile Gary Cohen’s play-by-play will continue to be heard as some version of “Hit right into the shift.”

But that home run skit stuff? Even while losing the Mets clearly have that thing down. Practice makes perfect!

Is it relevant that the Knicks are now winning more than they’re losing when we’re expected to sit through a game such as Tuesday’s on MSG which they won 109-97 in a replica of a kids’ video game? It included 84 3-point heaves in place of basketball.

The Knicks are clearly playing good — or at least far better — team defense. Yet like so many other teams the counter-intuitive has become the intuitive.

Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau NBAE via Getty Images

Good quick firm passes to the inside are seldom followed by quick cuts from the outside to be fed the ball for relatively easy 2’s. Instead the man inside with the ball instinctively next looks to the outside to find an open man to shoot a 3.

This would be easier on the good senses if it were drawn from a mixed bag of surprises and options. For example Play X calls for the man who throws inside to immediately cut to the hoop in search of a return pass leaving two teammates to loiter far outside for 3’s rather than the new-standard 3 lingerers.

Baez will get paid to loaf

Despite what you saw versus the Mets in tight games Wednesday and Thursday — seven swing-like-a-madman strikeouts in eight at-bats jogging to first on a fly ball that should’ve placed him on second when it fell then nearly being tagged out when he walked back toward first — Cubs shortstop Javier Baez since his second season in 2015 hasn’t cared that it’s obvious he doesn’t care.

Yet give him credit. As a free-agent in waiting — waiting for tens of millions more — he’s not trying to fool anyone into thinking he’s something he’s not. He can always be counted on to do the least he can do.

For the most stunning stat of the week we direct your attention to Wednesday’s Rays-Royals in which Kansas City batters struck out just twice! And as if by sheer and irrelevant coincidence the Royals won.

LeBron James Square is currently being graded and paved in Beijing. China’s hardcore Communist leaders have declared that attendance at the dedication ceremonies is mandatory except for those toiling in Nike factories and those guarding pro-democracy “students” at the Nike/Comrade Kaepernick Re-Education Center.

The Nets now wear so many uniforms in so many color combinations that their opponents are easier to ID. Since arriving in Brooklyn the Nets don’t even have a traditional uniform to forsake.

Leave It to Cleavage: This PGA $40 million bonus offering for those who score highest in popularity contests — read: are considered good for TV ratings — is clearly an act of systemic sexism.

Otherwise Paige Spiranac a consistent “standout” despite her unseen ability to actually play pro golf would be a lock for a healthy share based on her attention-generating presence.

Until this sudden rush to bolt through NCAA loopholes I thought a “transfer portal” was where they housed those about to be deported.

For visionary genius you can’t beat the Yankees. By hideously over-pricing the better-to-best seats they’ve been practicing social distancing since the new Stadium opened in 2009.

From helicopters to tanks and airplanes everything is on the table as the U.S. is aiming for military superiority in the years to come.

Take the M2 Bradley  the infantry fighting vehicle that has been in service since 1981. Although it proved itself time and time again on the world’s battlefields it’s getting old enough that no amount of upgrades can keep it relevant indefinitely.That is why the U.S. Army launched in 2017 the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program. It covers a number of new machines and in the case of the Bradley a replacement called Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV).There are two prototypes presently being tested for the OMFV the Rheinmetall-made Lynx KF41 and General Dynamics’ Griffin III. In the case of the former development just got a boost in mid-April.It was then when Rheinmetall announced it selected L3Harris to develop the vehicle’s mission cybersecurity and its modular open systems approach.“We are excited to have L3Harris join our growing team to support the U.S. Army’s OMFV program” said in a statement Mathew Warnick Managing Director for American Rheinmetall Vehicles.“Their experience in open architecture communications and cybersecurity bring tremendous capability to the American Rheinmetall Vehicles team as we prepare our digitally engineered OMFV to provide our Soldiers overmatch now and for the future.”The Lynx is a tracked armored vehicle equipped with autocannons light machine guns and grenade launchers. Its engine is capable of developing 750 hp and gives the thing a top speed of 70 kph (43 mph).But that’s just one configuration and because it is modular it can be transformed in anything from ambulance to infantry fighting vehicle. Rheinmetall plans two versions of it one weighing up to 38 tons and capable of seating up to six soldiers and a slightly larger one that can carry eight.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Halsey and Khalid already pulled the plug on their Summerfest 2021 headliner shows earlier this year. Now Santana and Earth Wind & Fire have pushed their 30-date “Miraculous Supernatural” North American tour to 2022.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Famers were supposed to tour last summer before the COVID-19 pandemic forced nearly every artist to get off the road. The American Family Insurance Amphitheater stop had been scheduled for the night before the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee which also never materialized.

The Milwaukee stop was rescheduled for July 11 2021. But with the tour pushed off yet another year Santana and Earth Wind and Fire will now play the Milwaukee amphitheater on July 10 2022.

Refunds are available through the point of purchase until May 23. Previously purchased tickets will be honored.

Aside from some drive-in concerts and socially distant gigs the pandemic has grounded the live music industry for 13 months. And some big artists with scheduled Milwaukee-area shows including Kenny Chesney Roger Waters and Rage Against The Machine pushed their tours back again to 2022.

Some shows still on summer calendar

But with every American adult now eligible for vaccines some artists forced to stay home in 2020 are planning to play Milwaukee this year.

The American Family Insurance Amphitheater which completed a $51.3 million renovation last year has four shows still scheduled in August and September outside of Summerfest with the Black Crowes Maroon 5 Hall & Oates and KISS with David Lee Roth.

Summerfest itself forced to cancel for the first time in its 53-year history last year is scheduled for Sept. 2 to 4 9 to 11 and 16 to 18.

Dave Matthews Band originally booked for Summerfest 2020 will play the American Family Insurance Amphitheater for the festival on Sept. 15. Five other previously announced Summerfest amphitheater headliners booked for 2020 — Justin Bieber Guns N' Roses Chris Stapleton Luke Bryan and Blink-182 — have yet to announce if they'll play Summerfest in September or next year or cancel their appearances completely like Halsey did in January and Khalid did this month.

Some scrapped 2020 shows for Fiserv Forum are scheduled for this August through October including Joe Rogan Alan Jackson Michael Bublé Dan + Shay and Tame Impala.

And some brand-new shows have been announced for this year with Widespread Panic (Oct. 21-24 at the Riverside Theater) Mt. Joy and Trampled by Turtles (Summerfest's BMO Harris Pavilion Sept. 24) and Andrea Bocelli (Fiserv Forum on Oct. 13).

Summerfest to announce headliners

Summerfest is expected to announce new headliners for September and four standalone shows that have yet to be announced are on the books this year for its 5000-seat BMO Harris Pavilion according to Summerfest parent company Milwaukee World Festival Inc.'s tentative calendar of events.

Don Smiley president and CEO of Milwaukee World Festival has told the Journal Sentinel that reduced-capacity concerts are generally not financially viable. But new safety protocols may be in place for an anticipated concerts comeback such as mask requirements vaccine passports and rapid COVID testing. Summerfest and industry leaders like Live Nation and AEG have yet to announce any new criteria.

Some final tweaks would make it great.,"Desert Sun Editorial Board

Riverside County planning commissioners and supervisors will soon be deciding whether to approve an 11000-seat $250 million privately financed sports and events arena on unincorporated land along Interstate 10 near Palm Desert.

On balance we think this project would be a benefit to the Coachella Valley — if developers live up to pledges to reduce its environmental impact and if local leaders ensure that taxpayers especially in Palm Desert aren’t stuck with unforeseen public safety costs.

The arena would bring a variety of new entertainment offerings to the Coachella Valley for the benefit of both residents and visitors. The project’s developers the Oak View Group plan to make the arena the home of an American Hockey League team affiliated with the National Hockey League’s Seattle Kraken. In addition OVG plans to work with Live Nation a massive live entertainment company to bring performing artists to the venue.

Because the arena would be year-round it would help bolster the desert’s tourism economy —particularly in the hot summer months. And the size of the arena means it could attract top acts who now might favor Las Vegas or Los Angeles. We also like that the developers plan to make the ice rink facilities available to local ice skating and ice hockey enthusiasts who last year lost their only local rink when the Desert Ice Castle in Cathedral City closed for good.

The projected economic impact of the arena is not massive but not inconsequential. Oak View Group paid for a study that predicts an initial $200 million economic impact and a $32 million ongoing annual economic impact.

By comparison a 2017 study by the Greater Palm Springs Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells— which attracts close to 500000 spectators — has a local economic impact of over $400 million a year.

A 2016 study conducted by Development Management Group Inc on the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival which averages around 540000 attendees for its pair of three-day weekend concerts estimated that the event brings around $600 million to the local economy.

Still construction would provide temporary employment for approximately 1400 people. Once built it is estimated the arena would support 420 more part- and full-time jobs — mostly rather low-paid jobs for ushers ticket sales concession workers and security. OVG’s CEO Tim Leiweke told this board he expects that three-quarters of the construction jobs to be union jobs and that three-quarters of the operating staff will be local.

Unlike many sports arenas across the United States OVG is not asking for tax breaks or special bonds to get this project done. That gives it a leg up in our opinion.

Because OVG and the Berger Foundation — which owns the land on which the arena would be built — would be fully invested with their own money in this project this puts the burden on them to ensure it is a successful venture that operates profitably for decades to come. To us that seems to reduce the chances that the project will turn into a white elephant with taxpayers left holding the bag.

The arena will also generate tax revenue for the county — something that wasn’t going to be possible if the project had been built on tribal land in Palm Springs as originally proposed.

That said OVG’s initial plans to minimize the environmental impact of this project don’t cut it — yet.

The company is currently building what it touts as the first carbon-neutral arena in Seattle. However for the Coachella Valley project it proposed getting just 20% of electricity from renewable sources. And it has virtually no plans for public transit to the arena.

This is unacceptable given that air quality in the Coachella Valley is poor and getting worse — thanks to smog blowing in from the L.A. area the rapidly drying Salton Sea agricultural activities wildfires climate change and our own home-grown traffic. Protecting our blue skies is not only essential for our health it’s a necessity to maintain the appeal of the Coachella Valley as a tourist attraction.

In a meeting with this editorial board Leiweke admitted the company needed to do better. He pledged to “double down” on solar use less water and find ways to recycle more of the water that is used. He also said he would take lessons learned at the Seattle arena and apply them here — pledging for example to eliminate single-use plastics at the arena within the first year.

Leiweke said more detailed plans to “green” the arena would be released soon; we want county officials to hold OVG to that. We also hope county authorities can use whatever clout they can muster with the Imperial Irrigation District to make as much solar power as possible feasible for the arena project.

In a similar vein county officials have the chance to use the arena project as a catalyst for improved public transit in the region. This could mean clean-powered busses or shuttles from local hotels. Carpooling and ride-sharing should be encouraged — and incentivized financially. Dare we hope that Amtrak’s proposed L.A.-to-Phoenix train could somehow stop nearby maybe in 2050?

A robust public transit plan could not only curb the air-pollution impact of the arena but also reduce traffic that neighbors and public officials in Palm Desert are concerned about.

We are reasonably convinced that OVG’s plans to manage the expected congestion are sufficient. If they are not Leiweke is no dummy — he knows no one is going to come back to his arena repeatedly if they’re stuck in a parking lot for an hour waiting to get on I-10.

Palm Desert officials are worried that the arena could create direct and indirect burdens of millions of dollars a year on its fire and police resources (contracted from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department). OVG disputes this. County authorities need to weigh in here.

If county planners agree with OVG that for example a new fire station would not be necessary to support the arena the county will need to be prepared to act if their estimations are wrong once the project is built. Perhaps some of the tax revenue generated by the project could be held in reserve to deal with such needs if they do arise.

Overall we believe the issues around this project can be resolved to the satisfaction of most people. This arena would create jobs diversify the desert’s entertainment offerings generate tax revenue and be a higher use for this parcel than the previously envisioned business park.

Any community can have a business park. Few get the opportunity to have a venue of this caliber. Turning down an opportunity like this could give developers an impression that our valley is not welcoming to capital projects related to economic development.

Let’s work to make the arena the best it can be — and let’s not let this opportunity slip through our fingers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNDI2MjMyL0VsdmlzLVByZXNsZXktR3JhY2VsYW5kLXVwc3RhaXJzLUVsdmlzLW9mZmljZS1kZXNr0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzcy5jby51ay9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzE0MjYyMzIvRWx2aXMtUHJlc2xleS1HcmFjZWxhbmQtdXBzdGFpcnMtRWx2aXMtb2ZmaWNlLWRlc2svYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elvis Presley: The piece of Graceland's upstairs that’s been brought down for fans to see,"Graceland: Take a live virtual tour of Elvis' Memphis home

When Elvis Presley first moved into Graceland in 1957 he had an open house policy for the Memphis Mafia to come and go as they pleased. However the upstairs was his private space and he installed a privacy wall on the landing with a couple of one-way mirrors. In 1982 some five years after his death the Memphis mansion opened for tours but to this day The King’s daughter Lisa Marie keeps Graceland’s upstairs off-limits.

Graceland’s upstairs features a number of rooms but most notable are Elvis Presley’s bedroom and office. Now interestingly a piece of his workspace has been brought downstairs for fans to see to this day. On display behind glass in the mansion’s trophy room is Elvis’ personal office desk. Graceland archivist Angie Marchese shared some facts about the unique item during a recent virtual live tour that Express.co.uk took part in.

On April 24 1976 Paul and Linda visited John and Yoko at their New York home at The Dakota on the corner of 72nd Street and Central Park West. The night became famous not just because it was the last time the Beatles stars would ever see each other but also because they were watching Saturday Night Live. The show's producer had made them an extraordinary offer on air as a joke - not knowing they would actually be enjoying the show together a few blocks away from the studio. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH THE LEGENDARY SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE BEATLES SEGMENT

John lived at the Dakota from 1973 until the night of his death on December 8 1980. In the spring of 1976 Paul was about to start a US tour with his band Wings and kept ""popping over"" to see his former bandmate. That particular night John introduced him to the hit show Saturday Night Live. He told Paul that the producer Lorne Michaels had declared his love for The Beatles and made a public offer live on air. He said: ""In my book The Beatles are the best thing that ever happened to music. It goes even deeper than that — you’re not just a musical group you’re a part of us. We grew up with you.""

Almost overnight the prime contractor with about 23000 employees switched from its traditional in-person approach to virtual recruitment interviewing and training.

SpaceNews correspondent Debra Werner spoke with Lockheed Martin Space executives Nick Spain human resources vice president Renu Aggarwal talent acquisition director and Heather Erickson organizational development director about the opportunities and challenges posed by heightened demand for talent amid a pandemic.

How do you find new employees?

Nick Spain: I have a phenomenal staff. We have folks that think about college hiring building relationships with schools. We partner with universities and two-year schools. We have programs in place for military hiring. We also have a pretty robust STEM program. We’re making sure that we’re giving people opportunities whether internships or Co-Ops. Another thing we do is partner with our headquarters to make sure we’re searching for executive talent that we need.

What types of relationships do you have with schools?

Nick Spain: We’ve got our software associate degree program. We’ve got our advanced manufacturing technician apprenticeship program. From the corporate standpoint we partner with minority-serving institutions and historically Black colleges and universities. For example I’m an executive sponsor for Lockheed Martin with Hampton University. We help the schools with curriculum to make sure that students are prepared for the working world. We do workshops to help them whether it’s to get ready for interviews or to understand what it’s like at work. We also make sure that we provide people with opportunities and training so they will be successful once they get here. We make sure we’re building long-term partnerships.

Heather Erickson: I would add that we focus on upskilling our workforce. We have a comprehensive tuition reimbursement program. If folks are trying to expand their education we have practices and policies to support that continuing education whether it be a full degree or just a single course.

Do you have strong demand for workers with clearances and do you help workers obtain clearances?

Nick Spain: We do hire a lot of cleared individuals. We also have those that go through the clearance process while they’re working for us. They may do unclassified work while waiting for their clearance. That is a large portion of our Lockheed Martin Space workforce.

How did the pandemic change the hiring process?

Renu Aggarwal: It was a pretty big shift. We were an organization where interviews were done in person. We did over 6000 interviews virtually last year. From a recruiting standpoint we kept moving forward. We also held to our college hiring commitments. A lot of them worked virtually and were successful.

Is there an emphasis on diversity?

Nick Spain: Yes. That’s definitely been long standing. We believe that’s a business imperative. The best teams have diversity of people diversity of thought. That’s why we build the right relationship whether that be minority-serving institutions or organizations that serve more experienced professionals. We make sure that we have a presence at the conferences. We’re building that into our overall plan. We have a chief diversity officer for the corporation as well as a vice president of global diversity and inclusion to give it extra emphasis. We built it into our hiring and promotion practices.

Liftoff of the powerhouse hydrogen-fueled launcher is set for 1:46 p.m. PDT (4:46 p.m. EDT; 2046 GMT) from Vandenberg Air Force Base California. There is a 40% chance of favorable weather for Monday’s launch opportunity according to the official launch forecast issued by the U.S. Space Force.

The weather concerns Monday include surface winds cumulus clouds thick clouds and precipitation. The exact duration of the launch window Monday has not been disclosed. The NRO said earlier this month the mission’s launch period extended from 12:39-3:57 p.m. PDT (3:39-6:57 p.m. EDT; 1939-2257 GMT).

If the launch is scrubbed Monday there is also a 40% chance of acceptable conditions for liftoff Tuesday.

ULA a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin has four Delta 4-Heavy rockets left to launch in the next few years. All are assigned to haul top secret satellites into space for the National Reconnaissance Office which owns the U.S. government’s fleet of orbiting spy platforms.

The rest of the Delta rocket family including the single-core Delta 4-Medium has been retired as ULA transitions to the next-generation Vulcan Centaur rocket. The Delta 4-Heavy created by joining there Delta 4 common booster cores together is tailored for carrying the U.S. government’s largest intelligence-gathering spacecraft into orbit.

The next Delta 4-Heavy launch designated NROL-82 will blast off from Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg a picturesque location overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It will be the 42nd flight of a Delta 4 rocket since 2002 and the 13th launch of the Delta 4-Heavy configuration.

The NROL-82 mission will be ULA’s first launch of 2021. If the rest of ULA’s launch schedule remains on track the company could conduct as many as 10 missions before the end of December but the majority of the flights aren’t expected to take off until the second half of the year.

While government officials have not disclosed any information about the payload riding on the NROL-82 mission independent analysts believe the Delta 4-Heavy rocket will likely deliver the NRO’s next KH-11 optical reconnaissance satellite to orbit. The KH-11 satellites are about the size of a bus fitted with large telescopes pointing down at Earth to collect unmatched high-resolution images of strategic locations around the world for analysis by U.S. intelligence agencies.

Often called “Keyhole” satellites he KH-11 spacecraft require the heavy-lifting capability of the Delta 4-Heavy along with the rocket’s voluminous payload shroud. All of the Delta 4-Heavy missions from Vandenberg have carried KH-11 satellites to space. The exact imaging capabilities of the KH-11 satellites are top secret and the NRO does not publicly identify the types of spacecraft on each of its launches.

Information about the Delta 4-Heavy rocket’s post-launch trajectory released by ULA and published in open navigational warnings indicate the launcher will head slightly west of due south from Vandenberg according to Marco Langbroek a Dutch archaeologist and an expert in the orbits of military satellites.

The ground track suggests the Delta 4-Heavy will place its cargo into a sun-synchronous polar orbit with an inclination of about 98 degrees to the equator Langbroek wrote on his website.

The timing of the launch Monday closely aligns with the orbital plane of a KH-11 satellite launched in January 2011 aboard a previous Delta 4-Heavy mission. The new satellite might be a replacement for that 10-year-old spacecraft.

The NRO has at least three active KH-11 satellites launched in 2005 2011 and 2013 all flying in the same type of sun-synchronous orbit. The most recent Delta 4-Heavy launch from Vandenberg in 2019 deployed its NRO spy satellite cargo into a different orbit raising questions whether it carried a KH-11 satellite or another kind of clandestine spacecraft.

Ted Molczan an experienced satellite tracker in Canada agreed with Langbroek’s assessment that the NROL-82 mission will haul a KH-11-type satellite into space.

In 2019 former President Donald Trump tweeted a declassified image widely believed to be from a KH-11 satellite showing damage on an Iranian launch pad after a rocket explosion. Using sun angles civilian sleuths estimated the time the picture was taken then cross-checked the time with the known positions of NRO spy satellites.

ULA raised the Delta 4-Heavy rocket on the SLC-6 launch pad in February. Since then the launch team completed a “wet dress rehearsal” in which they loaded the Delta 4-Heavy with cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

Ground crews installed the NROL-82 mission’s secret payload on top of the Delta 4-Heavy earlier this month the final element to complete stacking of the 233-foot-tall (71-meter) rocket.

The NROL-82 mission will be the ninth Delta 4 mission to depart from the SLC-6 launch pad a facility once designed to host space shuttle launches on the West Coast. When NASA abandoned plans to fly space shuttles from California after the Challenger accident the launch pad languished until Boeing became next long-term tenant to enable Delta 4 launches.

Boeing merged its Delta rocket program with Lockheed Martin’s Atlas 5 program in 2006 to create ULA.

Like all launches for the National Reconnaissance Office the final phase of the Delta 4-Heavy mission Monday will occur out of public view. The NRO typically orders news blackouts and officials launch broadcasts conclude a few minutes after liftoff.

The Delta 4-Heavy rocket’s three Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-68A main engines will drive the launcher off the planet with 2.1 million pounds of thrust equivalent to 51 million horsepower.

Heading south over the Pacific the rocket will surpass the speed of sound at T+plus 1 minute 23 seconds.

The core engine of the triple-body rocket will run at a partial thrust setting for the first few minutes of the flight to save propellant. The side boosters will consume their fuel and shut down their engines at T+plus 3 minutes 56 seconds. The boosters will jettison two seconds later to fall into the Pacific Ocean.

The core RS-68A engine will throttle up to full power and burn until T+plus 5 minutes 37 seconds. Stage separation is scheduled for T+plus 5 minutes 44 seconds followed by ignition of the second stage’s Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 engine at T+plus 5 minutes 56 seconds.

The Delta 4-Heavy’s payload fairing will jettison at T+plus 6 minutes 7 seconds and ULA’s launch broadcast will conclude moments later. ULA and the NRO are expected to confirm the outcome of the rest of the mission on social media and in press releases later Monday afternoon.

Assuming the Delta 4-Heavy is carrying a KH-11 spysat the rocket’s upper stage is expected to target an elongated orbit ranging as high as 620 miles (1000 kilometers) in altitude.

After Monday’s launch ULA will have one more Delta 4-Heavy launch left in its backlog from Vandenberg. The other two Delta 4-Heavy missions left to launch will blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Florida.

It is no secret that the Israeli Air Force considers the combat range as one of the most important factors when adopting a new fighter aircraft and that because of this it was the first operator to ask for external fuel tanks for the F-35 Lightning II or more specifically for the customized F-35I Adir. The first studies for new fuel tanks started at least during the system design and development phase (SDD) of the 5th gen aircraft but after 2019 nothing new surfaced at least online. Until a few days ago the Israeli news website Walla reported that development is still ongoing.

According to Walla the Israeli Air Force Flight Testing Center (FTC) at Tel-Nof AFB is developing the external drop tanks that will help the Adir to complete long-range missions over “third circle” targets such a hypothetical strike against Iranian objectives without the need for aerial refueling while also allowing an extended time on station (TOS) over the targets. The report mentions also significant progress in the integration of Israel-made missiles on the F-35I.

Before moving on here is a brief explanation of the “third circle” from the Times of Israel: “The “third circle” refers to the three levels of direct threats facing Israel the first being small terror groups on Israel’s borders like Hamas; the second being larger threats like the Syrian army and Hezbollah; and the third being countries that do not share a border with Israel like Iran and Iraq.”

The development of the new fuel tank is the result of the collaboration of Israel’s Ministry of Defense Air Force and defense industries that aims to upgrade the strategic capabilities of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) against “third circle” countries. This process is quite delicate as the new external fuel tanks need to not degrade too much the low observability of the F-35 and this can be done mainly through the shape and materials chosen.

Also a detachable tank should include some measures to mitigate the effects that its pylon’s attachment points would have on the low observability after the tanks are jettisoned once emptied before reaching the target. In fact even though the tanks and their pylons are dropped the attachment points and fuel lines would not be covered by any Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) and possibly expose the Adir to unwanted radar reflections.

IDF sources mentioned by Walla in their report said that the development and production process of the new external fuel tanks for the F-35I Adir will not exceed two years. The first reports about the ongoing planning and initial development process were published by Aviation Week in 2019 when Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Cyclone a subsidiary of Elbit Systems completed the initial design studies on both a conformal fuel tank (CFT) design and a 600-gallon drop tank respectively.

The F-35A from whom the F-35I was developed has an internal fuel tank capacity of slightly less than 18500 lb (8391 kg the exact amount varies depending on the source) and a non-classified range and combat radius in excess of 1187 nm (2200 km) and 594 nm (1100 km) respectively. The fuel is contained in several tanks inside the wings and fuselage to preserve the stealth profile. With the two 600-gallon drop tanks under its wings the F-35I would increase its total fuel capacity by approximately 40% as each tank would add about 4000 lb of fuel for a total of more than 26500 lb.

It is not known how the new external fuel tanks will be shaped. During the SDD phase the F-35 was expected to use the U.S. Navy’s standard 480-gallon tanks already operational on the F/A-18. However wind tunnel testing showed that the standard tanks would create dangerous store release conditions with the released weapons possibly striking the aircraft. With the heavy use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling different designs were tested and a safer aero-shaped 426-gallon tank was ultimately approved for the F-35 but it didn’t make it into the production stage

According to some sources the Israeli Air Force inquired if it was possible to adapt the 600-gallon external fuel tanks of the F-22 Raptor to be used also by the F-35. And here comes again the shape problem: the F-22 uses the drop tanks only for ferry flights or flight without external air-to-ground ordnance (which is carried only internally); if the F-35 Adir was to use the drop tanks only without external weapons the Raptor’s drop tanks might be feasible but if the Israelis want to use also the fuel tanks with the Adir for combat missions or in “Beast mode” and heavy external weapons a tank redesign might be needed as happened during the SDD.

If the 600-gallon fuel tanks become operational with the Adir the IDF would have the capability to use the F-35 in long-range strikes against Iran in a similar fashion as the famous Operation Opera with heavy loaded aircraft departing Israel fully packed with fuel and dropping the external tanks once empty arriving on target with a clean aircraft and minimal degradation of the low observability. Also this would allow the IDF to safely use their limited number of tankers without having to put them at risk near hostile airspace.

According to The Warzone Lockheed Martin is also now considering working to certify a 600-gallon drop tank design for all F-35As possibly to be used also in conjunction with the “Beast mode”. Even for a country like the United States that does not lack tankers the addition of new drop tanks to the F-35’s stores would be a much-welcomed option to reduce the reliance on the tankers during long-range missions in new theaters like the Pacific Ocean.

In a hypothetical conflict in the South China Sea the F-35s might not be able to get inland far enough to hit their targets while leaving the tankers at a safe distance after the last of multiple refuels on their way in with obvious downsides other than the reduced range and the higher “bingo fuel” required to safely reach again a friendly airport to land.

This problematic reliance on the tankers was notable in a recent exercise earlier this month when four F-16CM Block 50 of the 35th Fighter Wing based at Misawa Air Base Japan flew all the way to the South China Sea to perform an overflight of the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) aircraft carrier. For this mission four KC-135 Stratotankers were required with an unspecified number of air-to-air refuelings along the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L3doeS1pcy1sb2NraGVlZC1oaXJpbmctYW4tdW5rbm93bi1jb21wYW55LXRvLWxhdW5jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Is Lockheed Hiring an Unknown Company to Launch 26 Rockets?,"ABL Space aims to compete in the small rocket launch market -- but has never actually launched a rocket.

As one half of the ""United Launch Alliance"" team Lockheed Martin (LMT -0.17%) (along with its partner Boeing) forms the backbone of the U.S. government's space program.

True upstart SpaceX is increasingly growing into a real alternative to the Lockheed-Boeing alliance for many missions. But when the Air Force or NASA absolutely positively has to get a satellite into orbit successfully they know that they can still rely on ULA's record of 142 straight successful rocket launches to get them there.

Which is precisely why it's so surprising to learn that earlier this month Lockheed Martin announced that it's subcontracting some of its space launch work to an almost entirely unknown rocket company.

Introducing ABL Space Systems

ABL Space Systems is the name of this new arrival and ""high-cadence no-fuss ... 100% American Made"" rockets are its game.

As the company's website describes ABL is developing a two-stage RS1 launch vehicle capable of lifting 1350 kilograms of payload to Low Earth Orbit and a GS0 deployable launch system to launch it. Essentially a spaceport-in-a-box GS0 -- like the RS1 it launches -- can be delivered to almost any location with a big enough ""concrete pad"" to host it moving on the back of tractor-trailer trucks then setting up and launching off. To begin with ABL plans to conduct its launches from established spaceports at Vandenberg Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral (of course) and also from Wallops Island in Virginia Kodiak spaceport in Alaska and Camden County Georgia.

GS0 has not been used in any actual orbital launches yet however nor has RS1 ever yet visited space.

But you gotta have faith

Nevertheless Lockheed announced this month that it has hired ABL to provide it with ""up to"" 26 RS1 rockets through 2025 and then ""up to"" an additional 32 launches through 2029. It's a sizable order -- worth up to $700 million at ABL's stated launch cost. Lockheed also dropped a strong hint that it is interested in forging a ""strategic partnership"" with ABL over the long term. But why is Lockheed throwing its weight behind an unproven design in the first place?

I have to figure that cost is one reason. Although the prices of large rocket launches by ULA have been falling -- in a notable pair of launch contracts awarded to ULA last month the company charged barely $112 million each -- ABL is advertising its launches for a mere $12 million per mission. That translates to a mere $8888 per kilogram to Low Earth Orbit and represents a 36% cost savings on the per-kilogram cost of launching a base model Atlas V rocket at Lockheed-owned ULA.

So in addition to the advantages ABL is advertising in terms of launch flexibility and in addition to giving Lockheed Martin an entirely new tool in its tool chest -- a rocket tailored to launch smaller payloads -- it also gives the company a new means of competing with SpaceX on price.

Follow the money

And there's a third reason for Lockheed Martin to be interested in helping ABL succeed. As it turns out Lockheed Martin owns an interest in ABL.

In July 2019 ABL announced that Lockheed Martin Ventures had made a ""strategic investment"" of unstated size in the small rocket company. (ABL itself says Lockheed is one of its 10 biggest backers.) At the time if you recall the U.S. Pentagon was pushing a concept dubbed alternately ""responsive"" ""on demand"" or ""flexible"" launch supporting small rocket launchers who could promise to deliver small payloads to orbit on short notice and from launch sites set up at short notice. Presumably Lockheed's investment in ABL was a move to position the company to meet the Pentagon's needs in this regard.

To an extent therefore Lockheed's awarding of a big launch contract to ABL can be viewed as a way of preserving its own investment in the company and preserving its ability to meet future Pentagon responsive launch needs. It's also an investment that could see a quick return in other markets because in February 2021 Lockheed contracted ABL to run Lockheed's ""first U.K. vertical satellite launch"" in 2022 a mission dubbed ""U.K. Pathfinder.""

On Thursday two Democratic Congressmen expressed their lack of support for increasing the number of F-35s in Biden’s budget unless the program overcomes its shortcomings.

The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is an American fifth-generation single-engine all-weather stealth multirole fighter jet. Considered the most technologically advanced airplane ever built it combines high-end stealth with unmatched situational awareness. Supported by advanced data capturing and a robust communication suite it can conduct mission operations electronically.

However despite its advanced stealth features the American F-35 could be detected by the radars of the Russian S-400 air defense systems according to some experts. This is believed to be one of the reasons why the US has slapped sanctions on its NATO ally Turkey for the latter’s S-400 deal with Russia.

Washington also indicated its displeasure after New Delhi had in October 2018 inked a deal with Moscow for the weapon system.

F-35 Hits US Congress Hurdles

Rep. Donald Norcross from New Jersey who chairs the Armed Services Committee’s tactical air and land subcommittee mentioned the unaffordability of the project which often goes beyond the allocated budget. He threatened to shift investment to a more affordable program.

Rep. John Garamendi from California who leads the readiness subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) talked about how the program “fails to deliver on promised capabilities.”

Concurrently the Department of Defense (DoD) announced a “strategic pause” on its efforts to develop its new logistical system Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN) for the F-35 program due to a lack of funding.

Even Republican lawmakers have raised their concerns about the program’s drawbacks. Last year the US Congress agreed to 17 additional jets.

USAF Flagged Concerns Too

The change of attitude among lawmakers during the joint hearing of HASC’s readiness and tactical air subcommittees might be linked to Air Force chief of staff General Charles Q. Brown’s public admission on the program’s shortcoming in February.

Brown had tried to justify F-35’s low-level capabilities by comparing it to a Ferrari. He said the vehicle is a high-end device that cannot be used for everyday purposes.

This runs counter to what had been projected by DoD and Lockheed-Martin for years. They had described F-35 as an affordable flexible multi-role aircraft that can replace several older models such as the F-22 Raptor (despite lacking the high-end combat capabilities of the Raptor) and the A-10 Warthog.

But F-35 has not lived up to the hype and now Brown has suggested the replacement of the oldest F-16s in service with a (yet to be developed) less expensive non-stealthy advanced fourth-generation fighter jet rather than F-35s.

The F-35’s long laundry of problems includes logistical issues pilot blackouts spare parts shortages premature part failures software development disasters gun use cracking the plane and the need for frequent tanker support. The project constantly runs behind schedule with recurrent delays.

According to Extreme Tech the F-35’s mission capable rate is 69% below the mandated 80%. Only 36% of the F-35 fleet is available for any required mission way below the required 50% standard.

US’ Costliest Weapons Program

What had been projected as the most affordable aircraft program has now become the world’s most expensive weapons platform because of the vast number of upgrades and enhancements it had to undergo over time. The Eurasian Times reported that flying the F-35 currently costs $36000 per hour and the lifetime cost might come up to $1.7 trillion.

A simulated war game last year aimed at a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan pointed out the practical flaws of the F-35. The hypothetical air raid relied more on futuristic technologies rather than on F-35 jets.

Yet the F-35s are probably still better in comparison to its competition. The Russian Su-57 won’t have second-generation engines till 2022. The Eurasian Times had reported earlier that the Su-57’s stealth factor has been compromised by its design.

India has also questioned whether it should buy F-35s. The main issue will be compatibility and affordability. The F-35’s use of the most advanced radio communications equipment renders it incompatible with India’s Russian-origin communication suites. For its current operations the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) is best suited for India."

Keanu Reeves is renowned for being an absolute angel. Despite that it seems he's not afraid of outing people - especially when it comes to nabbing his girlfriends or at least trying to.

That's what the 56-year-old Matrix actor claims Parks and Recreation's star Rob Lowe attempted to do but luckily (for Keanu) they 'saw through him'.

PA

The pair worked together back when filming for 1986 film Youngblood was happening and formed a friendship.

Advert

In his biography he wrote: ""He's all right. We hung out for a while but all he did was try to steal my girlfriends. He almost had his wicked way with two of them but eventually they saw through him.""

Lowe may have had a girlfriend at the time but that wouldn't have stopped him going for other women with him previously speaking about his unfaithful past.

The 57-year-old who married his wife Sheryl Berkoff in 1991 says the relationship was his first 'attempt' at monogamy which wasn't 'in his nature at the time' and something he says he was unable to do.

Advert

He told Haute Living magazine: ""It made me examine how I was living.""

From there Lowe ended up entering rehab in the late 90s for alcohol and sex addictions and believes sobriety stopped him being unfaithful.

PA

Rather bizarrely last year it emerged that Rob's wife taught Gwyneth Paltrow how to perform oral sex when she was a teenager.

Advert

Paltrow made the confession on Lowe's podcast Literally! With Rob Lowe where she was explaining how she and his wife connected.

She noted how the pair met when she was 15 or 16 while Sheryl was working as a make up artist on Gwyneth's mum's TV movie.

She said: ""I met Sheryl and I was like immediately obsessed with her. First of all she was dating Keanu Reeves who was my celebrity crush. And she was so cool.

""She knew that I was sneaking cigarettes and she would come smoke with me behind the trailer. And she taught me how to give a blow job and you know all the classic Sheryl stuff.

Advert

""And I just worshipped her. I thought she was literally the coolest chick of all time. And she was so awesome to me.

""And I was a high school kid. Like the fact that she loved me that much before I was anyone or anything you know? Same with you.""

Gilbert says Lowe was “a horny young man.”

Little House on the Prairie star Melissa Gilbert and Rob Lowe used to be romantically involved when they were both young actors. Gilbert says Lowe was quite a character back then and she describes him in her book as “a horny young man.” Here’s why.

Gilbert and Lowe met while she was at a taping of The Dinah Shore Show. In her book Prairie Tale she says Lowe waited in the hallway in the hopes of bumping into her. According to Gilbert Lowe placed a script under his arm so she would know he was an actor.

Apparently Lowe didn’t need to tuck a script under his arm to be noticed. He caught Gilbert’s eye. She described him as “cute sweet and funny.” She goes one step further and says he was so attractive that he was “almost pretty.”

Lowe and Gilbert eventually got in touch and went on their first date. Gilbert says she fell for him almost right away. She doesn’t remember much about what they did on their date but she does remember how she felt when she was around him.

“All I remember is that I felt like I got hit in the head with a brick” wrote Gilbert. “I fell instantly hopelessly and stupidly in love.”

Rob Lowe was ‘a horny young man’ according to Melissa Gilbert

One thing Gilbert remembers about her time with Lowe was that he had a high sex drive. In Prairie Tale she says she agreed with the late director Tony Richardson’s assessment that Lowe was “horny.” She also says he enjoyed it when young women would visit him on the sets of his movies. Gilbert describes the time he was on a movie set and he opened the door of his dressing room giving the ladies a peek at his naked body.

According to Gilbert he gave the young women a “full frontal flash” when he opened the door so he could ask his wardrobe coordinator where his clothes were. Gilbert says the police had to be called so that they could clear the dressing room.

Gilbert says the late Joel Schumacher who directed Lowe in the film St. Elmo’s Fire affectionately described him as “the shameless creature.” The Little House on the Prairie star says his assessment was honest funny and true. She says Lowe didn’t have any shame when it came to admiring himself or allowing others to admire him.

Melissa Gilbert on her sex life with Rob Lowe

Gilbert also wrote about being intimate with Lowe. They had sex soon after they started dating. She described being “hungry” for Lowe saying she wanted him so badly that she felt like she wanted to “bite him.”

According to the Laura Ingalls actor their time together was intense. Gilbert says Lowe “wouldn’t let” her close her eyes during sex. He preferred for her to have her eyes wide open.

Talking about how the collaboration the only one on the album aside from the bonus track ‘Fullmoon Lullaby’ with Wednesday Campanella on the Japanese version of the album Porter Robinson explains:

On this particular track this is one of the only collaborations on the album it’s together with T Orlando Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs. And he was really instrumental in so many aspects of this song. One thing that he really helped me do was we would come up with this vibe we’re sitting in the studio in LA and this was early early days when I was still really questioning whether or not I would actually be able to make another Porter album. And just really being my own harshest critic and feeling like nothing I did was good enough all the stuff. So I thought like “I just have to try something. So let me try working with some other people.” So I tested it out with a few different collaborations. I was a huge fan of the two tracks that TEED released in 2018 “Don’t You Forget About Me” and “Leave a Light On.” “Don’t You Forget About Me” still makes me cry. Unbelievable. And that was what I found in the studio is we started this idea for Unfold and he brought up to me how much he loved my song “Sea of Voices” from the previous album. And it was an interesting reference for me to hear because I felt ‘Worlds’ was this thing that was supposed to be so far away this fictional dreamscape that you escape to. And I knew I wanted ‘Nurture’ to be this thing that was this love letter to reality because that was what I needed. I needed some convincing I think that the world was truly beautiful and that living was truly something worthwhile. […] So anyways TEED is talking about “Sea of Voices” to me which is an influence that was feeling far off at that point but it got me started because I was like “Oh he likes something I did. I know how to do that.” And I’m starting to put together some choruses stuff like that. This is what the collaborations did for me. It was people in the studio going “You’re crazy. Why do you want to try something new now? What you have right here is amazing.” And I would be like “Oh it is? Oh cool. Well then I can relax.” And I remember a moment with TEED where I was just like “Dude I don’t know about this. It’s cool I think we can come up with something a little more special.” It was like if you’re a little bit drunk and somebody hits you with ice water in the face. They’re like “Dude sober up.” He was like “This is really great. Just sit down on the chair and keep producing for another hour and see what happens.”

Throughout the interview he also details how he had chance to refine ‘Nurture’ during the pandemic explaining that ‘the album was supposed to be out ages ago’. Throughout the album specifically in tracks ‘Musician’ and ‘Mirror’ he handles the themes of criticism and battling insecurities topics in which are also touched on in the interview with Zane Lowe.

Who is it?

Keanu Reeves is regarded as one of the nicest celebrities in the entertainment industry. But once you try to steal one of his girlfriends he won’t be afraid to expose you. And when Parks and Recreation‘s Rob Lowe tried to steal Reeves’ love interest he wasn’t afraid to call him out about it.

How did Keanu Reeves become an actor?

The story behind Reeves’s acting career is quite fascinating. The John Wick star got his start at a performing arts school when he was a teenager. It was then that he fell in love with performing. Yet sadly according to Reeves he didn’t fit in at all at the school. According to his unauthorized biography none of the teachers believed in Reeves and they told him he would never make it as a professional actor. Because of their lack of faith in him they expelled Reeves at the end of the year.

“It was a terrible letter to receive saying you can’t come back to school next year” said Reeves. “Getting asked to leave was very upsetting.”

But despite all odds Reeves believed in himself when no one else had. So instead of giving up his acting dream he decided to move to Hollywood to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.

Keanu Reeves and Rob Lowe starred in ‘Youngblood’ together

Reeves starred in the 1986 film Youngblood when he was just starting out in Hollywood. One of the friends he made along the way was Rob Lowe who also starred in the movie. And although Reeves is known for being a “loner” who prefers to be in his own company he managed a solid friendship with Lowe while making the film.

Yet as time passed Reeves began to realize Lowe’s true colors.

“He’s all right” Reeves says about Lowe (via his biography.) “We hung out for a while but all he did was try to steal my girlfriends. He almost had his wicked way with two of them but eventually they saw through him.”

Back then Lowe was notorious for being a womanizer. Being an essential member of The Brat Pack he was on top of the world and thus he didn’t have a strong moral compass. The actor frequently cheated on his long-term girlfriend Melissa Gilbert.

Yet a lot of time has passed since then and nowadays Lowe is a totally different person.

Rob Lowe is now a monogamist

Gone are the days when Lowe would try to steal Reeves’s girlfriends. Now Lowe is a one-woman kind of guy.

“I had met my now wife Sheryl and was attempting my first try at monogamy—which was not really in my nature at the time—and I wasn’t able to do it” said Lowe (via The Daily Mail.) “It made me examine how I was living my life. That led me to getting sober which led me to changing my life—giving me everything I now have.”

Profoundly he adds “You have to want to change. I wanted it; I was ready.”

Interestingly enough Lowe’s wife Sheryl was dating Reeves right before she got married to the Parks and Rec actor. So it turns out Lowe really did succeed in stealing Reeves’ girlfriend!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmJhZG9zYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL25ld3Mvcm9sZS1jYXJpY29tLW11c3QtYmUtcmUtZXhhbWluZWQtc2F5cy1sb3dl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Role of CARICOM must be re-examined says Lowe,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcmJhZG9zYWR2b2NhdGUuY29tL25ld3Mvcm9sZS1jYXJpY29tLW11c3QtYmUtcmUtZXhhbWluZWQtc2F5cy1sb3dl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The night before his team had lost by seven points at home to a middling Charlotte Hornets squad and the Bucks’ new coach Jason Kidd was angry. Milwaukee who were hovering around .500 were slated to have the holiday off to spend with family but Kidd changed those plans and decided his roster should practice – as punishment. The players had to cancel flights and alert their family of the change – something of course they did not want to do. During the Christmas Eve practice Sanders went full-on. He didn’t lollygag but peeved he also didn’t back away from engaging his coach in confrontation. Afterwards while he was the last one left in the locker room his body started to break down.

“I was cramping from my ears to my toes” Sanders tells the Guardian. “Full body cramps.”

It was the second time that this stress reaction had happened to him during his young career and it forced Sanders to quickly seek medical treatment. Sanders was hospitalized that Christmas Eve and Christmas. He never returned to the Bucks practice facility again despite having signed a four-year $44m contract extension the year before. “I physically and mentally could not get myself back there” he says. “Nothing could get me in the car to go there. I had such a block.” The 6ft 11in center who’d averaged nearly a double-double and almost three blocks per game a few seasons before was now the one stifled. “I didn’t touch a basketball for the next two years. Not a shot not a dribble.”

Sanders was born on 21 November 1988 in Fort Pierce Florida and grew up “in the trenches”. There were gangs seemingly on every street in his neighborhood. His parents split when he was a kid and both suffered from untreated mental health issues. “They had all this trauma” Sanders says “all this pain. They were predisposed to a lot of violence [while] not understanding the power of therapy the power of meditation.”

As a kid Sanders loved to draw. It was his “getaway.” He wanted to illustrate comics and work for Disney. He had a deep interest in the ocean too won a grant to study oceanography and got to ride in submarines. He was tall but didn’t have any particular interest in basketball. But it was a basketball that would save him.

“Because I lived in the projects” Sanders says “automatically where you live there are places you can’t go [due to gang conflicts].” He found that if he rode his bike from his home to his grandmother’s or cousin’s house while carrying a basketball he was left alone. Gangs even brutal ones tend to respect the kids who can use the game to get out of the neighborhood.

“I had a ball everywhere I went” he says. “It was my pass. Like ‘Oh he’s going to play basketball he’s just going to the court. If I didn’t have that ball I would’ve constantly been getting checked. I would probably have had to attach myself to a gang to protect myself. But I didn’t even play.”

It wasn’t until high school that he began to really take to the game. He was already 6ft 6in by the time he was in the 10th grade but he was raw: In his first game he scored on his own basket. But he started watching the pros more. His idol was Tracy McGrady who played for the nearby Orlando Magic. Sanders wore arm bands like him modeled his game after McGrady’s. He soon managed double-digit blocks. Later during his 11th and 12th grades his team was dominant in the region. And as a senior he started playing AAU traveling as far as Las Vegas for games. It was the people he met then that he bonded and later enrolled with at VCU.

Sanders’ college team was a force. During his three years there his squad won 75 games and only lost 27. After his junior year he decided to turn pro and he was selected by Milwaukee with the 15th overall pick. Had he stayed in college he would have played for the VCU team that made the Final Four under coach Shaka Smart. Still he was excited for the NBA. “You shoot a million jump shots and you want to get paid” he says. But in the end the NBA wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. “It was a blessing but it was also a lot” he says. “I come from nothing and then you become the one that has everything. People who are supposed to guide you become your dependents. And you’re too young for that.”

Sanders lacked a support system in the league and his personal life. “You get fed to the sharks in a lot of ways” he says. “You can find yourself in a very vulnerable position … It can feel like a setup it can feel like a trap. I felt so alone. It was so hard to even express what I was going through. At the time in 2012 no one said they had anxiety or depression – maybe Delonte West but everyone was outcasting him.”

During his second year in the NBA Sanders smoked a joint for the first time passed to him by teammates. The drug helped like medicine. But league drug testing led to suspensions rehabs and ostracization. (Today the NBA doesn’t test for weed.)

“Do I gravitate to some pills and other drugs or do I do alcohol?” he wondered then about substances that wouldn’t be detected. Not only that but his need to be creative was no longer thriving. He felt stymied. “I was yearning for support yearning to be heard. But there was nothing in the manuscript for what I was going through at that time.” Sanders became one of the first players to talk about mental health – though now thanks to others such as DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love it’s a much more accepted topic. However when you’re the first to do something you’re often judged harshly for it. “There was no way I was the first one [to have mental health issues]” he says. “But I was the first one to speak up.”

Today Sanders is glad he did. Not just vocally but by publicly stepping away from the game. That choice led to conversations people are having now. “I have three sons that could be in the NBA one day” he says. “To have their mental health be respected – sometimes you got to be the one to step out on a cliff. But it’s worth it.” It wasn’t that he didn’t love the game it was that he didn’t have what he needed while participating in it. “My body and my mind are elite” he says. “But my surroundings and my environment just wasn’t.”

When he decided to walk he had two kids and he knew that if he wasn’t in the right state of mind he couldn’t ensure they would be either. Later he went to another rehab facility. This time it wasn’t one selected by the NBA for marijuana – though even in those he made close relationships with patients who were there for additions to heroin and other narcotics. This one was designed around therapy and emotional wellbeing. That was the last facility he’s been to since.

After two years away from the NBA Sanders sought a comeback. He worked out for a few teams and landed a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016-17 alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. But he still had a rehab stint he’d have to undertake for the league if he was to stay on and the team at the time had its own internal turmoil he says. He lasted only a handful of games before he was waived. Leaving the NBA for good despite still being in his prime in his 20s brought a great deal of criticism. But Sanders doesn’t stress about those comments. His philosophy is that if someone isn’t going to be there at your funeral why care about what they say? “One minute you’re larger than life” he says. “And the next [in their eyes] you’re lower than dirt.”

Still at his peak Sanders who is a member of and continues to work with the NBA Retired Players Association was regarded my many as one of the best defensive players in the league. He was stopping his heroes in the paint players he’d idolized. “I was their nightmare” he says. “I was like ‘I can really play this game. This game is really meant for me!’”

As reported by Law.com the May 3 ruling comes after the incubator began its legal action back in 2015.

The case filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware claims that patents for networking and broadcasting were used in Activision's multiplayer title.

The publisher owes Acceleration Bay $18 million in copyright infringement for World of Warcraft and $5.4 million for two Call of Duty titles.

Jurors were asked two questions to reach a verdict among them was ""Did Acceleration Bay prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Activision's products as identified below infringe one or more claims of the following asserted patents?""

In response to the question the jury was then asked after verdict to ""reasonably compensate Acceleration Bay for Activision's infringement of Acceleration Bay's asserted patents.""

While the case against Activision Blizzard has been decided in favor of the tech incubator it has also filed similar patent infringement suits against EA Take-Two and Amazon Web Services.

In response to the ruling Activision Blizzard said ""While we are disappointed we believe there is a strong basis for appeal. We have never used the patented technologies at issue in our games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC91cy1uZXdzL25ldy1tZXhpY28tY291cGxlLWdyYW50ZWQtMS0ybS1wcml6ZS0zLXdpc2hlcy1mb3ItZmluZGluZy1nZW5pZS1sYW1wLWluLWVsYWJvcmF0ZS1tb250aHMtbG9uZy10cmVhc3VyZS1odW50L9IBlgFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC91cy1uZXdzL25ldy1tZXhpY28tY291cGxlLWdyYW50ZWQtMS0ybS1wcml6ZS0zLXdpc2hlcy1mb3ItZmluZGluZy1nZW5pZS1sYW1wLWluLWVsYWJvcmF0ZS1tb250aHMtbG9uZy10cmVhc3VyZS1odW50L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Couple granted $1.2M prize 3 wishes for finding 'genie lamp' in elaborate months-long treasure hunt,"A New Mexico couple unearthed a genie lamp worth three wishes and $1.2 million in the Texas desert after using a clue from the classic 90s sitcom “Seinfeld” to win an elaborate treasure-hunting game.

Ron Novak and Michelle Bush spent more than two months across three trips to Dallas to hunt for the lamp hidden by the company Treasure Games which launched the contest in January according to WWPL.

It was the company’s first-ever competition offering the winner the choice of $1 million cash or three wishes worth $1.2 million Dirk Gibson the founder of Treasure Games told the outlet.

On their third trip to Dallas they decided to stay an extra day longer than planned because they felt close to finding the life-changing treasure.

The couple said they realized the vital clue was related to an episode of “Seinfeld.”

Fortunately for them that decision paid off.

“The initial moment I was in shock” Novak told the outlet.

The exact clue from the hit sitcom that led to the lamp’s discovery wasn’t revealed.

However the couple did share that they chose to accept the three wishes worth $1.2 million after finding the lamp.

But instead of spending the first wish on themselves they opted to donate money to a charity Hare Krishna Food for Life Group which helped Novak when he was homeless.

“For me it was the biggest gift to be able to give them money for this because I used to be a taker. I just took and I needed help and wanted help” Novak said.

For their second wish the couple bought the Southwest Motel in their native New Mexico to fix up.

For their third and final wish they asked for a Sprinter van big enough to fit their four dogs.

“We bought the van for the dogs. That’s an internal joke” Bush told WWLP.

The couple was so thrilled by their treasure-hunting experience that they plan to launch one of their own for others to enjoy.

“It will be a lot easier than this one — meant to be solved within a weekend or a week” Bush told the outlet.

“It will start at $5000 at least” said Novak.

As for the company Treasure Games they revealed their second Wish Lamp hunt worth a $1 million prize kicks off in June.

The competition is open to anyone willing to sign up for a subscription fee to the particular game in season — which varies in price depending on the value of the prize according to the Treasure Games website.

During the hunts those subscribed will get clues pointing toward the lamp every day.

Anyone 13 and up can subscribe to play and have a chance to win the life-changing prizes the company offers."

Claiming it was acting to fight racism the board had targeted schools named for George Washington Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln among others.

The school board says it stands by its efforts and only reversed the decision to avoid the expense of “frivolous litigation.” But the reversal was a result of the public outcry anger at the arrogant and light-minded manner in which the proposed changes were decided and the criteria used by the board majority to determine who would be erased.

School board President Gabriela López declared in a February interview with the New Yorker magazine that their goal was to dismantle “white supremacy culture.” The board was determined to deal with any past conduct they disagreed with by wiping it out. They sought to impose their view that all history and politics must be viewed through the lens of race. To them class and class divisions — and the facts themselves — are irrelevant.

Any historical figure they deemed guilty of racist activity of any kind was to be removed. Washington and Jefferson because they were slaveholders. Lincoln because of his policies toward Native Americans. Paul Revere based on false information that he participated in an attack on a Native American tribe.

They had considered “disappearing” Malcolm X as a sexist but decided that was going too far.

Much of the debate zeroed in on the proposed removal of names of participants regardless of their contributions in the two great revolutions in U.S. history — the American Revolution that wrested independence from British colonial rule and the Civil War that abolished slavery.

As the Militant pointed out when the board first approved the name changes removing these names would erase the revolutionary history that working people and youth need to know. Absent was any recognition of how these revolutions laid the basis for workers’ and other social struggles today including fights against racist oppression.

The American Revolution of 1776 was the first victorious anti-colonial revolution of the capitalist epoch. It established a republic instead of rule by a king. And it opened the door for the rise of social classes capable of leading a mass movement to abolish slavery.

“Uprooting the problematic names and symbols that currently clutter buildings streets throughout the city is a worthy endeavor” Jeremiah Jeffries chairman of the school board’s renaming committee told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Debate in Selma

The destruction of the real history of this country is also being considered in Selma Alabama today. A petition to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma — where marchers fighting for voting rights in 1965 were brutally beaten by cops and thugs on what became known as “Bloody Sunday” — has gained over half a million signatures. The petition proposes naming the bridge after John Lewis a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader of that march who was severely beaten. He later became a leading Democratic Party politician and member of Congress.

Pettus was a Confederate general and a leader of the Ku Klux Klan as well as U.S. senator under Jim Crow segregation. Using the criteria of the San Francisco School Board the bridge’s name would surely be changed or torn down.

But Lewis who died last year was opposed to the renaming. “The Edmund Pettus Bridge symbolizes both who we once were and who we have become today” he wrote in a 2015 editorial co-authored with Alabama Congresswoman Terri Sewell. “Instead of hiding our history behind a new name we must embrace it — the good and the bad. The historical context of the Edmund Pettus Bridge makes the events of 1965 even more profound.”

Renaming the bridge Lewis and Sewell wrote would diminish the enormity of the historic change brought about by that 1965 battle one of the turning points in the overthrow of Jim Crow segregation that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act.

Lynda Lowery who at 14 years old was also one of the protesters beaten on the bridge says of the proposed renaming “It’s part of history. Leave my bridge alone.”

Her sister Jo Ann Bland says there is something empowering about the name Edmund Pettus for Black people when they cross the bridge each year to commemorate the 1965 protests. “I bet he’s rolling in his grave every time we walk across that bridge” she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Matild Palace a Luxury Collection Hotel will open on May 31 in a UNESCO World Heritage Site which has undergone an extensive restoration.

(Bill Roth / ADN)

Groups of investors are moving ahead with plans to build three hotels in Midtown Anchorage including a four-story Aloft Hotel set to open next spring.

The efforts have excited city officials who see them as a signal that Alaska’s once-growing travel industry might soon regain its footing after the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the projects face challenges including lumber and steel prices that have jumped during the pandemic and lingering uncertainty about the pace of the economic recovery once the pandemic ends.

“The big question is timing and how fully does the market come back?” said Michael Mohn with Seattle-based hotel consultancy Kennedy & Mohn.

The 146-room Aloft Hotel under construction at the southwest corner of C Street and 36th Avenue is moving ahead quickly. A dual-branded Holiday Inn Express and Candlewood Suites as well as a Courtyard by Marriott to replace one that burned during construction in 2019 are also planned along a half-mile stretch along C Street sometimes called “Hotel Row.”

Crews begin work on an Aloft Hotel

Developers behind the Aloft Hotel had originally planned to open the doors this spring.

But the collapse of Alaska’s tourism industry during the pandemic led by canceled cruise ship voyages last summer put plans on hold for a year.

“We were at a point where we could hit pause and we did that to manage the risks better” said Anton Villacorta the project manager for JL Properties.

JL is owned by Anchorage developers Jonathan Rubini and Leonard Hyde who own the land where the project will be built.

The project is back on track for construction and plans to open next spring Villacorta said.

The Aloft Hotel a Marriott International brand will cater to tech-savvy tourists. It will offer voice-activated features and door locks controlled by mobile phones and feature art and music by local artists.

The foundation was recently put in Villacorta said.

“In the next week or so it will start looking like a building” he said.

The construction value of the hotel is $16 million. But once beds furnishings and details are added it will cost more than $30 million Villacorta said.

The prices of lumber and steel needed for construction have risen significantly during the pandemic pushing up the cost of construction he said. But that hasn’t dampened enthusiasm.

“We’re pretty bullish” Villacorta said. “Tourists will come back.”

“Alaska is pretty much on everyone’s bucket list” he said. “These three new hotels will be in good shape.”

High prices for materials slow the Holiday Inn Express

The high lumber and steel prices contributed to a construction delay for the Holiday Inn Express and Candlewood Suites at the southeast corner of 48th Avenue and C Street officials said.

The high prices have been blamed on factors such as global shipping delays and increased demand for building material as well as factory closures and reduced production during the pandemic.

At four stories tall the hotel will feature 193 rooms and suites providing options for quick visits in addition to longer stays in the suites city officials said.

The Koehler Organization a hotel developer based in South Dakota is pursuing the development at a construction value of $22 million according to city records.

The hotel was originally planned for completion next year said Todd Major with ACSC Builders of Fairbanks the project’s general contractor.

But the plans have been delayed until 2023 because of the high costs he said.

“The current lumber markets are cost prohibitive to keep moving forward” he said.

ACSC plans to start foundation and ground-related utilities work this year. But other construction is delayed until the “market climate is less hostile” he said.

The project has applied for a city permit and its building plans are under review said Bob Doehl building official for the Municipality of Anchorage.

A third hotel project awaits insurance payment

Investors behind a 141-room Courtyard by Marriott which was destroyed during construction by a fire in 2019 “fully intend” to rebuild when the insurance payment is complete said Ric Marko with Anchorage MC Holding the landowner.

The company is suing underwriters with Lloyd’s of London insurance company.

“I don’t know how long the process will take and what the results will be but we are optimistic we’ll be rewarded enough money to rebuild the Courtyard” Marko said.

The hotel would be built just south of the Holiday Inn Express and Candlewood Suites at 4960 A St. Doehl said. Its full value was originally $35 million.

The Courtyard hotel’s permit for construction was reactivated earlier this year Doehl said.

Doehl said the activity by hotel developers appears to be a good sign for the Anchorage economy.

“When you see this new inventory coming into place it shows there’s confidence in tourism returning sooner rather than later” Doehl said.

Hotel growth strong in Anchorage

If built the Holiday Inn Express and Courtyard by Marriott will join other midsize hotels on “Hotel Row” a section of C Street from just north of Tudor Road to International Airport Road.

Mohn said hotels in Anchorage have historically performed extremely well. Strong demand in summer allows hoteliers to charge high rates that make up for reduced business in winter he said.

Eight hotels have been built in Anchorage since 2011 at a construction value of about $100 million according to city records. Most of those have gone up in Midtown.

Mohn believes the three planned Midtown hotels will be built but problems around the pandemic could add to delays he said.

Growing cruise ship travel in recent years had pushed Alaska visitor numbers to record levels before the pandemic.

But what Alaska tourism will look like in the future is anyone’s guess he said. Canada halted large-ship cruise travel through February 2022. Alaska’s congressional delegation has proposed a workaround to a law that requires large cruise ships to stop in Canada before they arrive in Alaska but time is running out.

Once cruise ship travel does resume Mohn said bookings might not reach pre-pandemic levels if some people remain wary of catching COVID-19.

And business and government travel could be reduced if many meetings continue to happen online.

“We’ve learned in the last 14 months that not all travel is essential travel” he said.

Still Mohn said there’s room for more hotels in Anchorage in part because the city is a required stop for so many travelers in Alaska.

Some cruise ship travelers head out on their own after their cruise-based packages end in Alaska. They help fill downtown and Midtown hotels he said.

Large groups of business and government travelers and Alaskans making long-term medical visits to Anchorage also help underpin the hotel market officials said.

Marko said there’s an old adage in the hotel industry that rings true today.

“There are never too many new hotels” Marko said. “But there are too many older ones. Everyone likes a new hotel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZXR1cmJvbmV3cy5jb20vYnVsZ2FyaWFuLXN3aW1taW5nLWNlbGVicml0eS1leWVpbmctc2V5Y2hlbGxlcy1mb3ItbmV4dC1zd2ltbWluZy1jaGFsbGVuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bulgarian swimming celebrity eyeing Seychelles for next swimming challenge,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 410 Client Error: Gone for url: https://eturbonews.com/bulgarian-swimming-celebrity-eyeing-seychelles-for-next-swimming-challenge/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZXR1cmJvbmV3cy5jb20vYnVsZ2FyaWFuLXN3aW1taW5nLWNlbGVicml0eS1leWVpbmctc2V5Y2hlbGxlcy1mb3ItbmV4dC1zd2ltbWluZy1jaGFsbGVuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8wNC8yNS9oaWx0b24tdW52ZWlscy1ob21ld29vZC1zdWl0ZXMtcmVmcmVzaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton unveils Homewood Suites refresh – Business Traveller,"Hilton has unveiled a brand refresh for its extended stay Homewood Suites brand.

Kyle Marmillion is a busy guy.

His day job is as an adviser with the insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan Agency specializing in property and casualty employee benefits and personal insurance.

“I have had tremendous opportunities and I am very grateful for each of the opportunities I have taken In the grand scheme of things I still feel as though I am just getting started.”

He also coaches a boys youth lacrosse team.

“I am grateful to serve in each of these areas and others as well” Marmillion said. “I remember traveling up to the Park Cities area in college on lacrosse trips and was just blown away by the welcoming people and how close together everything was. When I moved to Dallas I was quickly reminded of this and the people and the community make it a great place to call home.”

Marmillion first moved to Austin from Vermont in 2002.

“The road to the house in Vermont was dirt and it wound through woods before opening up to Lake Champlain” he said of his home state. “It was absolutely stunning (beautiful in the summer and very cold in the winter) and it instilled a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors at a young age that continues to be very important to me.”

Those players always came with the adjective ""deadly"" in print and in radio and TV commentary.

There wasn't much college basketball to be found on TV in the 1950s and into the '60s but if Indiana was on the Big Ten Game of the Week with Jimmy Rayl you wanted to see those soaring jumpers that were majestic even in black and white.

As grand as was Edgerton's championship in 1960 my favorite actual title game in the one-class days was Marshall 74 Cloquet 73 in 1963 a shootout featuring deadly shooters Terry Porter and Whitey Johnson for Marshall and Mike Forrest and Dave ""Mouse"" Meisner for Cloquet.

What made the long-range shooter mesmerizing was coaches were very selective in allowing players to shoot from 20 feet or more. Now we have the opposite. Even the ""blacksmiths"" as we called them have the green light to damage rims.

Amid the hail of threes from NBA teams the great shooters can become lost among teammates throwing the ball in the general direction (yes Josh Okogie we're talking about you).

On a late night early this month I ran across an NBA game. Five seconds later Steph Curry was dribbling and then instantly a 30-foot shot was away and dead center.

I kept watching Steph that night and whenever possible since.

Steph has kept making unearthly shots off one foot or two squared up or tilted against defenders convinced they had him covered or that he was too deep to shoot.

In the 10 games from April 6 through Friday night Curry averaged 38.5 points taking 14 threes per night and making 49%. He's had one clunker a 2-for-14 on threes in this run. He will be at Target Center on Thursday night.

I sent texts to a few exceptional shooters with a Minnesota connection and asked: ""Have you been watching Steph?""

One who had been was Blake Hoffarber the excellent Gophers shooter from 2007 to 2011 and author of two legendary last-instant moments: The two-handed toss from his rear end that sent Hopkins into a second overtime vs. Eastview and soon a state championship on March 19 2005 and the lefthanded flip after a full-court heave that buzzer-beat Indiana for the Gophers in the 2008 Big Ten tournament.

As it turns out Hoffarber's interest in Curry goes beyond watching ""the greatest shooter of all time"" on this historic roll at age 33.

""We were together in a weeklong camp for two years"" Hoffarber said. ""It was sponsored by the NBA Players Association for invited high school players.

""Neither of us was being recruited then by major conferences. We were there as shooters and we spent a lot of time together doing that in a back gym.

""The only reason Steph wasn't being pursued by Duke Carolina Kentucky was because he was just a scrawny kid. He was a great shooter even then although more of a form shooter … not the creative guy he became in the NBA.

""He's still not the biggest guy so he shoots fadeaways sideways off one foot two feet. The most amazing thing is he's starting to shoot before the ball gets to him. Great release but unbelievable anticipation.

""The three-point craziness you see now … I think that's Steph. With what he did to make the Warriors the NBA power; in my opinion he single-handedly changed the NBA and now the rest of basketball.""

Hoffarber 33 on Tuesday played one season of pro ball in Marseilles France. He's now a senior vice president for the Marsh & McLennan Agency.

Jordan (Rossman) and Blake live in Wayzata and have daughters Tate 2½ and Wren one month. Jordan from Minnetonka was on the dance team at Wisconsin.

""Less basketball many dance recitals in your future young dad"" a reporter suggested.

East Lyme — Despite Sunday morning's rain two area women participated in the virtual 9/11 Memorial Nationwide Run/Walk.

Miosotys Santiago of Groton was joined by her friend Michelle Allen on the Niantic Bay Boardwalk as they walked in honor of Santiago's late fiancé Andrew J. Bailey who died in the terrorist attack on the World Trade center. Bailey was a security supervisor for the Marsh McLennan insurance brokerage.

Santiago has participated in the annual event in New York City with friends though last year's walk was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year's event was virtual and participants logged their walks from across the country with the goal of hitting 20000 miles.

""I know it's raining but I just can't stop smiling"" Santiago said from underneath her umbrella. ""That's all Andrew shining down.""

Santiago is a survivor of the attack herself.

A New York City native she worked at the World Trade Center and happened to be 40 minutes late that morning after dropping off her kids at school. She remembers walking to the plaza hearing a plane overhead and watching it hit the building.

On instinct she said she went inside the building to help.

""Someone grabbed me and pulled me out of there I wish I knew who and we ran for our lives"" she recalled. A photo published in Newsweek shows Santiago rushing from the building with a female police officer.

Santiago was injured by debris that hit her back as she escaped to safety.

""I lost it all that day"" she said ""my love my friends my job.""

She spent the following months at the site trying to find Bailey holding his photo and toothbrush.

She has since moved to southeastern Connecticut and now works as a motivational speaker consultant and author. Her recent memoir ""God's Diamond"" is for sale on her website exemplify2edify.org.

""It's a day that's inspired me every day to this day"" she said of Sept. 11 2001. ""Loss is a powerful thing that has propelled me to help others through this day.""

He had spent his entire life trying to compensate for his tough upbringing.

His mother died when he was just 7 years old leaving his father to raise five kids. Hal’s father soon remarried adding three more children to the family but that marriage failed in short order. Hal and his siblings had no choice but to take care of themselves because of his father’s struggle with alcoholism.

“There is a good chance in today’s world we would have ended up in the foster care system” Hal shared.

Determined not to be like his dad Hal was a self-proclaimed overachiever. By age 39 he had climbed the corporate ladder to Executive Vice President of Anthony Industries a Los Angeles sporting-goods company.

But the cost was everything outside of his job.

He worked 70 to 80 hours per week had no wife or children and relied heavily on alcohol to get through his days.

“On the outside it looked like a great life. On the inside it wasn’t very good” Hal said.

Hal made the decision to seek more meaning and fulfillment in his life. His first step was to leave his job. His second – get sober.

“I wasn’t taking care of myself. A person all wrapped up in himself makes a pretty small package” he admitted.

A Whole Lot More to Give

Beginning in 1994 Hal spent the next three years completely redesigning himself turning to volunteerism to see if he could help himself by helping others.

He started by delivering food Monday through Friday for Meals on Wheels. Then he served as a natural disaster responder for the American Red Cross. Following that he volunteered time to coach Pop Warner youth football teams.

His first foray back into the workforce was mentoring and helping recovering alcoholics at the Scripps Hospital Recovery Center.

“I discovered being in service is amazing. It changes people’s lives” he said. “As soon as you start helping others you’ll realize you’ve got a whole lot more to give.”

Hal made his way back into the world of finance as Controller and General Manager of ADS Environmental Services but he didn’t leave philanthropy behind. Partnering with a group of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) he became a founding board member of the Day for Change a non-profit which has contributed more than $1.3 million in grants to San Diego organizations that serve abused neglected and underserved children.

The program’s first grant recipient was Walden Family Services San Diego’s largest foster care adoption and youth services agency.

Specializing in matching hard-to-place kids with loving parents was an endeavor close to Hal’s heart and it wasn’t long after the grant that Hal was serving as Board Chair of the organization a title he would hold for 11 years.

“I could have been one of these kids” Hal stated. “They did nothing wrong but they didn’t get a fair shot in life. They’re not somebody else’s kids. They’re our kids.”

In 2000 Hal took on the job of CFO at Barney & Barney. He also became a founding board member of the Barney & Barney Foundation when the company celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2009.

Joining The San Diego Foundation

A few short years later Hal’s friend Garry Ridge Chief Executive Officer of WD-40 Company asked if Hal would be interested in joining the Board of Governors at The San Diego Foundation.

Hal Dunning (pictured left) sits with Brian Zumbano Vice President Chief Development & Stewardship Officer during a keynote speaker presentation at The Foundation’s 2019 Annual Meeting.

“I was fascinated with the thought of it” Hal remembers. “I felt that maybe I could help make the philanthropic community become more efficient. Looking back now I realize The Foundation really has become what I thought it could be back in 2014.”

Serving in his seventh year on the board Hal has enjoyed every minute of it.

He is most proud of how The Foundation brought the community together in response to COVID-19 through the San Diego COVID-19 Community Response Fund. And he could not be more complimentary of the leadership and the staff.

Right now he’s most excited about the launch of the Black Community Investment Fund which prioritizes and invests in community-led innovative efforts that increase racial equity and generational wealth for Black San Diegans.

“I fantasize that San Diego can be the most anti-racist city in the country” he declared.

He’s doing his part to realize that dream.

In November he and a small group of community members and leaders established The AntiRacism Institute dedicated to creating measurable progress in both racial literacy and closing the racial wealth gap.

Now the President and Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Agency’s West Region Hal is much more than just his career.

He has a wife and a daughter. He has philanthropy. He has fulfillment.

Often he looks back at the three-year period that reshaped his life. It all started changing when he began devoting himself to service.

“I encourage everyone to try it” he said. “There’s something for everyone. Try giving back at different places and see where your heart leads you.”"

The Money Message website which contains minimal references to Nedbank lists four main uses for the new functionality. They are: create bills and send them to customers in WhatsApp; link bank accounts to the service to receive payments; make payments “through a secure Masterpass connection;” and make payments by scanning QR codes in WhatsApp.

To begin using the service a future recipient or sender of money starts by registering through WhatsApp according to a Q-and-A posted on the Money Message website.

To use the service a WhatsApp account-holder will need to upload a photo of himself or herself. The reason according to Nedbank: “To help prevent identity theft we need to verify the person registering for Money Message. It’s part of our compliance with financial regulations in South Africa to match your ID or passport photo with your selfie.”

While marketing materials mention businesses extensively recipients of funds through the service do not have to be registered with the South African government as businesses according to Money Message’s website.

A news release from Mastercard states that the new service is a collaboration between Mastercard Nedbank and FinTech firm Ukheshe.

“The need for a diverse range of contactless payment methods is more important today than we could have possibly imagined as we seek to rebuild the economy by giving businesses the ability to transact in a safe and secure way” Chipo Mushwana executive for emerging payments at Nedbank said in a prepared statement. “In order to support entrepreneurship and sustainable business growth across all markets we need to deliver low-cost accessible and flexible solutions that leverage widely accessible technologies. Money Message looks to overcome a variety of cost security and technical barriers by enabling micro merchants and their customers to transact with each other easily on an existing platform which is WhatsApp.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy13b3JlLW1lLW91dC1hbmQtdG9vay1tZS1mb3ItMjEtNjAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Wore Me Out And Took Me For $21.60,"In 2019 I earned a $99 companion certificate on American Airlines by spending over $20000 on my Barclays AAdvantage Aviator Silver Mastercard. My real goal for the spending was help towards elite status – qualifying miles and qualifying dollars – but the ability to bring two people with me on a trip for $99 plus tax each was an extra perk.

That certificate was going to expire during the pandemic (travel complete by January 31 2021) but got extended to June 30 2021 so I just applied it to a reservation.

Recently I haven’t been able to use it because flights have been available for less than $99. However I’ve got an upcoming trip that

Met the 14 day advance purchase requirements



Met the fare class requirements (L M N Q S V G or O classes)



Avoided published blackout dates



Was running about $289 per person

And I was going to be flying with my wife and daughter so why not use it?

These are paper certificates that you have to mail in . American doesn’t actually issue the tickets until they receive and process the certificate though new certificates have a more electronic process. You still will have to call Meeting Services (800-433-1790) but they will be able to find the certificate in your account and get the tickets issued.

I found the flights I wanted and called in. The agent had no problem setting up the reservation. But we ran into several problems with pricing.

First she set up pricing for a single companion (two people at regular price one companion) because she looked up the wrong STAR File. She said she doesn’t get many of these two-companion certificates.

Then she quoted the price of the companions as $99 plus $54 in taxes ($153 per person). But the certificate is clear that

The certificate entitles the AAdvantage Aviator Silver World Elite Mastercard cardmember named on the reverse to pay $99 for the ticketing fee plus $21.60 to $43.20 in government taxes and fees based on itinerary for each round trip qualifying economy fare ticket for up to two companions when an individual roundtrip qualifying fare ticket is purchased by and for the primary cardmember using the AAdvantage Aviator Silver World Elite Mastercard.

The certificate discloses maximum taxes of $43.20. So it seemed to me that American was overcharging me by $10.80 per ticket or $21.60.

The agent spoke to her support desk who agreed that this publish tax maximum applied but they couldn’t do anything about it. We involved another desk who was unwilling to adjust the taxes ‘because that requires a higher level of authorization than we have available.’ I went back on hold for a third department which didn’t answer.

At this point I’d been on the phone for an hour. I had been avoiding booking this reservation because I knew it would take a good bit of time. I can be productive while I’m on hold but I can’t take calls or be quite as productive while listening in the background.

Five minutes before a commitment I made to record a podcast the agent came on and I agreed to pay the fully quoted taxes. I knew that if I left the line I’d have to start all over with another agent and I decided not to fight the $21.

I’ll fight even a small amount on principle but this time American had beaten me because I didn’t have the time to spare.

In fairness when doing my own tax calculation I think they should have charged me $53.33 per passenger though not $54.

US Transportation Tax (US) $6.93 (7% of $99)



$6.93 (7% of $99) United States Flight Segment Tax Domestic (ZP) $17.20



$17.20 United States Passenger Civil Aviation Security Service Fee (AY) $11.20



$11.20 US Passenger Facility Charge (XF) $18.00

However American should have honored its credit card benefit as advertised and disclosed perhaps reducing the $99 by $10.80 on each ticket to match. But they wore me out and took me for $20 instead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmludGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLXVudmVpbHMtdG9vbC1mb3ItYmFua3MtdG8taGVscC1jb25zdW1lcnMtY2FsY3VsYXRlLWNhcmJvbi1mb290cHJpbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard Unveils Tool For Banks To Help Consumers Calculate Carbon Footprint,"Mastercard has unveiled a carbon calculator for banks to show cardholders the carbon impact of their consumption and simple ways to contribute to reforestation. Over two in five Brits see reducing their carbon footprint as more important now than pre-Covid.

Global research across 24 countries on sustainability commissioned by Mastercard reveals a growing consumer passion for the environment as a result of the pandemic. Eighty-five per cent of people are willing to take personal action to combat environmental and sustainability issues in 2021.

Forty-four per cent of Brits see reducing their carbon footprint as more important now than pre-pandemic. While more than a third feel environmental issues have increased in importance.

As part of Mastercard’s Sustainability initiatives it has developed the Mastercard Carbon Calculator with strategic partner Doconomy. The tool integrated across Mastercard’s global network enables access to insights and data about the carbon impact of consumer’s consumption and enables people to contribute to preserving the environment.

It enables consumers to receive a snapshot of the carbon emissions generated by their purchases across spending categories. The calculations are powered by the independently verified Åland Index and can be further enhanced with CO2 equivalents (such as trees) as well as tips about living more sustainably.

Priceless Planet Coalition

Consumers also have the option to contribute to the forest restoration projects of the Priceless Planet Coalition – either by donating or using loyalty rewards programmes by their banks. Banks can integrate the Carbon Calculator into their mobile apps through new APIs that are now available on Mastercard Developers.

Jorn Lambert Mastercard chief digital officer said: “The Mastercard Carbon Calculator informs consumers about the carbon footprint of their purchases so that they can make more mindful spending decisions and contribute to forest restoration.

“By embedding sustainability in the very fabric of our business we can unlock the power of our network reaching billions of consumers and partners to create positive change for the environment. This builds on the creation last year of the Priceless Planet Coalition which unites businesses and consumers to restore 100 million trees.”

Additionally until 3 May Mastercard cardholders in the US can bid on a selection of curated experiences with all auction proceeds benefitting the Priceless Planet Coalition’s forest restoration projects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bmV3c2VneXB0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L2FjdWQtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1kaXNjdXNzLXR1cm5pbmctbmV3LWNhcGl0YWwtaW50by1jYXNobGVzcy1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ACUD MasterCard discuss turning New Capital into cashless city - Dailynewsegypt,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dailynewsegypt.com', port=443): Read timed out.

But while those deceits may be forgivable if you hit it off with your date at the other end of the spectrum are far worse cons.

In 2020 with more of us stuck at home often desperate for some company or conversation the number of romance scams reported to the crime body Action Fraud rose by 15%. Over the past 18 months it has received reports of more than 7000 cases with losses totalling £69.7m – an average of almost £10000 a victim.

Romance scammers create what appears to be a genuine relationship that can go on for weeks or months. Once trust has been built the fraudster will then ask for what are often large sums of money.

Another way that criminals extract money from unwitting daters is through sextortion scams. These involve acquiring intimate photos or videos of an individual “nudes” and using these to blackmail the victim. The National Crime Agency (NCA) says reports of sextortion scams soared in 2020 from 1607 reports in 2019 to 2881. In 2015 the number of cases reported was only 345.

The majority of sextortion crimes can be traced back to organised crime groups mostly based overseas National Crime Agency

The NCA says victims are often initially contacted through social media and dating websites. “Sadly this a serious and organised crime that preys upon people’s emotions and vulnerability. While both men and women can be victims our evidence suggests that men aged between 19 and 35 are predominately targets” an NCA spokesperson says.

“The majority of sextortion crimes can be traced back to organised crime groups mostly based overseas. For them it’s a low-risk and easy way to make money but for victims the impact and repercussions can be long-lasting. We know of at least four recent incidents in the UK where young men who were targeted saw no other way out than to take their own life.”

Dating apps are a common place for scammers to find their victims with Action Fraud reporting that the top five platforms they use are Facebook Plenty of Fish Instagram Tinder and Match.com.

In late 2020 the Match Group which owns Plenty of Fish Tinder Match.com as well as OkCupid ran a series of romance fraud protection adverts as part of a campaign with Action Fraud.

Justine Sacco from the Match Group told Guardian Money that the company had a dedicated team and “sophisticated technology” that patrols for spam and fraud including automated or manual reviews of each member profile to block IP addresses from high-alert countries identify stolen credit card numbers and detect suspicious language in profiles.

“The Match Group brands instruct users to never send money to someone they met on our platforms and to report any individual who asks that they do” she says. “These steps are designed to stop scams in their tracks and help protect the next potential victim.”

Ryan Chen (not his real name) 23 was a user of the Chinese-owned dating app Tantan. He matched with a woman who appeared to live in Manchester like him. She was about his age and attractive so when she asked Chen for his Facebook and WeChat details he happily shared them.

She asked to exchange “nudes” and after receiving a video Chen obliged sending her a video in return. She didn’t reply for a few hours. He was then met with an unexpected response.

“She sent me a list of all my Facebook friends that she had downloaded somehow and she had worked out who my cousins were” he says. “She wanted me to send her $4000 to a Western Union account in the Philippines or she would send all my Facebook friends the video.”

After reading about other cases where victims had feared losing their jobs and families he says he realised “worse case for me was just lots of people seeing my nudes. I found some advice on the National Crime Agency website and followed that. I was up all night panicking but that calmed me down.”

Chen contacted the police but was not able to provide much information about the culprit. He also contacted his cousins to warn them that they might receive a message from the scammer.

After three months of messages repeating the threat he called her bluff and told her to go through with it. “That was the last time I heard from her.”

The National Crime Agency told Guardian Money it has a strategy in place to deal with these kind of crimes. “Sextortion is a borderless crime and so demands a transnational joined-up response” it says. “The National Crime Agency is in constant dialogue with international law enforcement partners on how best to tackle the issue protect victims and hold perpetrators to account.

“During the past year we’ve seen increased reporting by members of the public to UK police forces with suggestions that this is due to increased confidence in the police to deal with allegations in a sensitive and confidential manner.”

The National Crime Agency has the following advice for anyone who has been contacted by someone threatening to distribute pictures or videos that they have shared:

Don’t panic: the first big step is to recognise you are the victim in this and that you may require support to help you through what has happened.

Don’t pay: the choice to pay is yours but experience shows that where victims have paid up there is no guarantee that offenders will not still post the recording. They are in fact more likely to come back with further demands.

Don’t keep communicating: by replying to these threats it indicates to the criminals that you are someone who may be persuaded to pay their ransom.

Do consider getting support: you can contact your local police force (101) to report what has happened to you. This is particularly important if you are struggling to cope with the problem. If you are under 18 consider speaking to a trusted adult and additional support is also available via Child Exploitation and Online Protection command.

An outstanding century from Rob Yates helped Warwickshire inflict a first defeat on Essex in two years in a slow-burning classic that was decided at 6.10pm on the final evening with just eight scheduled deliveries of the match remaining.

To put the result in perspective it was Essex's first defeat in first-class cricket since 2019 - they had gone 21 games without a loss - and the first time since Simon Harmer arrived in 2017 they had conceded more than two - yes two - to lose a game in the fourth innings. Warwickshire by contrast went into this game having won only one Division One Championship match (or Bob Willis Trophy match) at home since September 2016. Harmer has not conceded more runs in an innings when he has not taken a wicket in his period at the club.

This feels like a significant moment for Warwickshire. Their new coach Mark Robinson has only been with the club a few months but already there is an added resilience to their cricket. They have now pulled off two challenging run-chases on successive Sundays demonstrating not just ability but character. The victory at Trent Bridge gave them confidence no doubt but Essex present the toughest test in Championship cricket at present. To go toe-to-toe with them for four days and prevail represents an impressive performance.

It will be especially pleasing to them that Yates and Hain should have played such a prominent role in the victory. Both are to a greater or lesser extent products of the club's system - Hain was scouted as a 14-year-old; Yates has played for the county at every level from U10s - and are seen as foundation stones in building for the team's future. As Robinson put it afterwards ""It feels like we're heading in the right direction. We're not perfect but I hope we've made the club proud today.""

He described Yates' innings - his second first-class century - as ""a coming-of-age moment"" and it was hard to disagree. A 21-year-old with a year left of his English Language degree at Birmingham University he should have been studying over the weekend. He has an overdue essay to write on the significance of Gorilla chest beating - yes really - but instead spent it defying the best team in England over the last few years in front of Alastair Cook his boyhood hero. Nobody could have measured their innings better.

He had made an impression on Cook previously. Indeed Cook had named him several months ago as one to watch when discussing players with the temperament and well-organised method to go on and play Test cricket. The calm way he judged this run-chase belied his youth and inexperience and suggested Warwickshire may have uncovered a gem. It would be a surprise if he is not still serving them in a decade.

He gave his only chance - a sharp edge that flew to slip - when the scores were level. Alastair Cook of all people was unable to hold on and Warwickshire scrambled the winning run. Essex changing at the opposite end of the ground due to Covid protocols made a point of escorting Yates to the pavilion to ensure he was afforded the ovation he deserved. It was a nice touch at the end of a match which has been played with terrific intensity.

""Cook was my idol growing up"" Yates said afterwards. ""So to do it in front of him is very special.

""It wasn't until we had about 30 more to get that I thought we had it won. Before then I thought we had taken defeat out of the equation. But I felt focussed and the guys I batted with helped me through things.""

In Hain he had an ideal partner. No one in history (who has played a minimum of 50 innings) has a higher List A average and with this match resembling a 50-over chase there were moments when it was Hain who kept things on track. So while Yates with his conventional approach might have become bogged down against this fine attack Hain was able to reverse-sweep Harmer for four or flick Porter over mid-wicket for six whenever it seemed the run-rate was starting to feel uncomfortable. He has now recorded three half-centuries in his four most recent innings and appears to have matured into the senior player this side in transition requires.

That is not to say Yates lacked strokes. Like many of the best he plays within himself for much of the time and likes to build a foundation before unveiling his range. But here he demonstrated a welcome ability to change gear at one stage skipping down the pitch to loft Harmer for six at another going deep in his crease to late-cut him for four. In terms of temperament and talent this was a deeply impressive display.

It was something of a triumph for the coaching staff too. Robinson noted after Yates' disappointing first innings that his trigger movements had changed from the pre-season period when he so impressed the coaching staff. So deciding it was best to make an intervention mid-match he suggested Yates and the club's batting coach Tony Frost arrive early for sessions in the indoor school so he could recover his rhythm and confidence. The results speak for themselves.

Hanuma Vihari deserves credit too. He looked in fine touch in recording his first half-century for the club and did much in establishing the tone of this run-chase. He looked aghast to be adjudged caught behind and may well face some censure for his reluctance to leave the crease. As things stand he is expected to play one more match for Warwickshire - the game at Durham later this week - before Pieter Malan replaces him as overseas player.

Harmer could not have done more to win this game for Essex. After top-scoring for them in their second innings he bowled an unbroken 26-over spell in Warwickshire's in which he delivered perhaps one loose ball. And while there was some turn - particularly from the footmarks quite wide of off stump - it was relatively slow and negated by some quality batting.

His latter spell was not quite as impressive. Maybe he was tired or maybe he felt forced to try a few variations as the match slipped from Essex's grasp. But this was not a case of Harmer bowling poorly so much as it was a case of Yates and co batting exceedingly well. There was little assistance from the conditions or the surface for seamers.

Essex will instead reflect that they should have scored more runs in their first innings when the pitch was at its best and that they should have held more chances when Warwickshire made their reply. Some of their ground fielding on the final day was also below the high standards they have set over recent years. Both Dan Lawrence and Paul Walter conceded boundaries from mis-fields. Given the final margin of victory it may have been significant.

""It is our first defeat in 22 matches so we shouldn't get too downbeat about it"" Essex head coach Anthony McGrath said afterwards. ""But it is upsetting. We are not used to losing and the boys are hurting in there but having said that all credit to Warwickshire they paced that innings really well. Nothing should deflect from the quality of their victory.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbGF6aWFsaS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8yNC9sYXppby12cy1hYy1taWxhbi1tYXRjaC1wcmV2aWV3LXRlYW0tbmV3cy1wcmVkaWN0aW9uLXNlcmllLWEtMjAyMC0yMS_SAWtodHRwczovL3RoZWxhemlhbGkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvbGF6aW8tdnMtYWMtbWlsYW4tbWF0Y2gtcHJldmlldy10ZWFtLW5ld3MtcHJlZGljdGlvbi1zZXJpZS1hLTIwMjAtMjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lazio vs AC Milan: Match Preview Team News Prediction,"On Monday April 26 2021 the Stadio Olimpico hosts Lazio vs AC Milan in Matchday 33 of the 2020/21 Serie A.

In the 182 times that the two clubs have played each other in Serie A the Biancocelesti have won on 38 occasions the Rossoneri have won on 80 occasions and there have been 64 draws. When playing at home Lazio has a record of 23W-38D-26L against Milan.

As it stands in the top flight of Italian football the Biancocelesti sit in sixth with a record of 18-4D-9L (58 points) and the Rossoneri sit in second with a record of 20W-6D-6L (66 points).

Lazio

This match takes place after Lazio lost 5-2 against Napoli at the Diego Armando Maradona in Matchday 32 of the 2020/21 Serie A. It was a disappointing result for the Biancocelesti who put forth a decent performance yet didn’t capitalize on their chances. A brace from Lorenzo Insigne helped secure the victory for Napoli while Dries Mertens Victor Osimhen and Mateo Politano added the other goals. Ciro Immobile and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic each scored for Lazio.

While there were some questionable decisions made by the referee Marco Di Bello the poor performance by Lazio’s backend should not be disregarded. Additionally Lazio goalkeeper Pepe Reina failed to make key saves for his side. This needs to be addressed quickly or it could be another difficult match versus Milan.

Expect a strong response from the Biancocelesti against the Rossoneri. Simone Inzaghi has recovered from COVID-19 and will be on the bench to guide his team against Stefano Pioli’s men. While Luiz Felipe is nearing a return he will still be unavailable for Lazio on Monday. In addition Gonzalo Escalante and Felipe Caicedo are likely to sit this match out.

Projected Starting XI (3-5-2): Reina; Marusic Acerbi Radu; Lazzari Milinkovic Leiva Luis Alberto Lulic; Correa Immobile

Francesco Acerbi Mohamed Fares Luis Alberto and Marco Parolo are just one yellow card away from suspension.

Milan

In Milan’s recent match against Sassuolo they lost 2-1 at the Giuseppe Meazza. The Rossoneri haven’t been in good form despite earning points in four of their past six matches. They have struggled to put in strong performances as there have been breakdowns along the way against Parma Napoli and now Sassuolo.

Milan was leading 1-0 with just under 20 minutes remaining and looked as if they were going to earn their 21st victory this season. However the Neroverdi had other plans as a brace from Giacomo Raspadori in the span of seven minutes gave Milan their sixth loss this season. It was a disastrous end to this match as Milan were outplayed by Sassuolo.

With Milan visiting Lazio on Monday at the Stadio Olimpico it won’t be easy for them as Zlatan Ibrahimovic won’t be available and both Theo Hernandez and Fikayo Tomori are struggling with minor injuries and are doubtful to start.

Projected Starting XI (4-2-3-1): Donnarumma; Calabria Kjaer Romagnoli Theo; Kessie Bennacer; Saelemaekers Calhanoglu Rebic; Mandzukic

Hakan Calhanoglu Samu Castillejo Diogo Dalot Theo Hernandez Ante Rebic and Alexis Saelemaekers are just one yellow card away from suspension.

Final Words

Milan have been the more dominant side versus Lazio in recent years. In their last eleven meetings in Serie A Lazio have managed to win just twice. During those eleven meetings the Rossoneri have earned three clean sheets and the Biancocelesti have managed to score two or more goals on only three occasions.

Lazio talisman Immobile has turned it around in recent times as he has three goals in his past two matches in Serie A. Prior to that he went scoreless in eight straight games. Additionally Immobile has scored in two straight matches and has five goals in the past five games in Serie A versus Milan. The Italian is in great form and this will be encouraging for Lazio.

Ante Rebic has stepped up in the absence of Ibrahimovic. He has scored in two of the last three matches in Serie A for Milan. Additionally in the Croatian’s three meetings versus the Biancocelesti in Serie A he has two goals and one assist.

An interesting battle will be between midfielders Milinkovic-Savic and Franck Kessie. Both the Serbian and Ivorian are having terrific seasons at their respective clubs; it will be very exciting to see two of the league’s best midfielders go head-to-head.

If Lazio are to move up in the standings they will need to be highly motivated not let their guard down and limit their mistakes against a well-managed Milan side.

Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Between the lines: The McCormick ad's focus on ""duty honor and country"" echoes an ad his official campaign put out last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9maWxtLXJvb20tb25lLWFkanVzdG1lbnQtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLXdpbGwtaGF2ZS10by1tYWtlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Film Room: One Adjustment Mason McCormick Will Have To Make,"Not only will Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round pick and South Dakota State guard Mason McCormick have to adjust to a step up in competition but he’ll also have to change some of his techniques. While McCormick is a punishing run blocker who can pull and crunch linebackers the way he’ll be asked to do so in Pittsburgh is different from what he did in college.

Linemen guards in particular are asked to pull in one of two ways. There’s the “skip pull” and the “square pull.” In college McCormick used the latter on counters and traps. The skip pull is the lineman facing the defense as he pulls “skipping” laterally as he moves down the line and up through the hole. His shoulders stay square to the line of scrimmage.

You can see Mason McCormick use the technique in these two clips Dave Bryan tweeted out in his tape review of him. He’s the left guard pulling to the right in both clips.

And this is another fun pull by LG Mason McCormick with a knockdown #Steelers #NFL pic.twitter.com/hvk8BeGjh1 — Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) April 29 2024

Legitimately fun clips no question. But there is one issue.

In the NFL most coaches teach their linemen the square pull. The guard will be square and his shoulders/body parallel to the line of scrimmage as he works down the line before getting upfield to hit his target. Here’s an example of it. Instead of taking a lateral step like the skip pull they’ll drop their inside foot to open their hips and turn before working down the track. Watch LG Isaac Seumalo execute it in last year’s Wild Card game against the Buffalo Bills.

You can see the difference. I’m sure an O-line coach can detail the pros and cons of each. The square pull despite that initial drop step is overall faster than the skip pull and that’s probably why most NFL linemen use it. Speed is the name of the game and linemen have to stay on track and not make the running back wait.

It’s a change Mason McCormick is capable of making. Like any college player going to a new coaching staff in the NFL there will be changes in technique. Some big some more subtle and this won’t be the only adjustment he’ll have to make under Pat Meyer. Pass protection is a whole ‘nother can of worms with Meyer’s aggressive brand of sets. Don’t be surprised if McCormick looks a little clunky out of the gate. He won’t be the only one but there will be plenty of rewiring in his footwork he’ll have to learn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvZ2VyYWxkLW1jY29ybWljay1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01NTA1MTE0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerald McCormick Obituary (2024) - Dunmore PA - Scranton Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thetimes-tribune/name/gerald-mccormick-obituary?id=55051145 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvZ2VyYWxkLW1jY29ybWljay1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01NTA1MTE0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Police shot and wounded Lewis while on the Eisenhower Expressway Thursday following a police chase and attempted carjacking according to authorities. NBC 5 has yet to independently verify the police account of events.

Officers recovered two guns from Lewis at the time of the arrest.

Among 16 other charges Lewis is accused of aggravated assault unlawful restraint and robbery Brown noted. He continued saying CPD is still searching for more people involved in the crime.

""You can run but you can't hide. We are going to bring you to justice for this crime. The Adams family deserves nothing less"" Brown said as a message to others who may be involved.

Jaslyn's father who was also shot Sunday was released from the hospital Brown said.

While answering questions from the media Thursday Brown issued an unprecedented warning about bringing family members into a life of crime.

""Don't put your loved ones in the car with you your mothers your wives"" he said. ""People who have nothing to do with the choices you made but they end up being the victims of your choices.""

An average McDonald's restaurant is about 4000 square feet in size according to data sourced from The Motley Fool. That makes the so-called ""Epic McD"" McDonald's location in Orlando Fla. which measures a whopping 19000 square feet the largest Mickey D's by square footage.

But the world's largest McDonald's restaurant at 6875 Sand Lake Road is outsized in more ways than one. It also boasts a bigger menu according to Reader's Digest. Diners are welcome to stick to the standard McDonald's offerings but can also sample specialty items like panini sandwiches Belgian waffles custom-made personal-sized pizzas pasta dishes and more. The restaurant also includes a dessert bar. Meals are delivered to patrons seated at tables and are served on actual ceramic plates and with real silverware.

The three-story ""Epic McD"" was established in 1976 and underwent extensive renovations in 2016. Today visitors can enjoy a huge entertainment center featuring a 20-foot-tall indoor play structure and try their hands at more than 100 arcade games. And the fun starts at the entrance—with a 30-foot-tall depiction of Ronald McDonald greeting customers.

The best part? The restaurant is open 24 hours a day seven days a week so you really can't pick the wrong time to visit.

In stark contrast the world's smallest McDonald's restaurant is apparently just under 500 square feet in size and is located in Tokyo. Not to mention an even tinier Mickey D's was set up in Sweden in 2019 but it caters to a whole different species—the bees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVkYWlseWliZXJpYW4uY29tL25ld3MvbWlsbGVyLWJlY29tZXMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1tY2RvbmFsZC1zLWZyYW5jaGlzZS1vd25lci9hcnRpY2xlX2UwMDNlMGVjLWE1ODktMTFlYi05YjE3LTU3MjVhNTA5MjdkMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miller becomes third-generation McDonald's franchise owner | Local News Stories | thedailyiberian.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Here's how,"Every pharmaceutical company is constantly searching for its next blockbuster — the billion-dollar drug that dominates a market brings in hordes of customers and deposits hefty profits in drugmakers’ bank accounts. But with every blockbuster too comes its expiration date.

Pharmaceutical giants including Merck Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie are set to lose key patents on some of their most lucrative drugs this decade. As the clock counts down to the end of that exclusivity more affordable generic and biosimilar alternatives are waiting to enter the market — taking a portion of the giants’ blockbuster business driving prescription prices down and giving consumers potentially better options.

With competition closing in these pharmaceutical companies are bracing for impact. But they’re also prepping their own playbooks healthcare analysts and industry academics say — and looking ahead to both survive business shake-ups and stymy their competitors.

What is a blockbuster drug?

A blockbuster drug is one that generates at least $1 billion in annual revenue — although in more recent years their potential for profits have climbed far higher. Best-selling drugs like AbbVie’s Humira for one have reached annual sales of more $20 billion annually.

“It’s very hard to try to replace that” said Matt Phipps a biotech analyst at investment bank William Blair. “The reason these companies became as big as they are is because they found that one drug that really worked and could drive growth to where they are now.”

Many of these blockbusters are known as small-molecule drugs which make up 90% of all medications sold. Typically when a small-molecule drug — which has a low molecular weight and is typically taken orally — loses it patent it can can also lose up 80% of its sales in one year according to Phipps.

But the upcoming sweep of patent expirations is also set to impact biologic therapies — a class of drugs developed from living materials such as blood proteins plants and microorganisms. These drugs are usually administered through an IV or an injection. Because they’re more complicated to replicate the pace of their diminishing sales is different than that of small-molecule drugs.

In the case of Humira — a biologic used to treat arthritis and other autoimmune conditions — the medication began facing competition from biosimilar alternatives last year. In 2023 sales of Humira fell fell 32% to $14 billion. More recently Humira sales continued to fall 9% to $2.3 billion in the three months ending March 31.

Now pharma giants are taking steps now to prepare for similar revenue losses when their patents start to expire in the next few years. But Big Pharma also has a plan in place — and a well-run playbook for delaying or offsetting impending generic competition.

The first play: File more patents

“Even six months of a $10 billion drug is worth a hell of a lot more than the first six months of a new therapy that’s launching” Phipps said. “Step one is always try to maximize what you have.”

Because drugs are patented years before they get regulatory approval and hit the market pharmaceutical companies try to extend their exclusivity rights as much as possible. Drug companies do this by filing not only patents on their medications but also on the manufacturing process and even how a drug is administered. All those patents add up — and can delay generic versions and biosimilars from entering the market.

But recently this strategy has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. “I don’t know if we’ll see quite as much of that [in the future] as we had in the past 10 years” Phipps said. In April the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the second time challenged what it called “junk” patents or improper patent listings in the Food and Drug Administration’s Orange Book — the official list of FDA-approved drugs.

Melissa Wasserman a professor at the University of Texas Austin who researches drug patent law said this is positive development. “Those patents that are listed in the Orange Book can have a blocking effect” Wasserman said. “You as a generic can’t come on until you basically deal with every patent that’s listed in the Orange Book for that drug.”

Another patenting strategy the companies deploy: Combine drugs then patent those new formulations. In one case Bristol Myers Squibb is losing several key patents in 2028 including its best-selling Opdivo. In 2023 the melanoma-fighting medication alone accounted for 20% of the company’s $45 billion in annual revenue.

In 2022 the company launched Opdualag a combination of Opdivo with the antibody relatlimab-rmbw after the combined drug was found to have increased efficacy for treating melanoma. It was “purely a patent extension technique” Phipps said although the combined medication does make it a bit easier to administer to patients. But sales of Opdualag skyrocketed 72% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024 reaching $206 million.

The second play: Offset losses with newer drugs

“Eventually all your patents run out and generic competition enters” said Mike Perrone a biotech specialist at healthcare management consulting firm Baird. What pharmaceutical companies turn to next he added involves relying on their internal pipelines.

After exhausting their options with patents pharmaceutical companies increase investment in their new and upcoming drugs to offset declining sales. But the timing has to be right given it takes a while for a new drug to reach blockbuster-status revenue.

AbbVie the maker of the world’s once best-selling drug Humira is a good example of this being pulled off properly. When the pharma giant lost exclusive rights to Humira last year sales of the drug fell 32%. But by preparing and launching new potential blockbusters a few years before the patent’s expiration the company has been able to offset Humira’s losses.

AbbVie’s Skyrizi a treatment for plaque psoriasis launched in 2019 saw its sales rise 48% year over year to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of Rinqov a treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis that also debuted in 2019 soared 59% to $1.1 billion.

Meanwhile Merck the maker of Keytruda — which took the title of the world’s best-selling drug from Humira last year with $25 billion in sales — is now deploying a similar strategy. The U.S. FDA first approved Keytruda in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then it’s received approval to treat several types of cancers including lung cancer and carcinoma. In the first quarter of 2024 Keytruda accounted for nearly 44% of Merck’s $15.8 billion in total sales.

With Merck’s patent set to expire in 2028 it’s perhaps no coincidence that this year the company is launching Winrevair a drug for adults who have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. About 1% of the global population has the condition.

One more play: Snap up smaller companies and outsource

In one last strategic move pharmaceutical companies also acquire smaller biotech startups to absorb their drug pipelines. In effect the move allows them to outsource drug research and development — reducing their own financial risk as blockbuster revenue streams dry up.

“[T]he strategy over the past few years had been to buy things that had already been approved and were on the market so you don’t take any risk” Baird’s Perrone said. But companies have become more aggressive as of late he added — and have started to acquire startups based just on clinical trial results.

Take for example Bristol-Myers Squibb which is set to lose patents for three medications this decade: Eliquis Revlimid and Opdivo. Collectively these drugs accounted for 62% of the company’s total first-quarter sales of $11.9 billion this year. Perhaps it’s no surprise that in April during the company’s quarterly earnings report BMS also touted several of its recent acquisitions: Karuna Therapeutics RayzeBio Mirati Therapeutics and an exclusive license agreement with SystImmune.

In another case Merck — facing the expiration of Keytruda’s patent in four years — highlighted last month how it’s expanding its pipeline and portfolio of drugs with the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics.

Ultimately pharmaceutical giants have had a long time to prepare their plays for expiring blockbusters. “This has always been part of the ecosystem in the biotech world” Phipps said. “You never have a true long-term outlook for something. You always have to be innovating.” In other words it’s business as usual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9kYXRhLW5ld3MvbWVyY2stY28taW5jLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLW1vbmRheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC1hMWQ1MDgzMy1jNTg1ZTZhMzQyMzbSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL2RhdGEtbmV3cy9tZXJjay1jby1pbmMtc3RvY2stcmlzZXMtbW9uZGF5LXN0aWxsLXVuZGVycGVyZm9ybXMtbWFya2V0LWExZDUwODMzLWM1ODVlNmEzNDIzNg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck & Co.

Winklevoss Capital (2012): The duo founded a company that provides angel investments to early-stage companies and entrepreneurs. It has invested in almost 100 projects and currently has 20 crypto-focused investments in its portfolio.

Bitcoin investment (2012 and 2013): In April 2013 the brothers announced they own approximately $11 million in Bitcoin through Winklevoss Capital. Some reports suggest they bought some of their Bitcoin for as little as $10 per coin. At that point the duo was rumored to own 1% of all the Bitcoin in circulation. Shortly after that announcement Bitcoin's price fell from $180 to $80 in a week -- the first of many dips on the crypto rollercoaster.

BitInstant (2013): The Harvard graduates announced their involvement in BitInstant one of the first American Bitcoin exchanges. Unfortunately Charlie Shrem the former CEO was later arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for operating an unlicensed money business. Prosecutors said he knowingly traded Bitcoin that had been used for illegal drug transactions and money laundering. BitInstant shut down later that year. The brothers would later sue Shrem in 2018 claiming Shrem stole Bitcoin from them. An undisclosed settlement was reached in 2019.

Foundation of Gemini (2014): Since the pair founded the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini it has built a reputation as one of the safest places to buy sell and store cryptocurrency. It was one of the first to be licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). This is significant because New York has some of the strictest crypto regulations in the U.S. and only a handful of platforms can operate there.

Bitcoin surge (2017): In December the price of Bitcoin peaked at over $18000. Its value has risen and fallen since then but the Winklevoss twins did not sell.

BlockFi investment (2019): Winklevoss Capital invested in BlockFi one of the first crypto lenders in the U.S. Now it is a crypto financial services company that also pays decent savings rates.

Nifty Gateway (2019): Gemini bought Nifty Gateway a platform for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) -- or Nifties as the company calls them. NFTs are unique digital collectibles often art or music which allow artists to profit from digital artwork. NFTs are another aspect of the blockchain world that has boomed in recent years.

Crypto credit cards (2021): Both BlockFi and Gemini have opened up waiting lists for crypto credit cards set to launch this year showing the brothers are again at the forefront of the industry. These crypto credit cards will allow you to earn rewards in Bitcoin and other digital currencies as well as giving potential trading discounts.

Bitcoin surge (2021): This has been the year Bitcoin reached extraordinary highs. It started the year valued at around $30000. By March it had risen to over $60000. The exact details of what the brothers own are unclear although we know they haven't sold much of their original investment. Forbes estimates they currently own 70000 Bitcoins as well as other digital assets.

What lessons can we learn from the Winklevoss twins?

The twins embraced the digital economy early and have made it clear they think Bitcoin is better than gold. From lawsuits to holding tight here's what we can learn from the Winklevoss story -- even if we don't have $11 million to invest in digital currencies tomorrow.

Invest for the long term. The Winklevoss twins have held on to their Bitcoin through the highs and lows. According to media reports the only time they sold any Bitcoin was to set up Gemini. They researched digital currencies and believe in the transformative power of this technology. And they think this is only the beginning for Bitcoin. A good takeaway from this is to invest in cryptocurrencies stocks or funds that you believe will perform well in the long run. That way you won't be as impacted if your assets fluctuate in the short term.

These days there are several reputable cryptocurrency exchanges where you can buy Bitcoin safely and cheaply.

The twins' first taste of crypto was with a man who later turned out to be a criminal and stole some of their coins. You can avoid that mistake. These days there are several reputable cryptocurrency exchanges where you can buy Bitcoin safely and cheaply. Live below your means. Even when the first Bitcoin peak took their assets to over a billion the brothers didn't rush out to buy flashy cars. In fact in 2018 only one of the brothers owned a car at all and it was bought secondhand. Sure Bitcoin has made some people into millionaires overnight. But there's a more dependable way to build wealth: Don't spend every cent you earn and invest money when you can. Putting money aside every month will help you to have a nest egg ready when you retire. You might even be able to retire early.

We're in the midst of a Bitcoin gold rush and it's easy to get caught up in the frenzy. But it's important to remember that cryptocurrency investments are highly volatile. And it's never a good idea to invest money you can't afford to lose. The Winklevoss twins show us how important it is to think long term. That way you avoid panic selling if your investments lose value or panic buying for fear you might miss the boat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhcnN0b29sc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9ibG9nLzMzNjA2NTQvdGhlLWhvdC10dWItbWV0YS1pcy1jb3JydXB0aW5nLXR3aXRjaC1hbmQtdGhlcmVzLW9ubHktb25lLXRoaW5nLXdlLWNhbi1kby1hYm91dC1pdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Hot Tub Meta Is Corrupting Twitch And There's Only One Thing We Can Do About It,"What we are seeing on Twitch right now is truly one of the most incredible gaming metas in history.

Originally Twitch was strictly meant for gaming. However on September 26th 2018 Twitch launched a ""Just Chatting"" category that really opened up the platform for a ton of new content. Right now it's Sunday afternoon and the Just Chatting category has 526000+ live viewers compared to Warzone's 160000+ live viewers.

Let me preface this blog by saying that there are two types of streamers on Twitch regardless of gender - those that care about their community + producing quality content vs. streamers that solely care about money and getting an easy buck. A perfect example of a streamer that cares about their community + producing quality content is MMA fighter Megan Anderson. She's been grinding for a while on Twitch and finally became a Twitch Partner (think of this as the blue checkmark for Twitch) last month.

I have become very good friends with Megan from casting the ""Baddest MFer in Verdansk"" UFC Kill Race Tournament with Robbie Fox.

Now on the other side of the Twitch spectrum is the Hot Tub Meta and long-time streamers on the platform are not liking it.

Since the dawn of Twitch simps have held the line for their favorite female streamers - look at Pokimane's army for a perfect example. These hot tub streamers are pulling insane numbers of concurrent viewers subscribers ($4.99/month) and donations all for streaming in a bikini and a hot tub. Most of them have subscriber/donation goals that if they get X amount of dollars they will change bikinis (off cam of course).

Other known Twitch creators have also joined the party and began poking fun at the current state of Twitch -

I don't see this shift changing anytime soon because Twitch viewership is up for less time streamed. And let's be honest the more money Twitch makes off the hot tub meta the more they'll let this style of streaming continue.

If you can't beat 'em join em and Barstool is all about adapting.

The Answer: Twitch NEEDS Hot Tub Glenny Balls and they need him now.

Glenny isn't the hot tub streamer we deserve but he's the hot tub streamer that we need.

If anyone is bored and wants to do ""field work"" let me know your thoughts about this current Twitch meta.

The Just Chatting section on Twitch has always been a hot topic of conversation for streamers and viewers because of how far some creators stretch the community guidelines on the platform.

In recent weeks the hot tub ‘meta’ has taken over the section where streamers will sit in a hot tub – or something similar – in just their swimwear and chat to viewers. Some streamers have criticized Twitch as a result believing that some have pushed the boundaries a little too far and the streams have created a grey area in the rules.

The trend has also given way to plenty of parody streams too with one streamer using Star Wars figures to replicate a hot tub stream and another sitting in a bucket of water. Now though one streamer has been banned following their take on the streams.

Twitch Twitch’s hot tub meta is the latest Just Chatting trend.

During his April 24 stream Australian League of Legends streamer udysof mocked the hot tub streams by sitting in a paddling pool in a bra and other underwear leaning into the camera in a suggestive manner.

Like some other Just Chatting streamers do and have been slammed for doing so he’d also written the names of subscribers over his body.

While his viewers may have thought the whole thing was funny Horne was hit with a temporary ban after the hilarity was over.

“Got banned for 1 day no more hot tub streams” he tweeted afterwards with a frowny face emoji attached. Though he did follow it up with a joking “I’ll be back” post too.

Some fans questioned how he’d been hit with a suspension given that they believed he didn’t go as far as some others but Twitch very rarely reveals the exact reason why.

It was likely because of the underwear he was wearing seeing as it wasn’t a swimsuit but rather just a typical bra. But again that’s one of the grey areas that streamers have criticized Twitch for not clearing up.

Hard Rock International the Seminole tribe has been kicking tires all over town for a casino acquisition.

They were reportedly close on Planet Hollywood but now we hear the tribe’s in advanced talks to purchase Bally’s on the Las Vegas Strip.

Hard Rock International bought back the rights to use the Hard Rock brand for a casino resort in Las Vegas from Juniper Capital in May 2020. (There’s a Hard Rock Cafe on The Strip but there’s no casino so it doesn’t count.)

Juniper purchased the Hard Rock casino in 2018 from Brookfield Asset Management.

There will be a quiz.

We’ve heard the Seminoles were pretty far down the path of buying Planet Hollywood but hit a snag related to the Zappos Theater. Namely Planet Hollywood’s owner Caesars Entertainment doesn’t want to give it up.

What would it mean if the Seminoles are buying Bally’s as we’re told they are?

Well it would lay waste to the theory Bally’s will be rebranded to Horseshoe. Caesars can’t rebrand something it doesn’t own.

We were curious why it was taking Caesars so long to do the rebrand given: 1) Caesars sold the Bally’s brand to Twin River now called Bally’s Corp. and 2) Bally’s Corp. recently purchased Tropicana and could very well rebrand it to Bally’s assuming there isn’t another one on The Strip.

The rumored sale of Bally’s to Hard Rock International helps explain the rebrand foot-dragging.

It’s worth noting Bally’s is nearly 50 years old (it was formerly MGM Grand). That’s about 1050 in Las Vegas resort years. What if Hard Rock demolished the place and built a big-ass guitar hotel on the site like the one in Florida?

Chatter about Las Vegas casino mergers and acquisitions is at an all-time high.

Caesars Entertainment has a huge debt load and company officials have publicly said they’ll sell one or more Las Vegas casinos.

Apparently there’s been a lot of interest in Cromwell but the company isn’t selling.

In somewhat related news confirmation of another sale of a major off-Strip resort is expected soon. We’ll share when we can share of course.

What we can say is a clear theme is emerging as neither buyer owns a casino in Las Vegas at the moment.

Until then lots of big announcements in the works and lots of new casino chips to collect. There are Circa chips (opened in late 2020) Mohegan Sun chips (at Virgin which opened recently) Resorts World chips (opening June 24 2021) and possibly Bally’s chips at Tropicana and Hard Rock chips at the former Bally’s.

The usual disclaimer applies: The rumor of a Bally’s sale to Hard Rock International is unconfirmed (nor will it be prior to an official announcement as Caesars Entertainment is a public company and won’t comment on rumors). We share industry chatter we think you’ll find of interest. Things change so don’t get your manties in a bunch if this particular rumor doesn’t pan out. We are a blog not a soothsayer. Probably.

Las Vegas is in a constant state of flux and we look forward to your being fluxed up here again soon.

We have lately been increasing our activities in the U.S. market and hold an important position with materials and solutions for the semiconductor industry.



Who invented it?



The telephone videogames chewing gum and cola – all these products which we are used to in our daily lives were invented or made market-ready in the land of opportunity. It’s no wonder that the world’s first computer chip the Intel 4004 first went into production there in 1971.



And this trend has continued. In particular companies from Silicon Valley which is known as the “cradle of technology” continuously churn out their technical achievements. Tech companies such as Apple Facebook Google and eBay as well as leading semiconductor manufacturers are based in the United States. Five U.S. companies including industry leader Intel rank among the top ten in the chip industry. Micron Technology Qualcomm Broadcom and Texas Instruments also rank near the top.



As I explained in my blogpost on the semiconductor market in Asia Asia-Pacific may be the world’s largest semiconductor market. However the Americas rank second. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics this region accounted for US$ 95 billion in semiconductor sales in 2020.



Semiconductors are the key to success



The semiconductor sector has been an important pillar of the U.S. industry for many years. Thanks to technologies such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and wireless networks like 5G demand for chips will remain high after seeing a dynamic acceleration during the pandemic. And politicians are also helping to support this industry. For example at the beginning of this year the U.S. government announced its intention to ensure that the United States remains an attractive production location and to make the country less dependent on imports from Asia in particular. Among other things U.S. President Joe Biden intends to pass a law to provide US$ 50 billion for the chip industry in order to in the future prevent the kinds of bottlenecks in chip production that were seen in the automotive industry at the start of the year. The industry association SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) had previously requested more government money for the U.S. semiconductor industry for this reason.



The U.S. government isn’t the sole driver moving the country forward as a semiconductor hub; companies are also getting involved. For example in November 2020 Apple revealed their own new computer chip M1 with which the tech giant will replace the Intel processors that it has been using in its products for more than two decades. The Taiwanese company TSMC intends to invest US$ 12 billion in the construction of a new chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona. Samsung is also considering investing tens of billions of U.S. dollars in the construction of a factory in Texas for the production of three-nanometer chips.



However the United States and the companies based there rely not only on investments but also on the education of highly qualified employees. Education in STEM subjects is therefore strongly promoted at U.S. universities. I would love to see Europe and Germany join the US in strongly promoting curiosity and STEM for our future generations of scientists.

The construction is set to begin this year with the production of DRAM chips with 10-nanometer class process technologies slated for 2024.Nanya is the world's fourth-largest DRAM chipmaker holding a 2.9% market share in the DRAM market as of the fourth quarter of 2020 according to market research firm TrendForce. There is a considerable gap between Nanya and industry leaders Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. with 42.1% and 29.5% market shares respectively.Nanya is likely to have decided on a large-scale investment because the DRAM market is growing at an extremely fast pace -- making it difficult for Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to dominate the market which is projected to grow from $65.3 billion last year to $104.4 billion in 2022.Nanya plans to utilize extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology to narrow its gap with the market leaders.In the NAND flash segment US chipmakers Western Digital and Micron have been pushing to expand their foothold in the market as they both consider acquiring the world’s No. 2 NAND flash company Kioxia Holdings.As of Q4 2020 Samsung Electronics was in the lead with a 32.9% market share in the NAND flash market followed by Kioxia with 19.5% Western Digital with 14.4% SK Hynix with 11.6% and Micron with 11.2%.If Western Digital merges with Kioxia then the company would exceed Samsung Electronics' market share and position itself as the industry frontrunner.Meanwhile US-based semiconductor foundry GlobalFoundries Inc. has been stepping up investment despite the global foundry market's supply shortage.Industry watchers say the US administration's initiative to foster semiconductors served as a driving force behind the company's decision.GlobalFoundries plans to inject around $1.4 billion this year to increase production in its US Singapore and Germany-based plants. The company is also eyeing an initial public offering in 2022 with its enterprise value expected to reach $20 billion.GlobalFoundries used to be the world's second-largest foundry trailing industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). But the company lost some footing in 2017 when it gave up 7-nanometer processing because of the excessive cost involved.Last year the firm's market share dropped to 7% making it the world's fourth-biggest foundry.While second-tier chipmakers are gearing up Samsung Electronics -- currently the world's No. 1 DRAM and NAND flash maker and the world's second-largest foundry -- has yet to lay out clear countermeasures.Based on its annual investment plan Samsung Electronics is expected to invest around 30 trillion won ($27 billion) in facility investments but the company has yet to disclose plans regarding its US-based foundry expansion and additional Pyeongtaek fab investment.Jung-soo Hwang at hjs@hankyung.com Danbee Lee edited this article.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnL3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 “Picks and Shovels”-Type Semiconductor Companies: Lam Research (LRCX) ASML Holding NV (ASML) Micro ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://dollarsandsense.sg/semiconductor-companies/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnL3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Throughout my career at Microsoft I’ve been proud to play a part in enabling a safer healthier more sustainable and fairer future for our planet by supporting social entrepreneurship. It has helped me align my personal purpose with the purpose of Microsoft.

We only do well when the world does well.

Microsoft’s Global Social Entrepreneurship Program was created in early 2020 after we asked ourselves how we could further empower purpose-driven social enterprises that measure success not just by the profit they generate but by the good they do. We know that technology plus purpose is powerful and lifts us all up.

Over a year later I am pleased to share that we now have more than 100 social impact organizations participating from every market working toward every single one of the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Today I’d like to tell you about three in particular.

Vector Center

Vector Center is helping companies institutions and governments navigate profound water and systemic risks by providing real-time contextualized intelligence about water climate and intersecting global threats to help inform responses.

As J. Carl Ganter Vector Center CEO and recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation Centennial Innovation Award put it “To avoid serious imminent disruptions for business people and the environment the world needs nothing less than a coordinated data-informed global water movement.”

And we need it now. Climate change continues to be the biggest single threat to all our futures.

But Ganter is also an optimist. So am I.

He believes we are entering an exciting era of accelerated innovation and problem-solving where advancements in technology like machine learning are making it possible to work smarter spot trends faster and predict responses better.

The organization draws on its decades of experience and its revolutionary Perception Reality Engine™ running on Microsoft’s Azure platform to uniquely combine state-of-the-art satellite data social sentiment analysis and on-the-ground investigative research.

It’s also been wonderful to see how its network of purpose-driven innovators all at the forefront of sustainability analytics and global trends has developed a creative collaborative relationship with Microsoft as we work together to meet our common sustainability goals.

Circuit Clinical

I’d now like to introduce you to Dr. Irfan Khan.

While he was the director of the electrophysiology lab at Mercy Hospital in Buffalo New York Dr. Khan made an important realization: Researchers need a diverse slate of clinical trial participants that fully represent the human population and people from all backgrounds need access to the latest treatments.

As a result he made the decision in 2016 to leave medical practice and focus on solving the problem. He founded Circuit Clinical which works to bring together a network of health systems serving diverse populations to provide clinical research as a care option for patients.

I’ll let Dr. Khan tell you more about it:

“Circuit Clinical’s core belief is that patients prefer to learn about clinical research from healthcare providers they already know and trust. That’s why our team is integrated within our network to deliver clinical research where it matters most to patients – their own doctors’ offices. Since its founding Circuit Clinical has brought together a network representing 180 doctors more than 30 medical practices and a nationally accredited cancer center with direct access to more than 2 million patients who may qualify for clinical trials.”

1.8 billion people will soon be living with absolute water scarcity. In urban environments and fast-growing towns and cities in Africa water rationing and shortages caused by aging infrastructure and commercial losses limit household consumption and service even as demand grows.

At UPEPO founder Kevin Kihara and his team are helping to solve this problem of water loss by integrating Azure-based Internet of Things solutions that help achieve water efficiency conservation and management outcomes.

Most importantly these solutions are customized for emerging markets and Africa where this issue is critical and where high capital expenditure is a barrier to technology.

Like most social entrepreneurs Kevin’s ambition to make an impact is both immense and inspiring going well beyond the issue of water loss in his home country of Kenya.

“Our long-term plan is to go across Africa and the Middle East focusing on cities eventually hoping to have our devices installed on over 300000 devices” he says. “Our objective is save every last drop. And through water conservation we can address the issues of climate change which is putting a great strain on our water resources.”

Conclusion:

I hope you are inspired by these amazing stories as I am.

This was followed by another report that Google is planning to establish a regional data center in Israel for its cloud computing services that could see hundreds of millions of dollars invested in local infrastructure. Google refused to comment on the news leaving it shrouded in secrecy like Microsoft's Israeli ventures.





While such investments may seem benign or apolitical on the surface the complete lack of transparency surrounding them speaks of disregard for basic corporate social responsibility and ethical principles for multiple reasons.

The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights emphasise that businesses have human rights responsibilities under international standards. The guiding principles oblige companies around the globe to conduct due diligence and mitigate any harmful impact of their activities. Those guiding principles seem to have been ignored or flouted in these investments.

Microsoft is purportedly committed to protecting democratic freedoms and has pledged publicly not to aid in the encroachment of such freedoms. But in secretly choosing Israel for their investments these two tech giants are either knowingly or inadvertently investing in fueling sustaining and whitewashing an unjust and inherently destabilising status quo of suppression and subjugation.



On the most basic level these substantial investments will increase the Israeli government's tax revenue which is used to subsidise ever-expanding settlements and maintain Israel's military subjugation of Palestinians.

Furthermore making such generous unconditional investments bolsters a delusion of normalcy that helps Israel maintain its occupation settlement expansion and the systematic subjugation immiseration and abuse of Palestinians. Despite this reality it suggests that Israel can still be attractive and appealing to giant transnational corporations.

As a result Israel feels even more invincible and emboldened to escalate and accelerate its oppression of Palestinians unconstrained and unafraid of any consequences.



And this isn't the first time Microsoft has turned a blind eye to Israel's oppression or tried to turn a profit from it. In 2019 Microsoft was slammed for funding the Israeli firm AnyVision that surveils West Bank Palestinians for the Israeli military using facial recognition technology. Similarly last Wednesday the far-right Israeli government awarded a $1.2-billion contract to Google and Amazon for building local cloud storage server centres in what is called Project Nimbus.



Under the deal the two companies would contribute substantially to enhancing the very state infrastructure used to oppress Palestinians including the infamous Unit 8200 - the Israeli military division that relies on cutting edge technology to spy on Palestinians in order to blackmail them into collaborating with it against other Palestinians.





The recently announced major investments by Google and Microsoft further whitewash Israel's image and give it more PR triumphs to legitimise the status quo by fueling the trope of Israel as an unparalleled beacon of hope in the Middle East a benign force a light for the region. They feed into the narrative of Israel as a successful startup nation to be admired and emulated.

Microsoft and Google are further rewarding Israel by bolstering its tech hegemony in the region giving it even more power and leverage. In doing so they are also ignoring Israel's history of being the biggest hub for government-sanctioned hacking and spyware startups in the region.

This raises a serious concern over whether Microsoft and Google have taken sufficient precautionary measures to ensure that Israel - a country that conducts extensive surveillance under the pretext of national security - would not use its direct access to their servers to conduct spyware attacks or cyber surveillance operations not least against Palestinians.



This is all the more concerning given that section 19 of Israel's Privacy Protection Act 5741–1981 gives an exception from criminal liability in the event of breaching and seizing data if the perpetrator is Israel's police military intelligence (Aman) Shin Bet or Mossad.

The situation is not without precedent: Last year twitter opened a regional headquarters in the UAE prompting an outcry from human rights defenders activists and intellectuals. They pointed out that Saudi authorities were able to identify capture and torture to death a prominent Saudi dissident Turki Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Jasser allegedly using information shared by Twitter's Dubai office.





The responsible course of action for tech giants endowed with enormous resources and influence is to make their investments conditional on Israel showing progress towards upholding the dignity of Palestinians and enacting substantial reforms where their rights are concerned. Without these guarantees the two companies should refrain from making such controversial investments altogether.

Google and Microsoft have other prominent choices in the region with high tech potential and a dire need for investments that can be a meaningful force for good and change.

Tunisia for example is widely praised as the only true democracy in the Arab world after the 2011 Arab Spring but its economic development has been unfortunately stagnant. Tunisia has a rising startup ecosystem where it ranked second in Africa in the 2019 Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI). It also has a highly educated and young workforce yearning for opportunities to prove their talents.

Relocating those major investments to Tunisia could unleash its untapped potential and give the country a solid opportunity to develop and become a success story in the region. This would uphold the purported values of Google and Microsoft and fulfill their social responsibility to be a positive force for change rather than a tool for a repressive regime.

Chromium Edge also comes with an excellent built-in PDF reader. However until now Chromium Edge has been somewhat lacking in that department especially when compared to the legacy version.

In January Microsoft revealed that it was working on a new search tool for Edge’s PDF reader. As per the experimental flags and new features spotted in the test builds Microsoft now appears to be working on a more capable in-browser PDF reader.

One feature I’m particularly excited about is “pick up from where you left off”. Currently when you open PDF documents in Edge or Chrome that you stopped reading at a specific page they open to the beginning of the file. If you close the file you’ll have to manually go to where you left off.

In the next version of Microsoft Edge which is expected to arrive later this year you can soon resume reading from where you last closed the document.

Better text selection in PDF documents

In Edge 89 Microsoft enabled a feature that enables a more consistent text selection experience in PDF documents.

With version 91 Microsoft is planning to make additional improvements to this feature so you can get a smoother and more consistent text selection experience across PDF documents.

Scrolling improvements

Microsoft Edge update will also ship with multiple scrolling improvements. For example you can soon scroll through each page or two pages when you view documents in a two-page layout.

Likewise Microsoft is testing performance improvements to enable a smoother scroll experience in documents. This should hide white bars that appear when you scroll through long PDF files.

Another new feature will allow users to open optional thumbnails sidebar experience which is already available in Chrome. This will allow users to navigate through the documents using thumbnails which will appear on the left sidebar.

PDF with signatures

Microsoft Edge users will be able to validate the signatures on PDF files.

Some features are already live in the Canary builds and Microsoft is expected to detail the scrolling improvements later this year."

Is it in COVID-19 vaccines?,"DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 77-year-old woman. I am extremely allergic to mercury and all products that have it as a preservative such as lotions makeup etc. My pharmacist made sure my flu shot was safe for me to get. Can you tell me if the COVID-19 vaccines contain mercury? I am also concerned about the shingles vaccine. -- D.K.

ANSWER: Thiomersal is a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines such as the multidose flu vaccines. However there is no thiomersal in either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. There is also no thiomersal in the available shingles vaccines.

DEAR DR. ROACH: I have started to do some cooking. Some recipes simply call for “salt” some for “sea salt” and others call for “kosher salt.” Are there any differences among these from a health standpoint? -- R.V.

ANSWER: All of these salts (as well as pink Himalayan salt which people write to me about) are comprised of almost-pure sodium chloride. There may be slight differences in trace minerals they contain. Iodine may be added to table salt but usually not to Himalayan or Kosher salt which contain very little iodine. Iodine is important to the developing fetus. Otherwise they are the same chemically.

The main difference among the types of salt besides trace mineral content is the size of the crystal. Finer crystals have a different taste from coarser ones and the amount of sodium per teaspoon can vary dramatically based on how the salt is ground.

Experienced chefs know how much of what type of salt to use based on the type of recipe and the taste they want. From a medical perspective they are essentially the same and I would encourage you to experiment but not overdo it. Very high sodium intake increases blood pressure may increase stroke risk and also makes kidney stones more likely.

Guidance on Second Pfizer Vaccine Doses,"Walgreens has inoculated hundreds of thousands of Americans against Covid-19 this year using the vaccine developed by Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. But the pharmacy chain has not been following guidance from federal health officials about the timing of second doses.

People are supposed to get two doses three weeks apart. Walgreens however separated them by four weeks because that made it faster and simpler for the company to schedule appointments.

There is no evidence that separating the doses by an extra week decreases the vaccine’s effectiveness. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a three-week gap the agency says it is acceptable to separate the doses by up to six weeks if necessary.

But Walgreens’s decision which it didn’t publicly announce confused some customers and caught the attention of federal health officials. Kate Grusich a spokeswoman for the C.D.C. said the agency had asked Walgreens to stop using a longer-than-recommended period between doses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjUvc2Vjb25kLWRvc2UtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1tb2Rlcm5hLWRlbnZlci_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L3NlY29uZC1kb3NlLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtbW9kZXJuYS1kZW52ZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trouble getting your second COVID-19 vaccine dose?

Centura Health is setting aside 2500 Moderna doses for patients who need an “orphan” second dose “in an effort to ensue community members can be fully vaccinated and not slip through the cracks” spokesman Kevin Massey said in a statement Sunday. The clinic is aimed at patients whose initial vaccine provider cannot administer the second dose.

Patients must have received their first dose of the Moderna vaccine before April 2 to be eligible for Thursday’s clinic Massey said and should bring their vaccination card from their first dose with them.

“Most vaccine providers do not have the workflow to accommodate orphan second dose vaccinations” Massey said in the statement.

Pfizer/BioNTech

The vaccines taskforce secured 40m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine the first coronavirus shot to be approved by the medicines regulator. The NHS vaccine rollout began on 8 December 2020 when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme. This is one of the cutting-edge mRNA vaccines that smuggles the genetic instructions for making the coronavirus spike protein into muscle cells. Coronavirus is covered in spike proteins so making human cells manufacture it primes the immune system to attack the virus should it invade.

Oxford/AstraZeneca

With 100m doses on order the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is a major pillar of the national immunisation programme. The first shot outside trials was given on 4 January 2021. The vaccine is based on a virus that causes common colds in chimps. The virus is engineered to ensure it cannot replicate in humans and modified further to include the genetic instructions to make the coronavirus spike protein.

NIH/Moderna

The second mRNA vaccine to reach the market joined the country’s vaccination programme less than three weeks ago on 7 April. The government has ordered 17m doses of the Moderna jab. In response to the very rare blood clots seen in some people who receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine people under 30 in the UK are offered Moderna or Pfizer shots instead.

Novavax

The UK medicines regulator is expected to approve the Novavax vaccine imminently. It is known as a protein subunit vaccine and incorporates a lab-made coronavirus spike protein and an ingredient called an adjuvant that makes the body’s immune response stronger. The UK has ordered 60m doses. While Novavax is a US company supplies for the mass vaccination programme will be made in Stockton-on-Tees with the final “fill and finish” step at GlaxoSmithKline’s plant in Barnard Castle County Durham.

Janssen/Johnson & Johnson

The UK medicines regulator is conducting a rolling review of the Janssen vaccine which is based on similar “viral vector” technology to the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot. US health officials lifted a short pause in administering the Janssen vaccine on Saturday after deciding that the benefits outweighed the low risk of blood clots that resemble those seen in small numbers of people who received the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot. A major advantage of the Janssen vaccine is that it requires only one dose while the others need two. The UK vaccines taskforce has ordered 30m doses.

Others

If it performs well in final stage trials Valneva’s vaccine which uses an inactivated whole virus and an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response could be approved for use as a booster this autumn. The government has secured up to 100m doses. Further orders are in for 60m doses of a GSK/Sanofi vaccine and 50m doses of another mRNA vaccine from the German company CureVac. Both are still in trials.",,,

According to a case report published in BMJ Journals three doctors from London offered a recent account of a 21-year-old man who landed in intensive care—and was diagnosed with severe biventricular heart failure—due to excessive consumption of energy drinks.

The patient reported a number of ailments that had been troubling him for four months including shortness of breath on exertion breathlessness while lying down and weight loss along with heart palpitations bouts of digestion issues and tremors. His declining health left him so weak that he was forced to quit the university he'd been attending.

While he was initially being considered for two organ transplants—heart and kidney (caused by an unrelated condition)—his cardiovascular disease has greatly improved with medication as well as eliminating energy drinks from his diet. So how many beverages was he consuming? Roughly four 500-milliliters cans a day for nearly two years. The study authors stated that each serving contained 160 milligrams of caffeine.

15 Underrated Weight Loss Tips That Actually Work

And here's how that number compares to other popular caffeinated beverages: The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) reports that a 12-ounce soft drink contains between 30 to 40 milligrams of this stimulant an 8-ounce cup of tea typically contains 30 to 50 milligrams and an 8-ounce cup of coffee holds anywhere between 80 to 100 milligrams.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that even though these highly-caffeinated beverages may enhance alertness these stimulating products—either energy drinks or energy shots—also come with a list of potentially serious side effects. Here we offer four more health complications that may be caused by downing too many energy drinks and then don't miss The Most Dangerous Ingredients in Energy Drinks According to Dietitians.

High blood pressure.

In one study that was published in the Journal of the American Heart Association researchers offered participants a pick-me-up beverage—some were given an energy drink (which contained up to 320 milligrams of caffeine for every 32-ounces as well as B-vitamins and the protein taurine) while others were handed a placebo drink (a mixture of carbonated water lime juice and cherry flavoring).

The authors discovered that the volunteers who consumed the energy drink showed an increased QT interval (a measurement of time it takes for the ventricles in the heart to beat again) and higher blood pressure levels up to four hours later. An irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) and high blood pressure (hypertension) could lead to other life-threatening heart events.

Insomnia.

During a four-year study conducted by sports scientists from Spain male and female athletes were instructed to drink a particular beverage before playing in a game or competition. While some of the volunteers consumed an energy drink others drank a placebo cocktail. The findings which were published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that the football players hockey players climbers and swimmers who guzzled energy drinks displayed enhanced performance between 3% and 7% compared to the placebo drinkers.

However these men and women also suffered from insomnia—a sleep disorder defined by the Sleep Foundation as having difficulty falling asleep sleeping throughout the night or not sleeping as long as you would like in the morning. They also reported nervousness and a heightened level of stimulation for hours afterward.

Mental health issues.

Since energy drinks are promoted as having the ability to boost mental performance researchers from University of Western Australia Perth decided to find out if this perk came at the expense of any mental functions. As it turns out it did. Using data from a population study questionnaire the authors discovered that men who became energy drink consumers during the two-year research period reported elevated feelings of stress depression and anxiety. Interestingly this relationship was not seen among women.

Poor decision making.

In order to establish any possible connection between energy drinks and risk-taking investigators from Johns Hopkins reviewed the responses from an online survey filled out by more than 870 adults ages 18 through 28. According to the results which were published in the Journal of Caffeine Research the participants who drank at least one energy beverage each week were twice as likely to smoke cigarettes as well as more than twice as likely to use illicit drugs (such as cocaine). Other risky behaviors were reported including having unprotected sex with someone who wasn't their spouse (63%) driving without a seatbelt (53%) and driving while intoxicated (30%).6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

What can you do to increase energy levels without resorting to energy drinks?

If you're looking for more stamina throughout the day Jessica Cording MS RD CDN INHC author of The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress & Anxiety and host of the podcast ""Drama-Free Healthy Living with Jess Cording"" says the solution can likely be found by examining your diet and lifestyle.

""When a patient says they have been or are interested in using energy drinks we'll talk about making sure they're eating to support stable energy by having a combination of protein fat and carbs that keeps their blood sugar on an even keel—a big factor in energy levels"" she says. Being properly hydrated can also help the body fight daytime fatigue she adds.

""I'll also put on my health coach hat and talk with them about other factors such as exercise sleep and stress.

Over the next six-and-half hours late into the night the Hong Kong-based bankers worked frantically with dealers in New York Tokyo London and San Francisco to match buy and sell orders in the world's largest-ever block trade at HK$114.17 billion (US$14.7 billion). On offer was 2 per cent of China's most valuable company Tencent Holdings.

The seller Naspers of South Africa was cashing in on one of the most successful venture capital investments of all time to finance its forays into other digital businesses. At its sale price the Cape Town-based company had notched up a return of over 7000 times on its investment based on calculations by South China Morning Post.

Finding buyers for the block about nine times more than the average daily traded volume over the past 12 months was no mean feat because a clumsy exit from the heaviest weighted stock on the Hang Seng Index would potentially set off a calamitous crash not just in Tencent's shares but also for the world's third-largest capital market. Coming hot on the heels of fire sales in technology stocks in the wake of Archegos Capital's implosion and heightened antitrust scrutiny in China the timing made it one of the most challenging deals to pull off in the history of finance.

Tencent's share price from 2018 to 2021

To help clinch the deal Naspers secretly briefed a small group of money managers 24 hours before the divestment. All in US$60 billion worth of orders were queued up for the Tencent block that night including about 10 for around US$1 billion each according to people familiar with the matter.

Tencent's shares which closed at HK$629.50 before Naspers' Prosus unit announced its sale never fell below HK$600 in the days since keeping buyers well in the money above their HK$595 purchase price. The successful sale also underscored the depth and abundance of liquidity in Hong Kong's capital pool enough to rival US and European markets.

Prosus chief financial officer Basil Sgourdos expects Tencent's stock.to continue to rise in value

Story continues

""That's a great and unique position for Hong Kong and one it can build off going forward"" Naspers' financial director Basil Sgourdos said in an interview with the Post.

Naspers' US$32 million bet on Tencent in 2001 for a 46.5 per cent stake was valued at US$164 billion in 2017 a fortune that helped to finance the newspaper publisher's transformation into an internet conglomerate. Naspers sold 2 per cent of Tencent in March 2018 at HK$405 per share ahead of a 45 per cent price plunge to HK$259 over the next seven months that took another eight months to claw back.

Fast forward to 2021 and Shenzhen-based Tencent faces a crackdown by Chinese regulators determined to break up the country's internet monopolies. Some investors worry that this latest sale by Tencent's largest shareholder presages another sell-off. Most stock analysts say that is unlikely and 93 per cent of the 67 analysts who cover Tencent recommend investors ""buy"" the stock.

""History never simply repeats itself"" said Tencent analysts at Chinese bank CICC.

Prosus Naspers' global internet investment arm and the holder of the Tencent stake since 2019 is adamant that the future of the Chinese internet behemoth remains bright and has committed to holding onto its remaining Tencent stake for at least three years.

""We think there is more value to come"" said Sgourdos who is also Prosus' chief financial officer.

That being said Prosus was eager to take advantage of buoyant markets to fill its war chest for acquisitions announcing two weeks after its divestment an US$80 million acquisition of the European online-trading group BUX.

""Even in times of volatility investors want exposure to China tech"" said Alex Abagian co-head of equity capital markets in the region at Morgan Stanley which tops investment banking league tables for large equity sales in Asia.

Ahead of the expiry of Prosus' lock-up following the 2018 sale some investors signalled they wanted to buy. Sgourdos who oversaw the 2018 sale considered his options.

""We wanted to do a quick transaction and move on with life"" he said which meant a block sale rather than dribbling shares through the market or entering bilateral talks with other investors.

Prosus rehired Citigroup and Morgan Stanley who had worked on its 2018 sale. Goldman Sachs replaced Bank of America in the line up given its ranking in the league tables and after BofA's James Fleming defected to Citi.

Together they decided to take a small group of investors into their confidence a process known as wall-crossing. For flash sales wall-crossing gives portfolio managers time to win approval for big-ticket purchases from headquarters sometimes located in a different time zone and provides the seller feedback from investors on what they would be willing to pay.

Prosus also sought to minimise the potential shock to the market as happened in 2018. Prosus and its bankers were confident that Hong Kong had enough liquidity to absorb such a large transaction.

Mainland China's investors had been able to trade Hong Kong-listed stocks since 2014 via the Stock Connect cross-border channel linking the city's bourse with Shanghai and Shenzhen. The resulting influx of mainland Chinese money into Hong Kong has nearly doubled the value of trading to HK$32 trillion last year. Still 2 per cent of Tencent in one fell swoop was roughly equal to seven days of trading on average the same ratio as in 2018.

""Hong Kong has developed by leaps and bounds in terms of the exchange's ability to draw in all pockets of global capital"" said Phyllis Wang a managing director in Goldman Sachs' ECM syndicate team. Goldman ranks second in Asia Pacific equity sales so far this year.

As Sgourdos pondered when to press the launch button one challenge was picking the best date. The company's lock-up from its 2018 sale expired on March 22 and Tencent reported its earnings on March 24 ahead of three non-trading days in Hong Kong over the Easter holidays. Another consideration was Hong Kong's higher stamp duty kicks in on August 1. Prosus picked the aftermarket hours of April 7.

Tencent shares fell 3.8 per cent on April 7. Prosus decided not to nickel-and-dime investors since the stock had risen more than 162 fold from Tencent's initial public offering in 2004 and pushed ahead.

Some of the bankers were nervous. They pitched the sale below the technically important HK$600 level to grab investors' attention from the get-go.

The sale launched at 4.55pm after the market had closed in Hong Kong. Terms sheets flashed on investors' screens offering stock between HK$575 and HK$595 a share. Sales traders hit the phones encouraging their best clients to buy.

One of the bankers involved in the deal described the process as ""ruthless"" and ""meticulous"" as the team hunted for investors from Tokyo through London to the east and west coast of the US.

The wall-crossing had generated orders for roughly three-quarters of the block at the lower end of that price range creating the impression of a supply shortage. The tactic worked and within 20 minutes the bankers had amassed enough demand for all of the stock.

From then on the banks worked to boost the sale price. Unusually the teams were confident enough to narrow the price range to between HK$585 and HK$595 midway through the sale. Most of the investors who had pitched low hurriedly raised their offer prices with only roughly a few billion dollars worth of orders falling away.

Over 450 buyers held up their hands for Tencent shares that night more than the 300 in 2018 with China-domiciled investors making up most of the difference. Between 60 and 65 per cent of the book came from Asia-based investors or the Asian offices of global firms and roughly a third from the US.

""Hong Kong markets have changed dramatically over the past few years not just from significant southbound flows but also Chinese investors' participation in Hong Kong transactions"" said Harish Raman head of Citigroup's Asia Pacific equity capital markets syndicate team. Citi ranks second in Asia Pacific ex-Japan IPOs so far this year.

The sale closed at HK$595 a share before midnight at the top end of the range and a 5.5 per cent discount to the April 7 closing price in the market narrower than the 7.8 per cent discount in 2018. After the sale Prosus still holds 28.9 per cent of Tencent as the Chinese company's largest single shareholder. Tencent's founder and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng is the second-biggest shareholder with a 7.4 per cent stake.

When bankers divvied up shares between investors across the next three hours they placed half in the hands of 10 institutions and 70 per cent with the top 20 hoping that concentrating shares in the hands of buy-and-hold investors would buoy the aftermarket. About a third of the buyers were long-term investors a greater proportion than in 2018 including sovereign wealth funds and existing Tencent and Naspers' shareholders. Hedge funds and index trackers also took part in the deal.

Tencent shares fell 1.5 per cent on April 8 as the market digested Prosus' divestment but stayed above the sale price before rising 0.08 per cent a day later. Bankers were jubilant.

The sale was a stand-out even in a banner year for deal-making. Globally block trades have swollen 181 per cent so far this year to a record US$59 billion according to Refinitiv.

Prosus paid roughly US$100 million in costs including bankers' fees foreign exchange and US$14.7 million in stamp duty. The banks' fees of about 30 basis points of the deal's value roughly US$44 million reflect their ""best efforts"" rather than any guarantee that they would sell all the shares known as hard underwriting according to two people familiar with the matter.

The sale secured Morgan Stanley and Goldman's positions as leaders in arranging block trades across the region while Citi's participation pushed Credit Suisse out of third place Refinitiv data showed. The three banks' market share swelled by between 2.6 and 15.7 percentage points bolstering their bragging rights and making it more likely they will win mandates in future.

Prosus already one of the largest technology investors in the world took home US$14.6 billion in net proceeds from the sale to plough into food delivery classifieds digital payments and online education that have all boomed during the coronavirus pandemic. The company which does not have to pay capital gains tax on the divestment under Dutch law is likely to spend half of the proceeds on acquisitions and the rest on share buy-backs said ABN Amro analysts.

""We needed meaningful capital and we needed to pursue other opportunities"" said Sgourdos. ""It's not easy to raise US$15 billion in one go and there was an opportunity here. We've got a very full pipeline around our core priorities and we're actually engaged on a number of that could very easily in the next year or so consume all of that cash.""

The joke among traders and investors is that a deal that would normally only happen once in a career has now become a recurring event as Hong Kong's market continues to deepen. Investors will watch for the next sale from April 2024 when Prosus' lock-up on its remaining US$224 billion stake expires.

Trending Writer

The past year has seen a real estate boom despite several areas of the economy still struggling due to the pandemic. CBS News reports that home prices grew 15 percent by the end of 2020 compared to the year prior. According to Realtor.com home prices have risen 14.3 percent since the onset of the pandemic there are 50 percent fewer homes on the market and new listings are 27 percent lower than expected for March 2021.

While the increase in home prices and historically low-interest rates have created a “red-hot” seller’s market according to The Washington Post Realtor.com’s Chief Economist Danielle Halle stressed that the “housing market bounced back so much faster than other sectors of the economy that many have forgotten that housing activity slowed to a crawl during the early days of the pandemic.”

Halle is correct to point out that the boom in the real estate market over the past year has dramatically overshadowed the screeching halt it came to at the start of the pandemic. According to The Washington Post February 2020 saw an 8.5 percent decrease in home sales and once the pandemic struck the US economy the loss of 40 million jobs only made the situation worse.

While the real estate market fell into a slump during the first month of the pandemic like several other areas of the US and global economy a turning point came during the summer when city residents began moving to the suburbs for more space and larger homes according to The Washington Post.

CBS News reports that larger homes at more affordable prices are drawing people away from cities who are working remotely and seek a better space to do their jobs.

Boise Idaho is just one of these places attracting people from Seattle San Francisco and other expensive cities looking for more affordable housing and a change of scenery to do their remote work. Rochester is a popular spot for New Yorkers looking to get out of the city and find a more comfortable remote work spot in the tristate.

CBS News also reports that home prices are being pushed by millennial homebuyers who are drawn to the record low-interest rates of the market.

In a year that has turned the economy upside down the real estate market made perhaps the largest come back out of any other economic sector thanks to suburban migration from big cities to more affordable housing with lower interest rates. Buyers and sellers are eager to see where 2021 will take the market as the pandemic-fueled economic roller coaster carries on.

Here's what you need to know,"The cryptocurrency Dogecoin was created in 2013 but it wasn’t until early 2021 – around the time of the now-infamous Reddit-fueled GameStop and AMC short squeeze sagas – that the coin started to attract more mainstream attention.

Built by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer during the early Bitcoin craze and featuring a ""mascot"" of the then-popular meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog the coin was originally conceived as a meta-joke about monetary value and the internet. The joke didn't last long for its creators: Markus and Palmer both ended their involvement with Dogecoin in 2015. In fact Markus recently wrote on Reddit that he sold his coins for (only) about enough to buy a used Honda Civic.

Despite this enthusiasm is high amongst some in the crypto community who continue to “hodl” (a deliberate misspelling of “hold” that refers to buy-and-hold strategies in the context of cryptocurrencies) the “joke” coin – and perhaps there’s good reason. On Monday April 19 Dogecoin’s market capitalization (equated by multiplying a coin’s current price by its circulating supply) hit $50 billion for the first time with the coin itself hitting an all-time high of $0.45 – made possible by surges of roughly 500 percent from the previous week and roughly 5000 percent since the start of the year.

Although it has since decreased in value as of Thursday April 22 the coin is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at roughly $36 billion. For some perspective: the market cap of the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is currently $280 billion and the market cap of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin is hovering around $1 trillion.

CRYPTO-SAVVY is an occasional series from Inverse that explains the world of cryptocurrency and where it’s going next.

Why Dogecoin’s price keeps going up

Cryptocurrency prices by market Cap CoinMarketCap

Dogecoin’s prices have rallied in 2021 for several reasons. However a major one is a seemingly ever-increasing positive cryptocurrency industry sentiment and in turn increasing prices of the coins themselves. In other words it’s not just Dogecoin it’s the entire crypto market.

Last week in a significant move for the industry crypto trading platform and exchange Coinbase fetched an $85 billion valuation in its stock market debut. And earlier this week Venmo (owned by PayPal) announced its more than 70 million customers can now buy Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin and Bitcoin cash for as little as $1. Institutional (and in turn mainstream) adoption is cited as one major factor propelling the rise of cryptocurrencies. And Venmo's foray into the space puts the company among a growing suite of large institutions that have more recently begun accepting or at least recognizing the value of digital currencies.

Mastercard and Visa are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Tesla has started accepting Bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Even Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Reddit Doge Day and Elon Musk

So will Dogecoin reach $1? To answer the question at hand one could look at the coin using the more traditional factors usually considered when evaluating the strength of a digital currency offering factors like blockchain protocols use case price action circulating supply and strength of the development team. (More on that a bit later). But Dogecoin is unique and being in a category all on its own a more all-encompassing assessment requires one to look at other less-traditional influencing factors.

Aside from positive cryptocurrency industry sentiment several other factors have accelerated Dogecoin's recent gains. These include activity on the Reddit thread r/WallStreetBets among the #DogeArmy the social media hype surrounding #DogeDay (April 20) and tweets from celebrities and brands including Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In February after Musk tweeted “Doge” and “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto” we saw a 50 percent surge in price. Just over a week ago Musk tweeted ""Doge Barking at the moon” which boosted the coin’s price some more.

Then there was April 20 (aka 4/20 National Marijuana/Weed Day) which this year an army of Dogecoin advocates on social media declared as “Doge Day.” The idea was that by using hashtags like #DogeArmy #DogeDay420 and #Doge420 they could help propel the value of the coin upward towards the lofty goal of $1 per coin.

Popular brands followed suit and jumped on the #DogeDay420 bandwagon with Dogecoin-related tweets. We saw Milky Way Snickers Slim Jim and others tweet support for the cryptocurrency with the goal of sending the coin to the moon (crypto-talk for a coin that is soon going to rise significantly in price).

While individually these small plugs from brands may seem like potentially irrelevant promotions they can affect a cryptocurrency's price in a big way. One phenomenon seen over the years is the correlation between how much a coin is talked about whether that be measured by mentions on social media or trends on Google and its price.

Dogecoin vs. Bitcoin

Putting aside this aforementioned focus on the cryptocurrency and its “hype value” let’s look at Dogecoin through a more traditional lens. First the coin does not (as of now) have many real-world applications. But there are some: one advocate and enthusiast is entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban who announced in March that his team the Dallas Mavericks would begin to accept the coin as a form of payment. Other adopters include Latvian airline airBaltic electronics retailer Newegg and luxury resort group the Kessler Collection. But overall usage is currently quite limited.

Some argue that Dogecoin does not stack up when compared to tried and tested digital currencies like Bitcoin. On April 20 Mike Novogratz founder and CEO of crypto-focused investment firm Galaxy Digital went on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” explained how Bitcoin is “a well-thought-out well-distributed store of value that’s lasted for 12 years and is growing in adoption.” Another factor that Novogratz believes will positively impact Bitcoin's price and usage is that “tens of billions of dollars'' of capital expenditures and operating expenses are put into the Bitcoin ecosystem every year. These investments simply aren’t there for Dogecoin.

“There is a crazy excitement [from] very young investors around meme coins and meme ideas. I mean it’s shocking to me that GameStop continues to hold any value” Novogratz said. “Dogecoin is even more bizarre in that respect.”

“Dogecoin is even more bizarre in that respect.”

Novogratz and other proponents of Bitcoin — so-called “Bitcoin Maximalists” who believe that the Bitcoin network will provide everything that investors want in a digital currency in the future — also point to its inherent scarcity as a characteristic supporting its value. Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million coins there being around 18.69 million currently in circulation. This feature has led some in the crypto space to dub Bitcoin as “digital gold.”

On the other hand Dogecoin is inflationary and has no supply limit. So it arguably isn’t in the same league as Bitcoin and is in turn (according to some) not a wise long-term investment. Currently there are more than 129 billion Dogecoins in circulation and each minute 10000 DOGE are added into the network. At this rate explains Reddit user EthereumDream miners add more than 5 billion coins per year. This lack of a supply cap is one more reason why some people are skeptical of the cryptocurrency’s massive rally and worry that people buying it will ultimately lose big.

Will Dogecoin reach $1?

Final answer: “Probably yes”

While I’m not offering financial advice here all things considered the short answer is “probably yes.” Positive growing sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency industry as a whole (in just the past few weeks DOGE BTC and ETH all hit all-time highs) a community of passionate Dogecoin supporters and plugs from “tastemakers” like Elon Musk all could drive the price up higher.

Also considering that the coin has made roughly 5000 percent gains in the past year it’s not ridiculous to assume that the coin could triple in value (or more) in due time. One thing should be said here that over the past few months these incredible price increases have indeed provided opportunities to make money in the short term. In early February enticed by a friend who is an avid Redditor I put $50.00 into the coin on Robinhood when it was at about $0.03 and was able to double my money by selling a week later at $0.07. But that was just an experiment. I would have been okay with losing the $50.00 (I half expected to) which meant I was pleasantly surprised when I made a small profit.

But remember the cryptocurrency industry is still young and volatile and due to Dogecoin having a weak use case and no supply cap while the numbers may be looking good now it could easily go the other way. So while the answer is “probably yes” the coin will reach $1.00 will I be investing again? No. I’ll stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum thank you very much."
MOS,Mosaic Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbm90ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3JpemVkLzIwMjEvMDQvdGhyaXZpbmctb24tdGhlLXByYWlyaWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thriving on the prairie | News Sports Jobs,"HARVEY – When Paul Gunderson arrived in Harvey in January 2018 to direct the local Jobs Development Authority CP Rail had just announced plans to decommission its terminal in the city eliminating dozens of local jobs. Community leaders were worried how the blow might impact the town of just over 1700 population.

Gunderson city leaders and the community went to work and three years later Harvey is thriving having added 31 businesses. Its downtown business district along Lincoln Avenue has particularly benefited from new businesses and rehabilitated buildings.

Gunderson attributed Harvey’s success to its abundance of energy and its capacity to think strategically about the future as well as its wealth of civic volunteering and initiative.

“That’s what’s really in my opinion fundamental to a community that needs to sustain itself and grow” he said.

Ann Adams former mayor and executive director for the Harvey Chamber of Commerce credits Harvey’s success to a variety of factors from Gunderson’s knowledge and assistance to the presence of a Jobs Development Authority and strong banking community. She also places the people of the town high on the list because of their acceptance and encouragement of new businesses.

“They embrace people coming here and I think that’s very important” Adams said. “We get an empty building on Main Street we quick think what would be a great thing to put in here and then we go after it and it gets done.”

She added Harvey has produced its own entrepreneurs which helps account for a downtown that’s basically homegrown.

“A lot of young people are helping to create businesses in our town” she said. “We’re just seeing it more and more that we’re getting the word out here that Harvey is an up and coming place.”

Part of that comes from a strategic plan the city pulled together a few years ago.

“We ultimately focused on about eight different areas but a couple of them really pertained to revitalizing downtown” Gunderson said. “We really embarked on a mission to create entrepreneurial capacity within. By the end of 2018 we had 11 new businesses in town.”

Harvey added 10 new businesses in 2019 and eight businesses in 2020. The only loss was one restaurant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This year now we’ve added two more in the first quarter and there’s more pending depending on how things kind of unfold nationally as well as here” Gunderson said.

Harvey still has three vacant buildings on Lincoln Avenue but one is being seriously eyed by a potential business. Gunderson notes vacant spaces are down from 14 in 2018.

Beans & Boutique

Misti Arnold had recently moved from the family farm into Harvey when an opportunity arose to open the coffee shop she’d always wanted. She bought a Lincoln Avenue building that came up for sale in January 2020 gutting and transforming it largely with the help of local contractors and suppliers. They removed the false ceiling and installed new flooring and shiplap walls.

Marsai’s Bean & Boutique opened May 4 and employs eight people. Two hairstylists also rent space in the building and Arnold’s daughter has a nutrition business there.

Arnold partnered with The Farmer’s Wife Cakes in Rugby to obtain baked goods for the coffee shop and recently started offering soups and salads once a week.

“We have people who come to sit and visit and it’s been fun” Arnold said. “The people have been just so supportive.”

The boutique was added to add more value to the space. It stocks largely women’s clothing but recently started a small men’s casual clothing line and Arnold is considering adding children’s clothing.

Her building isn’t the only one recently renovated either.

Just up the avenue is Northern Family Wellness and Chiropractic which rehabilitated a building moving into the new location last July. The building houses a chiropractor massage therapist and reiki therapist. Next door to the chiropractic center is one of Harvey’s newest businesses in a rehabbed building Mosaic Wellness Center

Mosaic Wellness

Mosaic Wellness Center is one piece of the vision of Jonathan and Nicole Franklin who returned to their hometown to recruit mental health services to the area. Nicole is a mental health therapist and Jonathan sold his part ownership in a financial investments firm to move to Harvey and become principal in Mosaic Properties LLC.

“Our goal together is to bring as many therapists to this area as possible because we’re vastly underserved. It’s a mental health desert here” Jonathan Franklin said.

Mosaic Properties LLC has been among businesses taking advantage of Harvey’s new federal Opportunity Zone designation to rehabilitate a deteriorating downtown property for the wellness center.

Jonathan Franklin said the property had been abandoned for about five years before Mosaic Properties acquired it and there had been no improvements for many years before that. A wooden building on the property was removed with the help of a local JDA grant creating an open area where the Franklins installed a fence and plan to create a mini-park.

A separate building with historical character was restored. The Franklins replaced all the windows and doors making use of natural light as well as insulating and putting in a high-efficiency furnace. They also modernized the decor.

“We want people to feel good when they come in here – that they want to be in here” Jonathan Franklin said. “It’s just eliminating one more barrier for people to overcome to get help.”

Recently opened the Mosaic Wellness Center currently includes space for Nicole Franklin’s therapy services a naturopath and an addiction counselor coming part-time from Devils Lake. The building also has meeting room space.

The upper level of the building was refurbished as a two-bedroom unit for Airbnb rentals or to house traveling therapists needing an overnight stay.

“People will come in and just say thank you” Jonathan Franklin said of the community’s response to the changes. “So that has felt very good. The people appreciate all our hard work appreciate our vision. And then they get it and they’re supportive. So that’s a good payoff already.”

The current building is too small for the Franklins’ vision to bring in 20 therapists – the number they see as needed. But Mosaic Properties also has acquired another larger building in Harvey where space does exist for the dream.

Ever-expanding notion

Rod and Angela Marchand and sons Spencer and Quincy are pursuing another vision in Harvey through Marchand Retail Group. Tom’s Home Furnishings is the company’s showplace on Harvey’s Lincoln Avenue where the flooring furniture and appliance store encompasses about half a block. The store has had a growing trade area helped in part by e-commerce.

“E-commerce is where the future is” Spencer Marchand said. “You still get that same service that we have at Tom’s here but all over the state of North Dakota.”

Additionally Tom’s Home Furnishings is the regional powerhouse in flooring employing certified installation teams that work commercially across North Dakota and into Minnesota. The company has done commercial work for grocery chains the railroads and school districts. Through connections and buying groups the store has been competitive and through its service it offers something extra Spencer Marchand said.

Builders Corps another division of Marchand Retail Group helps North Dakota contractors broker their products and grow their small businesses through a buying group.

A third division Accord Comfort Sleep Systems manufactures its own health-centric mattress brand in Chicago.

“We’ve shipped beds to all 50 states and Puerto Rico. We’ve sold all over the country in the last three years” Spencer Marchand said. Having sold in-store online and through Amazon the company now is working on an international market with contacts in India.

“We have another international company that we’re just forming and we should be taking our products internationally and globally as a brand” Rod Marchand said. “All of that has been basically built upon this kind of ever-expanding notion of our company – and I think our belief and desire to do something that is traditionally a little bit bigger than what you would do in a small community. But the world has shrunk with all the internet and global connections.”

Rod Marchand’s father Tom started in electronics 41 years ago selling televisions and home stereos. The business transitioned to furniture and in 1999 Rod Marchand bought the company. He expanded the business beyond the traditional community boundaries to embrace a trade area that encompasses North Dakota and extends into Minnesota and South Dakota. The company now employs 14 people.

Spencer and Quincy Marchand saw opportunity in Harvey after graduating from Carlson School of Management in Minneapolis. They returned to their hometown to become the family-owned company’s third generation.

Having his sons to handle the day-to-day business frees his time to work on business and relationship building said Rod Marchand who recently authored a top-selling book on entrepreneurship.

“They’ve been paramount on the back end of that helping me build strategize bringing a younger perspective” he said of his sons. “As much as I like to claim I’m in charge it’s really always a collaborative effort.”

“We really enjoy and are proud of our ability as a company – and with all of our employees – to perform and to really strive for that personal and professional excellence” Quincy Marchand said. “People sometimes forget that even though you’re just selling someone carpet or you’re just putting in a floor here or you’re giving someone a couch that if you do it right it’s actually an impactful way of improving someone’s life that day. We really take that to heart – try to do our best to make people appreciate life a little bit more even through just simple acts of kindness and service.”

Spencer Marchand also stressed the importance of local businesses supporting each other.

“You’ve got to show people that these small towns can be bustling communities again and it all starts at the local level and starts with individual people” he said. “As a small business owner in rural North Dakota we’re very big on buying local supporting small business. You’re not going to save and preserve rural communities if you don’t support each other and so it’s all about for us making sure that we do it for not only ourselves but our surrounding community.”

Cooperative approach

The Harvey Chamber of Commerce takes a similar approach in supporting rural businesses. The chamber’s membership grew from 64 to about 150 as its emphasis on member promotion has attracted not only local businesses but businesses from area communities including Minot Bismarck and Devils Lake.

Through the chamber Adams launched Cruise 52 a free promotional site on Facebook for businesses in any community along U.S. Highway 52. Businesses receive signage for their windows to advertise their participation.

Gunderson said Harvey has been helped by a few other developments. The governor’s emphasis on rebuilding downtowns rather than increasing sprawl and the local medical center’s plan for a large expansion of its clinical capacity made a difference. Also the railroad determined it needed to keep some of those jobs it planned on eliminating.

That’s not to say Harvey doesn’t have challenges. Among them has been recruiting natural gas service to be able to attract industry. Other concerns are asset transfer to ensure businesses continue to the next generation and workforce development to fill local jobs.

Going forward Harvey leaders will be working to address those issues Gunderson said.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Motorola Solutions is 2.8% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Hardware industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 1.3% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Hardware industry.

One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months Motorola Solutions's ROIC is 13.52 while its WACC came in at 5.93. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Motorola Solutions is shown below:

An East Coast businessman lures in more than two dozen investors with promises of lucrative profits — when in reality those profits don’t exist and he’s using money from new investors to pay back previous ones.

But in this particular case his name isn’t Bernie Madoff. It’s Ian Bick.

By 2013 Bick was an 18-year-old event promoter with multiple businesses in Danbury Connecticut. On the outside they seemed to be the successful ventures of an entrepreneurial prodigy. But behind the scenes “it was a free-for-all s**tshow” Bick says in “Generation Hustle” HBO Max’s new anthology series about the young ambitious and fraudulent.

While Bick says he wasn’t trying to run a Ponzi scheme – “I looked at it as taking one loan to pay off another loan” Bick explains in the series – the feds disagreed. In 2016 Bick was convicted of defrauding his business investors of nearly $500000.

Whether on the smaller scale like Bick’s or superlatively large like Bernie Madoff’s this kind of financial fraud is unnervingly and increasingly common. Here’s a look at eight of the most notorious Ponzi schemes in US history:

1. Charles Ponzi – $15 million

Compared to today’s notorious cons the loss associated with this scam in 1920 might seem a pittance. But in the tale of Charles Ponzi it wasn’t just the size of the swindle but the speed with which it was done. According to Smithsonian Magazine Ponzi made an estimated $15 million in eight months by convincing lenders he could make them rich with investments in international postal reply coupons. His story was so infamous that the basics of the pyramid scheme – take money from a new investor to pay back an old one – began to carry his name despite the fact that he wasn’t the first to do it.

2. Lou Pearlman – $300 million

The man behind platinum-selling boy bands ‘NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys Lou Pearlman’s legacy also includes a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition to being sued by the very boy bands he created for stealing money Pearlman swindled investors and banks out of more than $300 million on the basis of companies that only existed on paper.

In 2008 he was convicted of conspiracy and money laundering charges and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. He died at the age of 62 in 2016.

3. Gerald Payne and Greater Ministries International – $448 million

In the 1990s Gerald Payne and leadership at his Greater Ministries International Church convinced nearly 20000 investors to hand over millions in a program that claimed it could “Double Your Blessings.” The IRS began to investigate based on suspicious bank activity and by 2001 Payne was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison. At the time the IRS called it one of the biggest Ponzi schemes it had ever investigated.

4. Reed Slatkin – $593 million

Known as a co-founder of EarthLink the internet service provider that launched in the mid-90s prosecutors say Reed Slatkin’s massive Ponzi scheme began long before the company existed. In 2003 the former Santa Barbara investment manager pleaded guilty to defrauding his investors of more than $500 million across 15 years starting in 1986.

5. Scott Rothstein – $1.2 billion

It isn’t always finance types who run the biggest scams: Scott Rothstein used his Fort Lauderdale law firm to run an eye-popping $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. According to the Miami Herald Rothstein convinced his investors to buy into bogus legal settlements. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 – a term that’s held despite his attempts at reduction.

6. Tom Petters – $3.7 billion

Businessman Tom Petters was accused of stealing money from hedge funds missionaries and pastors alike according to the New York Times. Petters promised investors that by pouring money into his organization they’d fund the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit. But that’s not what happened and in 2010 Petters was sentenced to 50 years in prison. The scam is reportedly the biggest in Minnesota history.

7. R. Allen Stanford – $7 billion

Texas tycoon R. Allen Stanford masterminded a 20-year scheme via his offshore bank in Antigua cheating almost 30000 investors from more than 100 countries out of billions. The scam involved fake certificates of deposit and prosecutors accused Stanford of funneling funds into his personal interests including real estate and cricket tournaments. In 2012 Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in federal lockup.

8. Bernie Madoff – $20 billion

It’s unclear at what point Bernie Madoff began shaping the largest Ponzi scheme in history; some believe it may have extended all the way back to the 1960s. Regardless of the timeframe what is known is that he conned thousands of investors out of $20 billion in principal funds. After his arrest in 2008 he was sentenced to 150 years in prison where he died on April 14 at the age of 82.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvb2xtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIvbGF0aGFtLWlwby1iZWdpbnMtdHJhZGluZy1vbi1uYXNkYXEv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9vbG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbnVmYWN0dXJlci9sYXRoYW0taXBvLWJlZ2lucy10cmFkaW5nLW9uLW5hc2RhcS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latham IPO begins trading on Nasdaq,"Pentair (NYSE: PNR) a leader in helping the world sustainably move improve and enjoy water is honored to receive the 2024 ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year – Sustained Excellence Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy.

(CBC)

When St. John's tech startup Clockwork Fox Studios went looking for a partner to help them distribute their math education app in the United States they weren't looking to sell the company.

But that's what happened as the company which makes educational game Zorbit's Math Adventure has now been acquired by Carnegie Learning in Philadelphia.

The sale was finalized April 19 but the company's CEO Ed Martin won't say publicly how much the deal is worth.

Zorbit's Math Adventure is a game that teaches math to children in kindergarten to Grade 3 through play-based learning and includes tools and resources for teachers.

""We were doing really well in Canada and we wanted to accelerate our way to the U.S. and we thought finding a like-minded company who already had a footprint in the U.S. was the best way to do that"" said Martin.

He said the two companies are such a good fit for one another that it persuaded him to sell.

""They had a digital product for [Grade] 6-12 math. We are K-3 building [grades] 4 5 and 6"" Martin said.

""They had a really good footprint in the U.S. and wanted to get into Canada. We were the other way around.""

Martin said their offices on Harvey Road will become Carnegie Learning's Canadian headquarters and their first international office. He said he will become CEO of the company's Canadian office and all 34 employees will remain.

More global attention for N.L. tech industry

The sale of Clockwork Fox Studios comes just a few months after fellow St. John's-based tech firm Verafin was acquired by Nasdaq in a $2.75-billion US deal.

TechNL CEO Paul Preston says it speaks to the talent and support for tech startups in Newfoundland and Labrador.

""It's certainly bringing global attention to what's been going on here for a while"" he said. ""There's something unique taking place in our ecosystem.""

Paul Preston CEO of TechNL says people are realizing that they can start and build technology companies in the province and have great careers. (CBC)

Preston said people are beginning to realize they can start and build companies in the province and he believes more sales and growth are on the horizon as the sector diversifies.

""I frankly think we're going to see 10 to 15 $100-million companies. I would love to see that here"" he said.

""I think we're going to see a lot of our existing companies scale and have the ability to really impact global markets. Some of those will be purchased. Some of those will stay here and operate as independent organizations.""

Preston said there will be about 2000 jobs in the tech sector in the next four years in various occupations from software development data science artificial intelligence and machine learning to business analysis and marketing and sales.

In the meantime Martin said his company is going to continue developing a new game called Mathstoria for children in grades 4 to 6 and translating their products into French.

If you bailed because of Bollinger Bands  ran away from relative strength or took direction from the directional market indicator in 2021 you paid for it.It’s testament to the straight-up trajectory of stocks that virtually all signals that told investors to do anything but buy have done them a disservice this year. In fact when applied to the S&P 500 15 of 22 chart-based indicators tracked by Bloomberg have actually lost money back-testing data show. And all are doing worse than a simple buy-and-hold strategy which is up 11%.Of course few investors employ technical studies in isolation and even when they do they rarely rely on a single charting technique to inform decisions. But if anything the exercise is a reminder of the futility of calling a market top in a year when the journey has basically been a one-way trip.“What we’ve seen this year is a very strong up market that didn’t get many pullbacks” said Larry Williams 78 creator of the Williams %R indicator that’s designed to capture a shift in a security’s momentum. A long-short strategy based on the technique is down 7.8% since the end of December.“All the overbought and oversold indicators mine as well as anybody else’s didn’t get many buy signals but a lot of sells” he said.The temptation to book profits and bail is getting hard to resist after the S&P 500’s best 12-month rally since the 1930s. Increasing the anxiety are a mountain of charts signaling a market that’s stretched to its limits.Earlier this month the index soared 16% above its 200-day average a feat that before December had occurred only a handful times over the past three decades. Moreover the benchmark’s relative strength index has surpassed 70 on both a weekly and monthly basis a sign that the market has risen too far too fast.Add in pundits warning of bubble-like valuations and resurgent coronavirus concerns and it’s a recipe for sell orders. Hedge funds for instance have hit the exits this month stampeding out of tech stocks just days before Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. report financial results.Yet avoiding the stock market for any period of time has proven to be the riskiest wager of all. The S&P 500 has yet to retrench more than 5% this year. At the same time missing out on the big up days is more penalizing than ever. Absent the top five sessions the index’s 11% gain dwindles to 2%.“To try to guess that this is the right time to be out of the market you may as well go to Las Vegas” said Mark Stoeckle chief executive officer at Adams Funds. “There’s just as much risk doing that.”Bloomberg’s back-testing model purchases the S&P 500 when an indicator signals a “buy” and holds it until a “sell” is generated. At that time the index is sold and a short position is established and kept until a buy is triggered.A strategy following RSI signals has dropped 10% this year. The damage occurred as stocks entered the year with unbridled momentum that touched off an order to sell. The trade has since been in place as the S&P 500 never pulled back fast and long enough to flash buy.The moving average convergence/divergence indicator -- better known as MACD -- has suffered a loss of 9.8%. Five of the nine trading signals that the model has produced have been buys and four of them have lost money. In addition all four short recommendations have been losers.Such is the cost of betting against momentum in a market where the S&P 500 has already eclipsed the average Wall Street strategist’s year-end target.“Today and for much of 2020 the overbought conditions have been absorbed by the market with more strength or at best a pause” said Renaissance Macro Research co-founder Jeff deGraaf who ranked as the top technical analyst in Institutional Investor ’s annual survey for 11 straight years through 2015. “Overbought/oversold conditions are useless without first defining the underlying trend of the market.”Williams who has been trading since 1962 agrees. Technical analysis tools aren’t broken he says but in a bull market that’s as resilient as this one investors need to use them in the right context.“You have to have a different tool if you will for a job you’re doing” he said. “I have a hammer that can build a house but if I use the hammer to dig a hole in the ground that’s going to be really hard.”"

Netflix had come into Sunday night with 36 nominations far more than any other studio.

The company’s wins at the 93rd Academy Awards included two Oscars for David Fincher’s “Mank” the most-nominated film this year with 10 nods for cinematography (for Erik Messerschmidt) and production design (for Donald Graham Burt and Jan Pascale).

“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” adapted from the play by August Wilson also picked up two Oscars: for makeup and hairstyling (with Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson the first Black women to win in the category alongside Sergio Lopez-Rivera) and costume design (Ann Roth). Chadwick Boseman was widely considered the favorite to win a posthumous best actor Oscar for his turn in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” but Anthony Hopkins landed the award for “The Father.” Viola Davis was in the running for best actress which went to Frances McDormand for “Nomadland.”

Netflix’s seven Oscars are the most wins for a single studio since 2017 when Lionsgate nabbed eight (including six for “La La Land”).

After Netflix Disney overall had the most wins at this year’s Oscars with five: Its Searchlight Pictures’ “Nomadland” picked up three wins (best picture director for Chloé Zhao and actress for McDormand) and Disney-Pixar got two for “Soul” (best animated feature film and score) representing the first-ever Academy Awards for Disney Plus.

Warner Bros. had three Oscars wins: two for “Judas and the Black Messiah” (supporting actor for Daniel Kaluuya and song for H.E.R.’s “Fight For You”) and one for “Tenet” (visual effects).

Amazon Studios‘ “Sound of Metal” garnered two Oscar wins — for film editing and sound — after Amazon had nabbed 12 total nominations. Sony Pictures Classics also won a pair of Oscars for “The Father” (Hopkins for actor and adapted screenplay).

Among other streamers at the 2021 Oscars Apple had two nominations (for “Wolfwalkers” and “Greyhound”) and Hulu had one (for Andra Day in “The United States vs. Billie Holiday”) but they came away empty-handed.

Netflix in addition to the awards for “Mank” and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” also won Oscars for documentary feature “My Octopus Teacher” from Pippa Ehrlich James Reed and Craig Foster; live-action short for “Two Distant Strangers” from Travon Free and Martin Desmond Roe about a man who gets stuck in a time loop and relives a deadly run-in with a cop; and animated short film “If Anything Happens I Love You” from Will McCormack and Michael Govier which follows parents as they struggle to accept the death of their daughter who was killed in a school shooting.

Overall Netflix had at least one nominee in 22 of the 23 Oscars categories (with the sole exception of international feature film). That included two contenders for best picture: “Mank” and “The Trial of the Chicago 7” the latter of which had six nominations but was shut out from any wins.

In 2020 Netflix had won just two Academy Awards after 24 nominations: Laura Dern for supporting actress for “Marriage Story” and “American Factory” for documentary feature. In 2019 the company won four Oscars: three for Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma” (foreign language film cinematography and director) and one for documentary short for “Period. End of Sentence.”

This year’s Oscars haul for Netflix is a reflection of the global streamer’s concerted effort under film boss Scott Stuber who joined in 2017 to not only boost the volume of its original film slate but also produce awards-contending prestige pics. Netflix’s Oscar wins could serve to bring in some incremental new subscribers. For Stuber and his team perhaps the more important result is further cementing Netflix’s credibility among top-tier Hollywood talent as a major film studio.

If you follow Netflix (NFLX 1.80%) you likely already know the company missed expected subscriber growth projections when it reported its latest earnings. Specifically the streaming giant's net addition of a little less than 4 million paying customers fell short of forecasts for 6.25 million new members. Some see this news as a sign that the pandemic-prompted swell of streaming sign-ups is all but over.

Largely lost in the noise of a membership shortfall however is that Netflix more than doubled its year-over-year profits. The first quarter's bottom line of $1.7 billion is a 140% improvement on net income of $700 million earned during the first quarter of 2020.

So what's the problem? The reason profits grew so dramatically appears to be the same reason subscriber growth was so poor. If this dynamic represents the new normal it's a hint that Netflix may have to choose strong profits or strong customer growth because it can't have both.

Customers don't just show up

For the majority of its existence Netflix has faced no serious competition. Walt Disney (DIS 0.40%) only launched Disney+ in late 2019 and HBO Max from AT&T (T 0.44%) wasn't available until the middle of last year. Disney's Hulu and Fox Corp.'s ad-supported platform Tubi have been around longer but have only become contenders within the past couple of years. And that's just a sampling of new (or newly budding) streaming names.

Netflix hasn't responded in earnest however opting to play more defense against the pandemic than it's played offense against streaming newcomers. Namely marketing spending has dwindled -- a lot -- since early 2020 rather than growing in step with revenue. Last quarter's marketing outlay of $512 million was barely better than the year-ago figure of $504 million and that $504 million was the second-lowest amount Netflix had spent on marketing in any quarter since the final quarter of 2017.

One can't say with certainty the cause-and-effect relationship in play here is an absolute one. The company's subscriber additions are being held up to tough comps after all. In the first quarter of last year Netflix picked up nearly 16 million new subscribers and it added another 10 million in the second quarter of 2020. It's arguable that anyone who wanted to subscribe to Netflix is already on board.

But there's growing evidence that consumers are simply more responsive to other on-demand options despite Netflix's dominance of the market.

Research outfit Kantar delivered the latest salvo in this argument estimating HBO Max picked up more of last quarter's new U.S. streaming business than any other platform: 14.4% of new customers. Prime from Amazon won second place in terms of streaming subscriber additions. ViacomCBS's Paramount+ (formerly known as CBS All-Access) came in third with its 11.8% share last quarter followed by Disney's Disney+ and then its Hulu. Netflix was sixth-best in terms of new U.S. customer growth winning only 8.5% of the nation's new on-demand business.

In a similar vein Ampere Analysis suggests Netflix's share of the U.S. market fell from 29% to 20%.

This doesn't necessarily point to subscriber losses. It does however make it clear that at least some new streaming customers are choosing a rival's platform over Netflix.

Content spending was way down too

It's not just cost-cutting on marketing that may ultimately be undermining Netflix's dominance either. The company spent relatively less on content too during Q1. The first quarter's $3.9 billion cost of revenue (what it spent on content) is only 7% more than the year-ago figure even though revenue grew by an incredible 24%. The graphic below puts things in perspective.

On the surface it may seem irrelevant. The streaming giant still has a huge library of stuff to watch after all.

It's not that simple though. Not only does Netflix need more kinds of content to keep its now-bigger audience entertained it needs more new content to do so. CFO Spence Neumann explained during a post-earnings conference call ""We also have a near-global shutdown in production which we've been ramping safely and at scale through much of last year and into this year but it did push some key title launches into the back -- kind of the back end of -- of this year"" which he conceded ""does create some noise"" in terms of subscriber growth.

To this end the company's already assured investors it's going to ramp content spending back up to $17 billion this year a jump from 2019's budget of $15 billion and on par with 2020's pre-pandemic content budget of $17 billion.

In so doing though last quarter's gross margin of 46% is apt to be whittled back to a historical norm closer to 38%. This will dial back Q1's operating income rate of near 27% of revenue to the company's historical net operating profit margin in the high teens. In terms of dollars these more normalized margin rates would have meant net operating income closer to $1.2 billion last quarter (or less) rather than the $1.7 billion worth of net operating income Netflix actually posted.

The bottom line

It's possible that the first quarter's weak subscriber growth is just the result of bad timing.

Possible but unlikely. Other streaming services are adding more paying members with what appear to be more aggressive ad campaigns and -- in some cases -- more aggressive spending on content. For instance AT&T's WarnerMedia was willing to undermine box office ticket sales of its new $155 million flick Godzilla vs. Kong by offering it at no additional cost via HBO Max. Kantar says it picked up more new streaming subscribers in Q1 as a result.

Rather Netflix may mostly be struggling with subscriber growth simply because it's spending too little on the effort.

If that is indeed the case don't look for last quarter's (or even last year's) profit growth and profit-versus-expense profile to become the new norm. It's the exception to the norm. Netflix has already told us it's going to be spending more on content but don't be surprised if the company again ramps up marketing spending. That's certainly what it should do anyway given how competitive the streaming market has become in just the past year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMS8wNC8yNC96ZXJvLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtYS1uZXctc3VwZXJoZXJvLWNvbWluZy1vZi1hZ2Utc2VyaWVzLWZyb20taXRhbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Zero' On Netflix: A New Superhero Coming-Of-Age Series From Italy,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheenascott/2021/04/24/zero-on-netflix-a-new-superhero-coming-of-age-series-from-italy/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMS8wNC8yNC96ZXJvLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtYS1uZXctc3VwZXJoZXJvLWNvbWluZy1vZi1hZ2Utc2VyaWVzLWZyb20taXRhbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvbmV0ZmxpeC1kd2F5bmUtdGhlLXJvY2stam9obnNvbi1jaHJpcy1oZW1zd29ydGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Pays Dwayne Johnson Chris Hemsworth Millions For New Movies,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpY2hlc3QuY29tL3JpY2gtcG93ZXJmdWwvbmV0ZmxpeC1kd2F5bmUtdGhlLXJvY2stam9obnNvbi1jaHJpcy1oZW1zd29ydGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0eWxpc3QuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90di9uZXRmbGl4LXRoZS1lbXByZXNzLzUxMjI5M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's The Empress is based on this true royal story,Netflix’s The Empress: everything we know about the big new period drama

She explained that the State Housing Company (SHC) had secured 250 acres of land at Duayaw-Nkwanta (100 acres) Tanoso (50 acres) and Yamfo (100 acres) in the Tano North Municipality and contracts would be awarded for work to begin by the close of the year.

The Minister expressed appreciation to the chiefs and people of the towns for releasing lands saying the nationwide affordable housing project would help address the two million housing deficit in the country.

Dr (Mrs) Prempeh also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tano North Constituency said this when she led a delegation from the SHC and paid courtesy calls on the Duayaw-Nkwanta and Yamfo Traditional Councils in the Region on Friday.

The delegation included Mr Roni Nicol the Deputy Managing Director of the SHC Mr Kobina Afoah Imbeah Operations Manager Mr Nii Adjetey Boye Deputy Head of Operations Mr Seth Dzotepe Acting Ashanti Zonal Manager and Mr Emmanuel Kwadwo Kusi Quality Surveyor.

The Chiefs later led the delegation to inspect the lands earmarked for the projects in the two towns.

Dr (Mrs) Prempeh told the Traditional Council members that President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has declared 2021 as the year of infrastructure development adding contracts on many of the affordable housing projects would be awarded for work to begin this year.

This would greatly help the nation address her two million housing deficit and make housing affordable to public and civil servants she added.

On his part Mr Nicol explained that the housing projects would create direct and indirect jobs for the local people saying most of the labour force would be engaged from the local communities.

He said economic activities in the areas would thrive because the SHC would ensure that contractors procure building and construction materials from dealers around the enclaves.

Mr Nicol said construction works on the affordable housing projects had already started and progressing steadily in the Central Upper East Eastern Greater Accra Ashanti Volta and Western North Regions.

He said land litigations had delayed execution of the projects in parts of the country and appealed to the affected traditional authorities to address land litigations for the project to commence in those areas.

Nana Boakye Tromo III the Paramount Chief of Duayaw-Nkwanta Traditional Area said the traditional council released the land for the project last four years and expressed the hope that the project would begin as soon as possible.

He praised government for the affordable housing project and assured that the traditional council would support in facilitating the development of the nation.

Mr Odamtten who was responding to complaints from some assembly members from Tema Newtown on the unavailability of treated water in their communities appealed to the TMA to put in contingency measures to mitigate the challenge.

Some Assembly Members in Tema Newtown during the First Ordinary Meeting of the First Session of the Eighth Assembly of TMA complained to the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) about irregular water supply to their communities.

The Assembly Members who got the opportunity to question GWCL on the issue said the last time the Company served the communities with water was about six to eight months ago.

Based on the issues raised the MP suggested that “the Assembly should consider the installation of big water reservoirs in communities to help those in low lying areas that are not receiving water.”

He noted that not every resident especially those in slums and densely populated areas could afford the services of private water tankers to meet their needs and therefore urged the Assembly to provide them with community tankers.

Mr Odamtten who is a National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP said Tema was facing water scarcity as development in most areas had outgrown the water supply and called for measures to ensure sustainable water provision.

Mr Felix Mensah Nii Anang-La the Tema Metropolitan Chief Executive said the Assembly received complaints from the traditional leaders and the GWCL was informed about the challenge which had forced residents to rely on tankers for water supply.

Responding to the issue Alhaji Alhassan Baba Acting Tema Regional Distribution Manager GWCL attributed the problem to demands higher than the

available water.

He said the pipelines laid in the 1950s were currently insufficient for the increasing population and industries.

Alhaji Baba noted that the three tanks at the Tema Booster Station provided water for a large area including Tema Kpone Ningo-Prampram Ashaiman through to the 37 Military Hospital and parts of the Eastern Region.

The Ordinary Session was attended by Assembly members Heads of Departments Mr Enoch Teye Mensah Greater Accra Representative on the Council of State and Mr Yves Nii Noye Hansen Member of Parliament for Tema Central among others.

Please consider supporting Press Watch by making a donation .

I understand the temptation for the leaders of news organizations to take millions of dollars of free money from Facebook — despite or even because of all the damage the company has done to our industry and the public discourse.

But I don't understand the willingness of the news executives to keep it secret.

My article in the Washington Monthly on Monday revealed how under the cover of launching a news ""tab"" that as far as I can tell doesn't effectively serve any other purpose Facebook in 2019 started delivering massive amounts of cash to the most influential news outlets in America — on the condition that they not reveal the details.

The urgent need for full disclosure of these secret agreements with Facebook is the most obvious takeaway from my research into the multimillion-dollar ""Facebook News"" scheme. The deals were widely hailed at the time as establishing that the social media behemoth would henceforth pay for news. But what they really demonstrated was the continued death grip Facebook has on the news industry and the profound submissiveness of the country's top newsroom executives.

In an effort that Damon Kiesow a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism described to me as being ""flavored with a strong dose of crisis communication and regulation avoidance"" Facebook chose the New York Times the Washington Post the Wall Street Journal ABC News Bloomberg BuzzFeed and other select outlets to be their ""paid partners.""

We don't know how much they get per year because they agreed not to tell. A Facebook spokesperson told me a Wall Street Journal report that outlets were getting up to $3 million a year was ""not too far off"" but that statement was belied by former New York Times CEO Mark Thompson who told me the Times is getting ""far far more.""

Certain other outlets were selected by Facebook to appear in the new section but without getting paid. As we already know news organizations generally pay Facebook to send them traffic not the other way around.

So the money is basically a gift to news outlets that have political clout — and accepting such a gift creates an obvious conflict of interest. The paid ""partners"" are effectively giving the appearance of legitimacy — indeed of benevolence — to a company engaged in choking out the news industry even as it provides oxygen to conspiracy theories and lies. And it leaves the smaller ethnic and local news organizations that really need the help to die.

I fully recognize that a fair and elegant solution to Facebook's profoundly destructive influence on the free press and democracy is not something we can practically expect in the short term. So the best argument in support of the decision to take the money is: What were they supposed to do not take the money?

But that's no excuse for keeping it secret. Facebook's demand for secrecy should have been publicly rejected by outraged news executives.

Going forward news organizations should not only disclose to readers what they're getting and under what circumstances but should also append public disclosures whenever they write about Facebook.

They should publicly acknowledge that taking money from Facebook creates a relationship and they should be up front about what that relationship entails and signifies.

They should provide evidence that neither their news nor opinion sides have been compromised by those deals. I'm not saying anyone in particular has gone easy on Facebook on account of the money but my view (and I recognize I'm a bit of an extremist here) is that the only way to show the absence of any sense of obligation is to bite the hand that feeds you — extra hard.

I wrote the article about Facebook News on a freelance assignment from the Open Markets Institute's Center for Journalism & Liberty as part of the group's work to ensure that a fully independent news media survives the ravages of the Facebook and Google duopoly.

There was a lot of talk about the article at the group's all-day conference on the future of journalism and democracy on Tuesday. Rep. David Cicilline D-R.I. chair of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee cited it as evidence of how Facebook and Google continue to ""have tremendous sway over journalism with their monopoly power over digital advertising and their role as gatekeepers online.""

I discussed the article on a panel that included among others Ben Smith the media columnist for the New York Times who was formerly BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief — and who it turns out negotiated BuzzFeed's deal with Facebook News. (He said that discussion was ""very one-sided"" with Facebook presenting a figure that was ""an estimate that I believe they gave roughly off how much BuzzFeed was being consumed on Facebook which was a lot."")

My article called particular attention to the New York Times' relationship with Facebook in part because the Times' former CEO had been so passionate and eloquent about the danger the company presented to journalism — until he took their money that is.

I asked Smith if he agreed that the Times should at least disclose that it has a deal with Facebook when writing about the company. Smith said he had ""thought about this a lot"" when he was at BuzzFeed. ""I would rather talk about that although my opinion would be the same"" he said ""which is that if we are writing about Facebook … when we were writing about anything vaguely related to Facebook news initiatives we disclose that we were taking their money that we were in a business relationship with them.""

Smith made the point that ""news media companies increasingly have financial relationships all over the map. I guess there is sort of a balance of where should you disclose it.""

But in the case of Facebook News he said ""I don't think it should be hidden or concealed. Certainly when you're writing about anything related to that program you should disclose it. Maybe you should have a page on the site where you disclose all of that stuff actually? It's not crazy for readers to wonder whether it affects journalism.""

Indeed BuzzFeed did disclose (vaguely) that it received compensation from Facebook News in August 2020 in a story about Facebook's handling of inflammatory or misleading posts from Donald Trump and in a February story revealing New York Times columnist David Brooks' previously undisclosed relationship with Facebook.

By contrast there has been no similar disclosure by the New York Times even when explicitly writing about Facebook paying Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for its journalism content in Australia or about news consumption on Facebook and tweaked algorithms for news.

Richard Tofel the president of ProPublica tweeted that he didn't agree with everything in my article but said ""I do think there should be disclosure in news stories about entities with which a news org has a significant commercial link.""

Johnson who is now considering the prospects of a presidential candidacy closed on the six-bedroom 12-bathroom abode on April 6th quietly in an off-market deal.

Considered the largest property in the upscale Beverly Park neighbourhood and home to the likes of Denzel Washington Eddie Murphy Sofía Vergara Sylvester Stallone and Rod Stewart the structure sits on a flat 3.67 acres.

The ultra-private estate is made up of several gates for easy access in and out of the property.

Spanning a massive 1640 sq m the property boasts six bedrooms and 13 bathrooms.

The Mediterranean-style abode comes with every amenity imaginable including a tennis court a sun-drenched pool and spa an indoor pool a large gym a baseball diamond a music room with a recording studio a movie theatre and an elevator.

A separate 233 sq m guesthouse is also included.

Situated high in the mountains above Beverly Hills on a quiet cul-de-sac with no immediate neighbours the long olive tree-lined driveway leads to a motor court.

Johnson 48 recently listed his multimillion-dollar equestrian estate on the outskirts of Atlanta in January but has yet to get any offers.

He was noted as Hollywood’s highest paid actor from films such as the “Fast & Furious” franchise the “Jumanji” franchise and HBO TV series “Ballers.”

Johnson shares two daughters with wife Lauren Hashian who he married in 2019. He has another daughter from a previous marriage.

If he tires of acting perhaps he could consider a shift to a career in politics after a recent poll showed 46% of respondents said that they would consider the movie star for president.

Please consider supporting Press Watch by making a donation .

I understand the temptation for the leaders of news organizations to take millions of dollars of free money from Facebook — despite or even because of all the damage the company has done to our industry and the public discourse.

But I don't understand the willingness of the news executives to keep it secret.

My article in the Washington Monthly on Monday revealed how under the cover of launching a news ""tab"" that as far as I can tell doesn't effectively serve any other purpose Facebook in 2019 started delivering massive amounts of cash to the most influential news outlets in America — on the condition that they not reveal the details.

The urgent need for full disclosure of these secret agreements with Facebook is the most obvious takeaway from my research into the multimillion-dollar ""Facebook News"" scheme. The deals were widely hailed at the time as establishing that the social media behemoth would henceforth pay for news. But what they really demonstrated was the continued death grip Facebook has on the news industry and the profound submissiveness of the country's top newsroom executives.

In an effort that Damon Kiesow a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism described to me as being ""flavored with a strong dose of crisis communication and regulation avoidance"" Facebook chose the New York Times the Washington Post the Wall Street Journal ABC News Bloomberg BuzzFeed and other select outlets to be their ""paid partners.""

We don't know how much they get per year because they agreed not to tell. A Facebook spokesperson told me a Wall Street Journal report that outlets were getting up to $3 million a year was ""not too far off"" but that statement was belied by former New York Times CEO Mark Thompson who told me the Times is getting ""far far more.""

Certain other outlets were selected by Facebook to appear in the new section but without getting paid. As we already know news organizations generally pay Facebook to send them traffic not the other way around.

So the money is basically a gift to news outlets that have political clout — and accepting such a gift creates an obvious conflict of interest. The paid ""partners"" are effectively giving the appearance of legitimacy — indeed of benevolence — to a company engaged in choking out the news industry even as it provides oxygen to conspiracy theories and lies. And it leaves the smaller ethnic and local news organizations that really need the help to die.

I fully recognize that a fair and elegant solution to Facebook's profoundly destructive influence on the free press and democracy is not something we can practically expect in the short term. So the best argument in support of the decision to take the money is: What were they supposed to do not take the money?

But that's no excuse for keeping it secret. Facebook's demand for secrecy should have been publicly rejected by outraged news executives.

Going forward news organizations should not only disclose to readers what they're getting and under what circumstances but should also append public disclosures whenever they write about Facebook.

They should publicly acknowledge that taking money from Facebook creates a relationship and they should be up front about what that relationship entails and signifies.

They should provide evidence that neither their news nor opinion sides have been compromised by those deals. I'm not saying anyone in particular has gone easy on Facebook on account of the money but my view (and I recognize I'm a bit of an extremist here) is that the only way to show the absence of any sense of obligation is to bite the hand that feeds you — extra hard.

I wrote the article about Facebook News on a freelance assignment from the Open Markets Institute's Center for Journalism & Liberty as part of the group's work to ensure that a fully independent news media survives the ravages of the Facebook and Google duopoly.

There was a lot of talk about the article at the group's all-day conference on the future of journalism and democracy on Tuesday. Rep. David Cicilline D-R.I. chair of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee cited it as evidence of how Facebook and Google continue to ""have tremendous sway over journalism with their monopoly power over digital advertising and their role as gatekeepers online.""

I discussed the article on a panel that included among others Ben Smith the media columnist for the New York Times who was formerly BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief — and who it turns out negotiated BuzzFeed's deal with Facebook News. (He said that discussion was ""very one-sided"" with Facebook presenting a figure that was ""an estimate that I believe they gave roughly off how much BuzzFeed was being consumed on Facebook which was a lot."")

My article called particular attention to the New York Times' relationship with Facebook in part because the Times' former CEO had been so passionate and eloquent about the danger the company presented to journalism — until he took their money that is.

I asked Smith if he agreed that the Times should at least disclose that it has a deal with Facebook when writing about the company. Smith said he had ""thought about this a lot"" when he was at BuzzFeed. ""I would rather talk about that although my opinion would be the same"" he said ""which is that if we are writing about Facebook … when we were writing about anything vaguely related to Facebook news initiatives we disclose that we were taking their money that we were in a business relationship with them.""

Smith made the point that ""news media companies increasingly have financial relationships all over the map. I guess there is sort of a balance of where should you disclose it.""

But in the case of Facebook News he said ""I don't think it should be hidden or concealed. Certainly when you're writing about anything related to that program you should disclose it. Maybe you should have a page on the site where you disclose all of that stuff actually? It's not crazy for readers to wonder whether it affects journalism.""

Indeed BuzzFeed did disclose (vaguely) that it received compensation from Facebook News in August 2020 in a story about Facebook's handling of inflammatory or misleading posts from Donald Trump and in a February story revealing New York Times columnist David Brooks' previously undisclosed relationship with Facebook.

By contrast there has been no similar disclosure by the New York Times even when explicitly writing about Facebook paying Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for its journalism content in Australia or about news consumption on Facebook and tweaked algorithms for news.

Richard Tofel the president of ProPublica tweeted that he didn't agree with everything in my article but said ""I do think there should be disclosure in news stories about entities with which a news org has a significant commercial link.""

Johnson who is now considering the prospects of a presidential candidacy closed on the six-bedroom 12-bathroom abode on April 6th quietly in an off-market deal.

Considered the largest property in the upscale Beverly Park neighbourhood and home to the likes of Denzel Washington Eddie Murphy Sofía Vergara Sylvester Stallone and Rod Stewart the structure sits on a flat 3.67 acres.

The ultra-private estate is made up of several gates for easy access in and out of the property.

Spanning a massive 1640 sq m the property boasts six bedrooms and 13 bathrooms.

The Mediterranean-style abode comes with every amenity imaginable including a tennis court a sun-drenched pool and spa an indoor pool a large gym a baseball diamond a music room with a recording studio a movie theatre and an elevator.

A separate 233 sq m guesthouse is also included.

Situated high in the mountains above Beverly Hills on a quiet cul-de-sac with no immediate neighbours the long olive tree-lined driveway leads to a motor court.

Johnson 48 recently listed his multimillion-dollar equestrian estate on the outskirts of Atlanta in January but has yet to get any offers.

He was noted as Hollywood’s highest paid actor from films such as the “Fast & Furious” franchise the “Jumanji” franchise and HBO TV series “Ballers.”

Johnson shares two daughters with wife Lauren Hashian who he married in 2019. He has another daughter from a previous marriage.

If he tires of acting perhaps he could consider a shift to a career in politics after a recent poll showed 46% of respondents said that they would consider the movie star for president.

The Brickyard Solar Project is owned and operated by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources LLC a wind natural gas solar and nuclear energy provider and would include the creation of a 200-megawatt photovoltaic-solar-energy-gathering facility. The project would consist of approximately 386 fenced-in acres (117 covered by solar panels) in Marion Township and approximately 785 fenced-in acres (235 covered by solar panels) in Union Township. It would be near U.S. 421.

The solar panels would capture photovoltaic energy and convert it into direct current electricity which would flow through inverters and be converted into alternating current electricity. Some of the energy would be stored in a battery system for later use. The rest would power homes and businesses.

Northern Indiana Public Service Co. plans to purchase energy created by the project meaning the energy would stay in Indiana Ally Sexton NextEra’s lead developer on the project said. The panels are designed to operate for at least 30 years according to NextEra. The company often replaces aging solar panels with newer more efficient technology to extend their lives but if there is no longer a demand for a project after 30 years the company will often decommission a project according to the company’s website.

“Energy that we use every day it has to be developed somewhere” Sexton said. “Every one of us goes to turn on a light switch at the beginning of the day and we expect the energy to be there. Solar projects like Brickyard are providing that energy and contributing to the electrical load that each and every one of us use and this project is doing it in a way that is not emitting any carbon byproducts. It’s from a clean and renewable source.”

NextEra officials say the estimated $210 million project would supplement other forms of energy.

NextEra officials expect the project to create approximately 200 jobs for the area during construction and generate between $12.5 and $14.5 million in additional tax revenue within Marion Township and between $30.5 and $35.3 million in the Union/Zionsville rural taxing district during the next 30 years. In total they estimate the project will create up to $50 million in additional tax revenue for Boone County during that time.

Some Zionsville residents however say the project would be an eyesore and negatively affect housing prices thus outweighing potential benefits of the project.

Jess Rivercomb a Zionsville resident who lives next to the proposed project site said the prices of homes in the area would significantly decrease if the project is approved and solar panels dot the area.

“That means my kids get to look out their windows at a solar farm instead of beautiful fields” Rivercomb said. “There’s no way you can say my home will go up in value. These homes in Zionsville literally sell in a day to three days when they go on the market. There is no way if say my house is worth (one price) right now that when there is a big solar farm out there I’m going to be able to sell it for (that). I’m taking a hit and that’s not fair. That’s not fair to me and my family.”

NextEra officials say studies show solar projects will likely not negatively affect home values and that some studies show solar projects can potentially have a positive impact on adjoining property values. For example a 2018 property value impact study by CohnReznick which included an examination of four solar projects in Indiana indicated “no consistent negative impact has occurred to adjacent property that could be attributed to proximity to the adjacent solar farm.” The impact study included data from solar projects in Portage Frankton Valparaiso and a suburban area in Indianapolis the largest of which was on a 56-acre parcel of land.

But Rivercomb and Dan Brownlee another Zionsville resident who lives near the project argue no studies have been conducted in an affluent area like Zionsville. They said Zionsville is one of the most affluent places in the state and nearly any other Indiana location’s housing prices will be less expensive and generate less demand meaning a solar project’s effect on them can’t be compared to studies that have not been conducted in similar areas.

“My property value is going to decrease” Brownlee said. “They can’t convince me otherwise. I’ve looked at different studies and those studies are much smaller developments – 50- to 100-acre fields versus (more than 1000) acres. And they are in economically less affluent neighborhoods. So by nature any type of development is going to increase those property values where if you look at across the street from this (project) it’s a much different scenario.”

Next steps

Before it can be approved the Brickyard Solar project must go before multiple local entities. NextEra officials held an information session at the Boone County 4-H Fairgrounds April 15 marking the first formal step.

The first portion of the project that must be approved by the county and would go before the Boone County Area Planning Commission Boone County Commissioner Donnie Lawson said.

“We are looking to go through the permitting hearings which would be through two jurisdictions — Boone County and The Town of Zionsville” Sexton said.

Permitting hearings for the project are scheduled for late May and June Sexton said. If approved construction of the project would begin in late 2021 and finish in 2022. The project would be online by Dec. 2022 officials said.

Boone County Commissioner Donnie Lawson said many aspects of the project need to be considered.

“How does it affect everyone and everyone in the county? Those are the things you have to look at with all of this” Lawson said. “It might be a really great project but what does it do to the land values around it and the houses and all that? I’m looking at bigger things. I’m not saying it’s wrong but I’m not saying it’s right either. You have to look at these kinds of things. What’s the economics of it? What’s it going to do for the county? What’s it going to do for all the residents here – the good the bad and the ugly?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2hhcmRpbmdzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS80LzI0L3dvbWVucy10cmFjay1jbGVyaW1hLWJyZWFrcy1odS00MDAtaHVyZGxlcy1yZWNvcmQtc3phcnp5bnNrYS13aW5zLWF0LXBpdHQtc3RhdGUtdHVuZS11cC5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clerima Breaks HU 400 Hurdles Record Szarzynska Wins at Pitt State Tune-Up,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='hardingsports.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Dubbed “Medium Grey/Cool Grey” this rework is perfect for those who like to keep it plain and simple.

The upper is constructed out of breathable mesh material while the overlays are made from leather and synthetic fabric for extra ventilation. The gray hues form a gradient that transitions from dark to light starting from the bottom while the mini Swoosh on the lateral is dressed in a subtle silver tone. Rounding out the design are the chunky white midsoles and “Medium Grey” outsoles. Take a closer look at the sneaker above.

Priced at $170 USD the Air Max 95 in “Medium Grey/Cool Grey” is now available to cop via the Nike web store.

It looks like Vanessa Bryant and the estate are going to launch their own independent line at some point down the road. They’ve already filed for a number of trademarks on logos and Bryant’s signature.

But before everything is all said and done though we’re getting two more Nike drops.

Vanessa Bryant confirmed that there would be two more drops from Kobe’s signature sneaker line with Nike via her Instagram account on Friday.

As far as what they’ll be we have no idea. One can reasonably expect that the Hall of Fame shoe fans have been waiting on will be one of them and that might come once Bryant is inducted into the Hall of Fame this May.

As far as what the other could potentially be we have no idea. All we know is that they’re coming.

Hopefully fans won’t have too rough of a time trying to get their hands on them.

You never know where those dreams will take you.”

Simone Biles said that on  the night before her new partnership with Athleta was announced Friday. Just months out from the Olympics Biles dropped Nike for Athleta the activewear division of the company that owns the Gap Old Navy and Banana Republic. It’s a big change from Nike’s more hard-charging ethos.

Here’s what Biles told the Wall Street Journal about making a change.



“I felt like it wasn’t just about my achievements it’s what I stood for and how they were going to help me use my voice and also be a voice for females and kids” she said. “I feel like they also support me not just as an athlete but just as an individual outside of the gym and the change that I want to create which is so refreshing.”



In all of her media appearances heading into the Tokyo Olympics Biles has talked about her post-gymnastics life. She has not been afraid to talk about how she wants to make an impact beyond sports. When she heard that the USOPC would allow athletes to protest at Olympic trials she said she immediately started to think about how she wanted to speak up.

“Because as soon as they announced it I thought we could do so much with the Leos and kind of make a statement obviously for good” Biles said at recent Olympic media summit. “It’s been really exciting but it wasn’t easy to find my voice or put it out there.”

Athleta is an athletic clothing company but it’s not as associated with the Olympic movement as Nike which has a sponsorship deal with the USOPC through the 2028 Olympics. Biles has openly criticized both the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for its handling of the Larry Nassar gymnastics abuse case. It’s not surprising she wants to move to sponsors who aren’t so tight with the Olympics.

Though Biles still has to get through the Olympic Trials and the Olympics she does have ideas about what she will do once the Tokyo Games are over. She has put together a tour with her fellow gymnasts and has sponsors who align more with what she cares about.

She dreams big and then dreams bigger."

What Happened: The Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (NYSE: CP) won a petition for its proposed tie-up with Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) to be exempt from the merger rules that the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) had established in 2001 Reuters reports.

The STB on Friday confirmed that the waiver it granted to Kansas City Southern in 2001 is applicable to the proposed combination of the two companies.

The regulator's ruling will help Canadian Pacific to gain approval of its bid for Kansas City Southern.

According to the STB Canadian Pacific and Kansas City would remain the smallest of the large North American railroads based on U.S. operating revenues and result in few overlapping routes.

Why It Matters: In March Canadian Pacific agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion in a cash-and-shares deal to create the first U.S.-Mexico-Canada railroad.

The company had earlier stated that while it will remain the smallest of the six major U.S. Class 1 railroads by revenue the merger will make its network more competitive by expanding its reach for customers.

The two railroads combined network will connect points throughout Canada and Mexico and points in the Midwest Northeast and South Central U.S.

Canadian railroads have run into antitrust issues when trying to expand into the U.S. in the past.

CP dropped a $28.4 billion hostile bid for Norfolk Southern Corp in 2016 and failed to finish a deal to buy CSX Corp in 2014.

Northland's most popular and historically significant hot springs are reopening on Tuesday [April 27] after a year-long $4.3 million refurbishment.

The natural hot pool complex at Ngāwhā Springs just east of Kaikohe closed in March 2020 for a badly needed upgrade.

Facilities such as changing rooms were dilapidated and the pools was vulnerable to floods which blanketed the area in mud about once a year.

The revamped complex retains the pools' natural character but boasts a new building with changing rooms a cafe ticket office shop and rooms for health practitioners. A flood wall aims to protect the pools from future extreme weather events.

The upgrade was funded by the Provincial Growth Fund ($1.79m) Foundation North ($1.8m) Lotteries ($710000) Te Puni Kōkiri and Northland Inc.

Parahirahi Ngāwhā Waiariki Trust is kaitiaki (caretaker) of the springs as well as the former Ginns Ngāwhā Spa across the road.

Chairman Te Tuhi Robust said it was a happy coincidence the trust started refurbishing the complex at the onset of Covid-19 when it would have been forced to close anyway.

""It was the perfect time to reinvest in this sacred taonga"" he said.

''For more than 400 years this ancient source of water direct from Papatūānuku has been a place for healing and rejuvenation. Now post Covid-19 we're back better than ever as a place locals and visitors can come for their health and wellbeing.''

The upgrade may also be well timed to make the most of changes in post-Covid tourism.

NZ Māori Tourism marketing manager Kiri Atkinson-Crean said travellers emerging from the pandemic would be drawn to deeper more authentic experiences operating in balance with the land its people and culture.

Accounts of Ngāwhā Springs date back to 1600 when Ngāpuhi ancestress Kareariki discovered the water's curative powers particularly for giving relief to mothers after childbirth.

Robust said warring iwi and hapū would bathe together after battles to embrace the water's healing properties.

Notable Ngāpuhi warrior Hone Heke Pōkai used the pools following the Battle of Mawhekairangi on the shores of Lake Ōmāpere in 1845.

''Ngāwhā has always been special"" Robust said.

''When visitors come to enjoy the beauty of the Bay of Islands they're only 30km away from these healing thermal springs so steeped in history. It's a short hop over the hill but a big step back in time. Visitors and locals can bathe in the healing waters and let the ancient energy revitalise their senses while the minerals from deep in the earth permeate their body'' he said.

While the Ngāwhā Springs complex was closed the trust opened the former Ginns Ngawhā Spa — temporarily dubbed Ginns The Temp — so Northlanders would still have a place to go for a hot soak.

Ginns was closed in 2015 after power company Top Energy which bought the land for a power station expansion found asbestos in some buildings.

That has since been removed and the Ginns complex was bought in 2019 by the Parahirahi Ngawhā Waiariki Trust as part of the power plant consenting process.

The lead contractor in the Ngāwhā Springs revamp was Kaikohe firm Henwood Builders. Council-owned company Far North Holdings managed the project.

The complex was blessed on Friday to ready it for reopening.

■ Ngāwhā Springs will be open daily except Mondays. Winter opening hours (April 1 to November 31) will be 9am-2pm and 4-9m; summer hours (December 1 to March 31) will be 7-11.30am and 5-9.30pm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vYWlzaGEtc2FyZGF1bmEtZm9yLWJ1cmlhbC10b21tb3Jvdy1idWhhcmktb3RoZXJzLW1vdXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aisha Sardauna for burial tommorow Buhari others mourn,"Engineer Aminu Nuhu who is a nephew of the deceased confirmed the death to Daily Trust Saturday.

A daughter of the late Premier of Northern Nigeria Sir Ahmadu Bello Sardauna of Sokoto Aisha who died Saturday at the age of 76 has been described as the pillar of the Sardauna’s family.

Aisha who was fondly called “Hajiya A’i” died at a private hospital in Dubai after battling with diabetes for years.

Engineer Aminu Nuhu who is a nephew of the deceased confirmed the death to Daily Trust Saturday.

She was the second of the three daughters of the late Sardauna.

One of the relatives of the deceased Isa Maude described her as a pillar of the Sardauna’s family adding that “We really lost a pillar. A great wall has fallen”

He noted that “Hajiya has been a supporting pillar to many people in our family.”

Hajiya Aisha was also described as a philanthropist who worked for the well-being of the people.

“She used to bring children of her relations especially those who are poor or living in the village to her residence and train them.

“She even had an empowerment programme for women and orphans” Maude said.

She was the wife of the chairman of the defunct Northern Nigeria Housing Corporation and one of the members who represented Sokoto Province at the House of Representatives in the 1960s Alhaji Ahmad Danbaba (Marafan Sokoto).

She was survived by five children and a younger sister who is the last daughter of the late Premier and wife of late Umaru Aliyu Shinkafi.

According to a family source Hajiya Aisha would be buried at Hubbaren Shehu on Sunday after a funeral prayer which would take place at Masallacin Bello in Sokoto.

Meanwhile President Muhammadu Buhari has voiced sadness over death of Aisha Ahmadu Bello second daughter of late Premier of defunct Northern Region and Sardauna of Sokot the late Sir Ahmadu Bello.

President Buhari in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman Garba Shehu said “the deceased lived a worthy and humble life and was an embodiment of discipline and fine character.”

According to the President Aishatu who is the mother of Magajin Garin Sokoto Alhaji Hassan Danbaba “was not only prominent on account of her birth into a powerful family but also for her own decent character that endeared her to so many people.”

“At 75 Aisha lived a fulfilled life of modesty discipline and decent character virtues that should be emulated by her surviving children and other women” the President added.

President Buhari extended his condolence to the Sokoto State Government Emirate Council her son the Magajin Garin Sokoto Alhaji Danbaba and in-law Ambassador Shehu Malami Sarki Sudan.

He prayed to Allah to forgive the gentle soul of the deceased and reward her noble deeds with paradise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vaW5zaWRlLWthbm9zLTQtbWFqb3ItbWFya2V0cy13aXRoLXBvb3ItbW9iaWxlLWNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Kano’s 4 major markets with poor mobile connectivity,"Speaking to Daily Trust Mukhtar lamented that poor connectivity is one of the biggest challenges businessmen in the state are facing.

Standing beside his shoe shop at the ever-bustling Sabon Gari Market in Kano under the scorching noon sun Mukhtar Ibrahim has spent more than 15 minutes trying to reach out to one of his customers who arrived in Kano from Adamawa State but could not locate the shop.

Disappointed by his inability to reach the customer due to poor mobile network connectivity in the market Mukhtar later decided to use the internet to alternatively communicate with the customer and probably send some of the samples of shoes he has in his shop but that too proved impossible as it also relies on the same poor network from his service provider.

That is how Mukhtar ended up losing a potential Adamawa customer who could have brought a lot of sales and profit to him just because he couldn’t locate his shop and poor network connectivity won’t allow them to communicate either.

Mukhtar’s experience is what many traders in Sabon Gari Kantin Kwari Singer and Kofar Wambai markets in Northern Nigeria’s commercial city of Kano have been going through for over two years.

The situation is particularly of great concern because virtually all businesses and commercial activities today heavily rely on telecommunication companies for all forms of communication ranging from making and receiving calls social media interactions and bank transactions among others.

Speaking to Daily Trust Mukhtar lamented that poor connectivity is one of the biggest challenges businessmen in the state are facing.

He said “Most times your customer will call you while you are at home informing you that he is coming to buy goods from you. But the moment you enter the market all you will be hearing is ‘Not reachable’ when you try to call back.

“If the customer doesn’t know where your shop is you may likely lose him as when he gets to the market and tries to call chances are he may not get you. He will then be left with no option other than to buy from someone else.

“Secondly because most of our businesses have gone digital; a customer may ask for a sample of your goods and you’ll spend an unnecessarily long time trying to send a simple picture through WhatsApp which is not even sent. Or it may show sent at your end but the other person will not receive it to the extent that some might even think it was your fault.”

‘I trek 1km outside market to send goods samples via WhatsApp’

Mukhtar also said “At times I will have to go outside the market and walk about 500 metres or even a kilometre before I send a file. I have lost many customers as a result of this unreliable connectivity.

“The same applies to sending and receiving money from banks due to the same network issue. Imagine coming to market to buy goods then you transfer the money to a trader and it takes two or three hours or at times until after you return home before he receives the payment alert.

“This is one of the reasons why some of us have stopped accepting bank transfers as not all customers will patiently wait until you receive a credit alert before they collect their goods.

“Some of our customers who are from distant states often ask for a sample of goods then they transfer the money to you and you send the goods to them without them necessarily coming to Kano.

But with this problem no one will send his goods to a customer in a distant state without receiving the money except they know the person well.

“Almost all the telecom operators are the same likewise the banks; only that one can say their experiences with some service providers or some banks is worse when compared with others” he concluded.

POS business one of the worst hit

At Kofar Wambai Yusuf Musa who has a Point of Sale (POS) machine shop said the story is not in any way different as they are one of the worst hit by the problem because their business relies 100 per cent on network.

He lamented that many times customers who want to withdraw money from them to buy goods in the market had to give up due to the poor network issue.

“People who come from other states for instance seriously face issues with transactions.

“It affects our business so much as we often have to give up the transaction. For instance a customer may be debited from your end but for the POS operator it will show ‘Transaction declined’. In such a situation you can’t give that customer the money because he will be refunded by the bank later” he lamented.

Basiru Aliyu who sells fabrics in Kantin Kwari market also said until recently most of them had to stop using one of the networks as a result of how it was threatening their businesses.

“Customers and other people always complained that our numbers were either switched off or not reachable. This poses a serious threat to our businesses. The same applies to bank transactions as most people now prefer to come to the market cashless due to security issues but the network instability has continued to fail us.”

Traders use personal network boxes to boost their connections

Aliyu said as a result of the deterioration of the network problem some traders in Kantin Kwari Market now use personal network boxes and antennas to boost connectivity.

This has however compounded the problem as people who don’t have it are plunged into a more serious crisis.

He said the market’s board recently forced all those that installed the boosters to remove them to help curb the problem. The action he said has so far led to improvement in the network in recent weeks.

“The problem is almost the same in making or receiving calls. In fact many traders in Kantin Kwari Market have avoided a particular network provider and migrated to alternatives due to the way they have been losing regular and loyal customers” Aliyu said.

‘We have complained to telecom operators NCC’

When asked if they have lodged their complaints with some of the telecom service operators the Managing Director of Kantin Kwari Market Alhaji Abba Muhammad Bello said they have complained to all of them and that they had assured on doing something about it.

“We have called the attention of all of them and they promised to do something. In fact one of them has even started making an effort towards that and I can assure you that there has been significant improvement recently.

“We have also complained to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and they are on top of the situation also” the MD said.",,,,,,
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZWFzeXJlYWRlcm5ld3MuY29tL2EtZmFzY2luYXRpb24td2l0aC1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A fascination with flight,"Lots of children are interested in aircraft though most dream of flying them rather than designing them. A boy in Long Island named Michael Ciminera was one of the few who was obsessed with the engineering details even as a teenager and he still sounds surprised that two major aircraft companies took him seriously.

“At 12 I had a fascination with airplanes and I started designing them sketching my ideas and building models. As I got older I sent the designs to both Grumman in New York and to Douglas Aircraft in California. They actually marked them up in red and said ‘This is not right that’s not right you should do this you should do that.’ I didn’t know much didn’t completely understand aerodynamics. But you know you go to the library find the books and just follow your interests.”

Following his interests led to a career in aerospace a move to California and more recently a new calling as an author and as president of the Western Museum of Flight in Torrance. First though he had to do something almost all students wrestle with – working while getting an education. He had various jobs through high school including running a clothing and fabric store. Then at 17 he got his dream job as an apprentice in the manufacturing department at Grumman.

“You came to understand how airplanes were built got to know the technicians or the mechanics as they were called then and how you really put an airplane together. After two years they would allow you to go into engineering and then they got you involved in in my case working in the wind tunnel. The last year was again in aerodynamics where I was doing computational work to support a lot of the main engineers. It gave me a nice understanding of the company and how it worked. They really built you from the ground up so to speak where you understood the job that the mechanic had to do in the shop to put together the thing that you can see.”

Ciminera alternated between that job and an education at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute s premier engineering school on the East Coast where he had earned a scholarship. After graduating in 1959 Ciminera knew right where he wanted to go: back to Grumman but not as an apprentice any longer.

“They hired me into the preliminary design department. I was the youngest person ever hired at that time. Because I had sent my designs into the technical staff at Grumman they knew who I was and they said well let’s give him a chance. So I went in there with a lot of people who were very very experienced designers. I was like a kid in a candy store.”

Ciminera worked in the department that grappled with new concepts defining how to create aircraft that could best fit specifications from the Defense Department and other contractors. Over time he became such a trusted member of the team that he was sent to Washington to brief government officials sometimes to gently correct them as they asked for impossible combinations of speed weight and range. After nine years of these theoretical and political calculations he got an offer to go to a new level.

“The chief of preliminary design came to me and said ‘Why don’t you come and work for me because I’ll show you how to build a real airplane.’ Because I had done all the conceptual tradeoffs on the early design I got involved in the details of creating the F-14 Tomcat the aircraft in the movie Top Gun with Tom Cruise. I started in the team that defined the characteristics of the airplane but then I got involved in the details of how to build it.”

The F-14 went into service in 1974 and was extremely successful. It was Grumman’s last major project before the company was acquired by Northrop Corporation based in Hawthorne. In 1994 Ciminera and his wife made the move from Long Island and bought a house on the Palos Verdes Peninsula lured by both the beautiful environment and a very short commute.

“A Northrop Grumman research facility was right up here in Palos Verdes and there are still a lot of aerospace people both active and retired who live on the peninsula. I became one of the retired ones following 51 years with Grumman and Northrop. After that I lectured and wrote and also got more involved with the Western Museum of Flight at Zamperini Field. This is the legacy museum of the Northrop Grumman company with some of the original airplanes that they designed and built that were very advanced. When I first visited I brought some pictures and memorabilia that I thought they might find interesting. After I retired and wound down some corporate consulting they asked me to give a lecture on the design evolution of the F-14 Tomcat which I did. I found that they needed help so I donated some time and gave them some money and eventually was asked to become an advisor. Around 2008 I got involved with helping them develop a patron base a group of people who are interested in aerospace and would contribute money to the museum.

“Then they asked ‘Would you like to be on the board?’ So I said ‘Okay’ and I became a trustee. And then a few years ago they asked me to become president which I am now.”

Like every museum the Western Museum of Flight has been closed by the pandemic.

“We have several large hangars and we are contemplating taking on more space once things settle down. In the last year we’ve built a whole new display on women in aerospace and we’re anxious to reopen so people can see it. In the interim we’ve been making a series of short videos where we bring in experts from all over. They’re in the museum in front of an aircraft display or space vehicle and they talk about their subject. Most last from five to seven minutes. The last one we finished was on the lunar module one that landed on the moon in 1969. These videos are on our website and anyone can access them.

“The other initiative driven by the pandemic is virtual learning. We contacted a lot of schools and asked teachers what they think children are ready to understand depending on their age group. Then we try to create something that they can interact with. We’re not just standing around as a museum of antiquities but we’re trying to think for the future.”

That link to the future also involves teaching about the South Bay’s past as a major aerospace hub. While most of the small companies that flourished here have merged with larger ones now the foundation of much of this area’s wealth was based on the post-World War II aerospace boom. Though Ciminera didn’t grow up here he is passionate about teaching the grandchildren of aerospace pioneers about that legacy.

“When we were open full time we would welcome children from schools in Los Angeles and in Torrance and give them specially guided tours. We help them understand the fundamentals and that’s one of the great strengths of the Western Museum of Flight. We have the original drawings of the Spruce Goose which is now up in Washington. It’s about Grumman Northrop Douglas and all those that got involved in aerospace in Southern California. Teaching and reaching children is all a part of our vision.”

While the museum goes far beyond the legacy of the Northrop Grumman company Michael Ciminera’s books delve into the details of that company. His first “The Aircraft Designers A Grumman Historical Perspective” focuses on that company during its independence and is an unusual combination of corporate history engineering history and the biographies of the people who built the company and the aircraft. It catalogs projects that became wildly successful others that were failures and some that never left the mock-up stage.

Interwoven with technical details are stories from the lives of people at the company and more improbably the poems and songs they wrote while working there. These include parodies of “Hello Dolly” and “Gunga Din” that are the kinds of things people working with balky machinery pen to blow off steam. They show the rarely seen camaraderie within groups of people under pressure.

These diversions enliven passages that are on the technical side and filled with the details of engineering problems found wrestled with and solved. Ciminera admits the book is an unusual hybrid.

“I designed the book to do those three things. It’s a history of a company it describes the aircraft to a certain level and then remembers the people. You always have the big name the chief designer but they choose the 20 to 30 people around them and those are the people I wanted to remember.”

Ciminera just finished his second book which chronicles Northrop-Grumman from its founding to the present. Founder Jack Northrop started his first aerospace enterprise in 1929 and ran three companies before the one that endures to the president day. Ciminera’s history of Northrop and his company took six years to research and write and will be published soon.

“It starts with a picture believe it or not of Jack Northrop’s daughter who is now 100 years old. I interviewed her. I start the book with her and tell what she told us about her dad. Like me she grew up with that — all these wonderful people nobody remembers and that’s why I wrote the books.” PEN",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlY29hc3RkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC90aGUtZ3JlYXQtZmxvcmlkYS1haXItc2hvdy1zZXQtZm9yLW1heS0xNS0xNi1hdC1vcmxhbmRvLW1lbGJvdXJuZS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWFpcnBvcnQtbGluZXVwLWluY2x1ZGVzLWJsdWUtYW5nZWxzLWYtMTYtdmlwZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Great Florida Air Show Set for May 15-16 at Orlando Melbourne International Airport; Lineup includes Blue Angels ...,"Home » Home » The Great Florida Air Show Set for May 15-16 at Orlando Melbourne International Airport; Lineup includes Blue Angels F-16 Viper

BREVARD COUNTY • MELBOURNE FLORIDA – The Great Florida Air Show presented by Northrop Grumman announced its 2021 lineup of world-class performers appearing Saturday May 15 and Sunday May 16 at Orlando Melbourne International Airport (MLB).

In their first Melbourne appearance since 2015 the U.S. Navy Blue Angels will headline the Air Show flying the Team’s new aircraft the F-18 Super Hornet.

This year marks the Blue Angels’ 75th anniversary since its inception in 1946 and it is the first time in 35 years that the Team has upgraded its aircraft.

Scheduled premier performers include: United States Special Operations Command Parachute Team; Official U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper Demonstration Team; U.S. National Aerobatic champions Mike Wiskus of Lucas Oil Air Shows nine-time consecutive winner Rob Holland and Mike Goulian (Red Bull Air Races Champion); Larry Labriola piloting the Aero L-39 Albatros; Gregory “Wired” Colyer flying warbird Ace Maker T-33; and Scott “Scooter” Yoak in his World War II-era Quick Silver P-51.

“MLB couldn’t be more excited to once again host the U.S. Navy Blue Angels along with these other great performers” said Greg Donovan A.A.E. executive director of the Orlando Melbourne International Airport.

“We are looking forward to a high-flying fun and safe event for our community.”

“This air show is an exciting opportunity to enjoy the best of aviation while bringing our community together around the technology we at Northrop Grumman are advancing every day. Given the challenges of last year we’re pleased to work with the Air Show Network and MLB to ensure this outdoor event is safe and accessible to the community” said Kirsten Dreggors vice president of engineering and site leader for Northrop Grumman’s Manned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence.

This year’s first-of-its-kind boutique event produced by The Air Show Network will be reduced capacity to ensure a high-quality guest experience and social distancing.

A limited number of general admission tickets are available.

“At the heart of it we want to create a safe space for air show fans while giving them the best guest experience” said Jim Breen president of The Air Show Network. “To ensure that we produce a quality socially distant show we limited the capacity to half of what it would normally be. With the great lineup and a smaller-scaled audience we’re working to make the show a very special event.”

Tables seating four each will be available in the Flight Line Club. Premium Boxes and additional Air Show seating will be sold in sets of two and four.

Locations can be chosen upon purchase online based on availability.

Each seat grouping will be socially distanced in accordance with CDC protocol. Merchandise and food and beverage transactions will be cashless.

A static display will include the new jaw-dropping Generation 6 Florida Tech Jet Dragster featuring two-time IHRA World Champion Jet Dragster driver Elaine Larsen and the Florida Tech Jet Racing Team.

Table and seating tickets are available now at www.greatfloridaairshow.com. Tickets will not be sold on-site during show days. Parking for the event is free and upgraded VIP parking is available for purchase.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Analysts forecast the H-20’s first flight in the early 2020s with production possibly beginning around 2025. If the H-20 is judged to be of credible design the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China’s stealth capabilities and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China.

In October 2018 Chinese media announced that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) would publicly unveil its new H-20 stealth bomber during a parade celebrating the air arm’s seventieth anniversary in 2019.

Prior news of the H-20’s development had been teased using techniques pioneered by viral marketing campaigns for Hollywood movies. For example the Xi’an Aviation Industrial Corporation released a promotional video in May 2018 pointedly imitating Northrop Grumman’s own Superbowl ad for the B-21 stealth bomber portraying a shrouded flying wing bomber in its final seconds. Later the silhouette of a possible new bomber appeared at a PLAAF gala. This comes only two years after PLAAF Gen. Ma Xiaotian formally revealed the Hong-20’s existence.

If the H-20 does have the range and passable stealth characteristics attributed to it it could alter the strategic calculus between the United States and China by exposing U.S. bases and fleets across the Pacific to surprise air attacks.

Only three countries have both the imperative and the resources to develop huge strategic bombers that can strike targets across the globe: the United States Russia and China. Strategic bombers make sense for China because Beijing perceives dominance of the western half of the Pacific Ocean as essential for its security due to its history of maritime invasion and the challenge posed by the United States in particular. The two superpowers are separated by five to six thousand miles of ocean—and the United States has spent the last century developing a network of island territories such as Guam foreign military bases in East Asia and super-carriers with which it can project air and sea power across that span.

Xi’an Aviation the H-20’s manufacturer also builds China’s H-6 strategic jet bombers a knockoff the 1950s-era Soviet Tu-16 Badger which has recently been upgraded with modern avionics aerial refueling capability and cruise missiles in the later H-6K and H-6J models. Beijing could easily have produced a successor in a similar vein basically a giant four-engine airliner-sized cargo plane loaded with fuel and long-range missiles that’s never intended to get close enough for adversaries to shoot back.

Alternately analyst Andreas Rupprecht reported that China considered developing a late-Cold War style supersonic bomber akin to the U.S. B-1 or Russian Tu-160 called the JH-XX. This would have lugged huge bombloads at high speed and low altitude while exhibiting partial stealth characteristics for a marginal improvement in survivability. However such an approach was already considered excessively vulnerable to modern fighters and air defense by the late twentieth century. A Chinese magazine cover sported a concept image of the JH-XX in 2013 but the project appears to have been set aside for now.

Instead in the PLAAF elected to pursue a more ambitious approach: a slower but far stealthier flying wing like the U.S. B-2 and forthcoming B-21 Raider. A particular advantage of large flying wings is they are less susceptible to detection by low-bandwidth radar such as those on the Navy’s E-2 Hawkeye radar planes which are effective at detecting the approach of smaller stealth fighters.

While China’s development of stealth aircraft technology in the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighter was an obvious prerequisite for the H-20 project so apparently was Xi’an’s development of the hulking Y-20 ‘Chubby Girl’ cargo plane which established the company’s capability to build large long-range aircraft using modern computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques—precision technology essential for mass producing the exterior surfaces of stealth aircraft.

According to a study by Rick Joe at The Diplomat Chinese publications began speculating about the H-20 in the early 2010s. Postulated characteristics include four non-afterburning WS-10A Taihang turbofans sunk into the top of the wing surface with S-shaped saw-toothed inlets for stealth. It’s worth noting that the WS-10 has been plagued by major problems but that hasn’t stopped China from manufacturing fighters using WS-10s with predictably troubled results.

The new strategic bomber is expected to have a maximum un-refueled combat radius exceeding 5000 miles and payload between the H-6’s ten tons and the B-2’s twenty-three tons. This is because the H-20 is reportedly designed to strike targets beyond the “second island ring” (which includes U.S. bases in Japan Guam the Philippines etc.) from bases on mainland China. The third island chain extends to Hawaii and coastal Australia.

In a U.S.-China conflict the best method for neutralizing U.S. air power would be to destroy it on the ground (or carrier deck) especially in the opening hours of a war. While ballistic missiles and H-6 bombers can already contribute to this with long-range missiles these are susceptible to detection and interception given adequate forewarning. A stealth bomber could approach much closer to carrier task forces and air bases before releasing its weapons giving defenses too little time to react. An initial strike might in fact focus on air defense radars “opening the breach” for a follow up wave of less stealthy attacks.

The H-20 will also likely be capable of carrying nuclear weapons finally giving China a full triad of nuclear-capable submarines ballistic missiles and bombers. Though the H-6 was China’s original nuclear bomber these are no longer configured for nuclear strike though that could change if air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise or ballistic missile are devised. Beijing is nervous that the United States’ limited ballistic missile defense capabilities might eventually become adequate for countering China’s small ICBM and SLBM arsenal. The addition of a stealth bomber would contribute to China’s nuclear deterrence by adding a new difficult-to-stop vector of nuclear attack that the U.S. defenses aren’t designed to protect against.

Some Chinese publications also argue that the H-20 will do double-duty as a networked reconnaissance and command & control platform similar to U.S. F-35 stealth fighters. This would make sense as China has developed a diverse arsenal of long-range air- ground- and sea-launched missiles but doesn’t necessarily have a robust reconnaissance network to form a kill-chain cueing these missiles to distant targets. Theoretically an H-20 could rove ahead spying the position of opposing sea-based assets using a low-probability-of-intercept AESA radar and fuse that information to a firing platform hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The H-20 could also be used for electronic warfare or to deploy specialized directed energy.

The crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the public—and international audiences. Once revealed analysts will pour over the aircraft’s geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is looking for radar-reflective Achilles’ heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers. However external analysis cannot provide a full assessment because the quality of the radar-absorbent materials applied to surfaces and the finesse of the manufacturing (avoiding seams protruding screws etc.) has a major impact on radar cross-section.

It is worth bearing in mind however that an H-20 seeking to slip through the gauntlet of long-range search radars scattered across the Pacific to launch CJ-10K cruise missiles with a range of over nine hundred miles would not require the same degree of stealth as an F-35 intended to penetrate more densely defended airspace and launch small diameter bombs with a range of 70 miles.

Analysts forecast the H-20’s first flight in the early 2020s with production possibly beginning around 2025. If the H-20 is judged to be of credible design the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China’s stealth capabilities and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China. The publicity which the often-secretive Chinese government is according the H-20 also indicates Beijing’s hope the bomber will serve as a strategic deterrent to foreign adversaries—even before its first flight.

On April 17 SpaceX won a $2.89 billion contract for exclusive rights to provide a Moon lander for NASA to use in its flagship mission of the decade.

The lander is the third crucial component of the Artemis missions — the name given to NASA’s revived lunar explorations which ended half a century ago with the Apollo missions As part of Artemis NASA’s Space Launch System rocket will bring astronauts to the Moon’s orbit tucked safely inside an Orion crew module. The astronauts will then transfer to SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft — still in prototype — in order to make the descent to the surface and after their science is done use it to ascend back to the Orion module and fly home.

Aside from the sheer size of the sum of cash this contract is a really big deal. Originally SpaceX wasn’t supposed to build the lander alone. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin had convened a “National Team'' with a host of aerospace veteran companies including Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and Draper to develop a lander called Blue Moon. Defense contractor Dynetics had also been initially working on a prototype. NASA gave all three companies preliminary contracts to build a design and then planned to accept two bids for the mission itself. But Blue Origin and co. and Dynetics didn’t make the cut.

In the past NASA has chosen multiple companies to work separately on the same project to encourage competition and ensure it has a backup plan. But SpaceX’s proposal was the only one NASA could afford according to documents obtained by The Washington Post. With only so much money to play with NASA has placed their bet on Elon Musk’s company delivering the goods.

What does this mean for Blue Origin?

The fate of Bezos’ Blue Moon lander is now in jeopardy as it was being specifically developed for the Artemis mission. This is not the case for Starship — that craft is an ongoing project for SpaceX and ultimately designed to take humans to Mars whether they be NASA astronauts or not.

“The National Team doesn’t have very much information yet” a Blue Origin spokesperson tells Inverse. “We are looking to learn more about the selection.”

Of the four companies Blue Origin and Draper lose out the most since Lockheed and Northrup are both already working on other elements of the Artemis mission.

Lockheed Martin has already built and delivered the first Orion spacecraft to NASA. The spacecraft called the Orion Artemis 1 will be part of NASA’s first uncrewed Artemis mission scheduled for launch later in 2021. The Orion module will be launched on top of the Space Launch System rockets sent to orbit the Moon and then return to Earth about three weeks later. It’s a dry run for the later Artemis missions that will have a crew aboard.

Northrop Grumman is building critical rockets for the Space Launch System. Two of Northrop’s Flight Support Booster rockets or FSB-1’s will provide more than 75 percent of the thrust for a launch of the SLS according to a company press release. Each rocket is 154 feet in length and can produce 3.6 million pounds of maximum thrust.

Blue Origin faces setbacks elsewhere as well. The first launch of its heavy-lift rocket called New Glenn has been delayed from late 2021 into late 2022. It also lost a five-year contract to transport national security equipment into space for the Department of Defense in August 2020. The DoD instead selected SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance which is a joint rocket venture from Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

Even Amazon another Bezos company isn’t relying on Blue Origin to launch its Project Kuiper internet satellites. Amazon awarded a contract to ULA earlier this week to put the satellites in orbit during nine launches and an undisclosed time frame.

What does this mean for SpaceX?

SpaceX’s ambitions look beyond the Moon towards Mars. The Red Planet is the eventual goal for the Starship spacecraft. NASA’s Artemis mission is a lucrative pit stop and Musk has said the Starship’s journey to Mars could take place as soon as 2024.

Musk has planned the Starship as a Mars-bound spacecraft for years initially calling earlier iterations the “Mars Colonial Transporter” and “Interplanetary Transport System.” It is still in prototype tests.

The Artemis decision cements Musk’s firm as one of NASA’s most trusted vendors. SpaceX has already flown six astronauts to the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program and is set to bring four more astronauts to the space station this week for Crew-2. This makes it the only private company NASA has used to launch astronauts into orbit. Boeing another company NASA has tapped to launch future crews to the ISS is still conducting uncrewed test launches of its Starliner ship

The Starship prototypes have made four high-altitude flight tests similar to the one planned for this week but the outcomes have been mixed. They’ve all flown but all have exploded either in the air or shortly after landing. The second-to-last test known as SN10 actually landed in one piece but exploded eight minutes later.

As Blue Origin faces continual setbacks the future only looks bright for SpaceX. It’s the only private company that has actually brought astronauts to the ISS and if it continues on the current trajectory it might get us back on the Moon too."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says the Green New Deal needs to start right in Queens.

The environmentalist lawmaker led a belated Earth Day celebration with a call to block an Astoria power plant from being retrofitted to burn natural gas that is produced by fracking.

“That fight now is right here at home in our backyard with the Astoria power plant” AOC said. “We’re not going to allow our water to be compromised. We’re not going to allow our air to be compromised.”

Power producer NRG says its retrofit of the 50-year-old natural gas-burning plant near the Triboro Bridge will actually reduce emissions.

“New Yorkers aren’t choosing between modern back-up electricity plants … and renewable energy. New York needs both” said Tom Atkins a spokesman for NRG.

The plant is called a “peaker” facility because it provides needed additional power to the electric grid during peak consumption periods like during scorching summer heat waves when millions of New Yorkers switch on their air conditioners.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hugs a supporter after speaking at an Earth Day celebration in Astoria Queens on Saturday.

But AOC and other officials including Mayor de Blasio insist the plant should be converted to renewable energy or shut down altogether. Ocasio-Cortez says fracking pours invisible methane into the air and should be banned.

“You’ll be breathing (the emissions) in or they’ll be in the environment and we can’t even see it” AOC said.

The firebrand congresswoman was the main attraction at a festive post-Earth Day picnic that drew about 400 people to Astoria Park on a sun-splashed afternoon. Along with speeches environmentalist groups set up information booths and kids enjoyed games and painting.

Speaker after speaker called for renewed effort to combat climate change and pass AOC’s signature Green New Deal plan.

State Sen. Jessica Ramos (D-Queens) a progressive ally of AOC spent 16 years living in Astoria which she said has the worst air quality in the borough.

“Nobody deserves this. No human being none of our pets” Ramos said drawing enthusiastic cheers. “Nobody deserves to be breathing dirty air.”

Ocasio-Cortez lauded what she called the political revolution that has allowed the Green New Deal to get a hearing in Congress over the fierce opposition of conservatives and the powerful fossil fuels industry.

“We’re doing it to create not just a more sustainable way of life but to create a more sustainable society that we can pass along to our kids” she said. “Because that’s ultimately what this climate crisis is all about.”

To scattered chants of “AOC for President” Ocasio-Cortez vowed that an eco-friendly transformation of American society would benefit working people the most by producing millions of well-paying jobs.

AOC said the Green New Deal would also end the discriminatory impact of pollution on poor and urban communities and ease the plight of so-called climate refugees who flee their countries due to climate change-induced poverty and instability.

Republicans scoff at those claims and predict AOC’s plan will kill thousands of jobs in the energy industry and do little to save the planet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But while it’s notable that the jolly green giant of the semiconductor industry has decided to wade into the data center CPU market Intel and AMD probably don’t have anything to worry about at least for now.

Nvidia’s Grace CPU — announced at GTC 2021 and named for Grace Hopper the U.S. computer programming pioneer — took many by surprise. But it’s probably not what you think it is. And the chipmaker’s decision to call this a CPU while technically correct doesn’t help clear things up either.

You might be thinking a CPU is a CPU so clearly Nvidia is picking a fight with team blue and team red. But the answer is actually no.

Grace isn’t like other CPUs and that’s kind of why Nvidia designed it in the first place. But before I explain why Nvidia is making this thing let me explain what makes it different.

Grace Isn’t Your Run-of-the-Mill CPU

Traditionally CPUs from Intel AMD and even newcomers like Marvell and Ampere are designed with a wide array of use cases in mind. These companies make general compute processors that can be deployed in everything from laptops and workstations to 5G base stations and hyperscale data centers.

Grace is a bit more specialized. Scratch that it’s a whole lot more specialized. And to confuse things even more it’s not even the CPU cores that actually make it unique. Grace will use Arm’s Neoverse N2 core design which is just an updated version of what Marvell and Ampere are already using in many of their products.

If you look at Grace’s estimated SPECrate 2017 Integer benchmark scores of 300 it won’t even be that fast. AMD’s 2-year-old EPYC Rome 7742 used in Nvidia’s DGX A100 server platform is actually faster by that measure. So while a score of 300 is honestly respectable by today’s standards I somehow doubt that spec will hold up nearly as well in two years.

I’m actually surprised Nvidia even threw this number out there. As far as I can tell CPU performance while important isn’t really the point of this chip. Arguably the more important feature is how Grace will communicate with other peripherals specifically GPUs.

GPUs typically communicate with CPUs over the PCIe standard. And usually this works out great. PCIe Gen 4.0 and soon PCIe Gen 5.0 are ridiculously fast — and I’d argue 99% of the time complete overkill. That is unless you happen to be training a massive artificial intelligence (AI) model with a trillion or more parameters. In this exotic-sounding scenario even PCIe Gen 5.0 which when commercially available will deliver upwards of 512 Gb/s of bandwidth to a single device can become a bottleneck.

And clearly Nvidia thinks this scenario is going to get a whole lot more common in the coming years. It’s this niche use case that Nvidia created Grace to address. Instead of PCIe Nvidia is directly coupling the CPU cores and critically the system memory to its GPUs over the company’s proprietary NVLink interconnect technology. And it’s really fast: A little back-of-the-napkin math indicates that each NVLink connection will provide 16 Tb/s of throughput per device. Grace will support up to four to-be-announced GPUs connected over NVLink for an aggregate of 64 Tb/s of total throughput.

Because of this Grace doesn’t make much sense unless you’re using it in a system with at least four of Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs and even then only when running AI workloads so large they can’t fit in the GPU’s video memory.

So should Intel or AMD be worried about Grace? Maybe but only in exceedingly large HPC environments where specialized CPUs from companies like Fujitsu aren’t uncommon.

Don’t Hold Your Breath for More Nvidia CPUs

In a press conference last week Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang basically said Nvidia wasn’t interested in competing in the CPU space and argued that Grace was a special case.

“As a philosophy we tend not to do anything unless the world needs us to do it and it doesn’t exist. When you look at the Grace architecture it’s very unique and it doesn’t look like anything else out there and it also solves a problem that didn’t used to exist” Huang said responding to questions concerning the company’s ambitions in the CPU market.

Let’s not forget outside of gaming Nvidia is essentially unchallenged in the data center GPU market. AMD and Intel both have emerging GPUs in the space but they are relatively small players by comparison. Neither company has anything that comes close to Nvidia’s A100 series GPUs. By comparison the CPU market is getting rather crowded these days.

So unless the existing crop of CPU vendors suddenly become deficient in their ability to solve the next great computing problem Huang is essentially saying he’d rather work with these companies than fight them.

Nvidia is already working with Amazon Ampere and Marvell to add support for its GPUs and has long-standing relationships with both Intel and AMD.

And given Nvidia’s pending acquisition of Arm Holdings for $40 billion this makes a certain kind of sense. The chipmaker has already said it plans to license its graphics and networking intellectual property through Arm. I find it far more likely that we’ll see Nvidia graphics and AI capabilities embedded in CPUs from partner companies than a branded general-purpose CPU at least in the data center.

The consumer space might be a different story and it will be interesting to see what happens to Nvidia’s Tegra CPUs used in Nintendo’s Switch gaming consoles — yep while Nvidia already makes CPUs low power ones anyway — moving forward.

So at least in my mind until such a time comes that Nvidia feels that the CPU vendors have failed to keep up with customer demand and it can do better I don’t see them going toe to toe with AMD’s EPYC or Intel’s Xeon platforms.

DLSS is a proprietary feature of NVIDIA GPUs that provides a host of benefits when gaming most importantly for your framerate. However players have also discovered several ways to customize their NVIDIA settings outside of DLSS and gain an even more competitive advantage.

YouTube / JGOD Many content creators and pro players are now utilizing NVIDIA filters to boost their visuals in Warzone.

How to access NVIDIA filters in Warzone

Before accessing the filters you’ll need to make sure NVIDIA’s GeForce Experience program and the latest graphics drivers are installed on your PC. You can then launch Warzone and open the NVIDIA in-game overlay by pressing the default hotkeys Alt + Z.

Once the overlay is visible select the Game Filter option at the bottom of the left-hand panel. This will open up a separate menu on your screen where you can create three different “styles” (profiles) and customize each to your liking via an extensive list of options.

You’ll be able to customize all of the overlay’s options differently within each of the three profiles. This means you can create three separate options — such as a general baseline profile one for Verdansk and one for Rebirth Island — and easily switch between them as needed.

Best NVIDIA filter settings for Warzone

How you customize your settings will largely depend on personal preference. However there are some general changes that can be extremely helpful like increasing the game’s brightness to improve visibility and make sure you can spot enemies more easily in the dark parts of each map.

He also reveals that tweaking more specific settings like Sharpen Clarify HDR Toning and Bloom — many of which sound like filters you might find on Instagram instead of your gaming PC — can alter your visual experience remarkably.

While utilizing these extra settings isn’t necessarily required to enjoy your time in Warzone if you have an NVIDIA graphics card and aren’t using these options to their fullest you’ll be at a severe disadvantage when facing off against players who’ve mastered these graphical tricks.

As a result global semiconductor manufacturers are facing one of the worst chip shortages in the history of chip manufacturing. Now as per recent reports major chip-makers such as TSMC Nvidia and Intel have said that the ongoing chip shortage will continue till 2022 and might even extend to 2023.

The Chip Shortage

Now if you are unaware of what I am talking about let me give you a quick brief. As more and more things have started becoming what we call “smart” the demand for system-on-chips has been exceeding the supplies from manufacturers. Due to this many of the companies are not able to purchase as many silicon chips as they need because of low supply. It is affecting the smartphone industry too as Samsung following earlier reports has already announced that it will not launch the Galaxy Note series this year.

Excess Demand Less Supply

So as per reports in a recent call with industry analysts the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) which is the world’s largest chip manufacturing company stated that the severity of the current chip shortage will likely reduce in the coming days. However the overall shortage of silicon chipsets will continue this year and may even extend to the next.

The company reportedly said that it is operating at “over 100 percent utilization” to meet the current chipset demands. Moreover citing the current situation TSMC also stated that it will invest around $30 billion for expansion as its gross margin dropped to 49.5 percent as compared to 51.5 percent which the company expected to achieve this year. In addition the Taiwanese chip giant also stated that it expects revenue to grow 20 percent over last year.

Situation to Become Stable in Two Years?

Nvidia which is one of the clients of TSMC also commented on the situation by stating the “overall demand remains very strong and continues to exceed supply while our channel inventories remain quite lean”. Furthermore the company added that it expects this disbalance between the demand and supply of SoCs to continue throughout this year.

The Nvidia CEO Colette Kress reportedly said that Nvidia is hoping to get “sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond Q1 [2022]”. However it will not be able to catch up with the increasing demand.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also spoke about the topic with The Washinton Post and gave similar responses. As per Gelsinger “it just takes a couple of years to build capacity” and due to this creating enough supply takes a bit of time. So speaking about the chip shortage Gelsinger said “I think this is a couple of years until you are totally able to address it.”

So we can expect the current chip shortage to continue for at least another year before coming to a stable state. As a result we can expect more companies to streamline their smartphone lines and other SoC-based product lines in 2022 and 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS1taW5lci0zMi1udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC1ncHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Ethereum ASIC Mines Like 32 GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs,"Chinese mining firm Bitmain has released a teaser of the company's upcoming Antminer E9 Ethereum miner. The company stated that the Antminer E9 would launch very soon although it didn't commit to a specific date.

The Antminer E9 could be the answer to gamers' prayers. If cryptocurrency miners jump on this new ASIC miner they could forgo buying Nvidia's Ampere offerings and maybe just maybe gamers will finally be able to pick up a gaming graphics card. The shelves won't magically fill themselves since cryptocurrency miners aren't the sole cause of the graphics card shortage; we can also blame the pandemic for that as well. Perhaps we could see more stock on the market though.

The Antminer E9 reportedly delivers an Ethereum hash rate up to 3 GH/s equivalent to 32 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 (Ampere) graphics cards mining in unison. If Bitmain delivers on its promise the Antminer E9 will be the fastest ASIC miner available and even outperform Linzhi's Phoenix Ethash ASIC miner that delivers up to 2600 MH/s.

Bitmain didn't reveal too many details about the Antminer E9 except that it draws up to 2556W and flaunts a power efficiency of 0.85 J/M. Therefore the Antminer E9 isn't just faster than the Phoenix miner but also more energy-efficient. For comparison the Phoenix miner pulls 3000W meaning the Antminer E9 has 14.8% lower power consumption.

Obviously an ASIC miner of the caliber of 32 GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards will not come cheap. The current speculation on Twitter is that the Antminer E9 could sell for over $20000 easily. Linzhi's Phoenix miner sells for between $11300 and $13700. Even at $30000 the Antminer E9 could be a very attractive option for mining farms since GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards start at $2500 nowadays and purchasing 32 of them comes down to a whopping $80000.

On the other hand Nvidia probably won't be too pleased with the news of the Antminer E9 since the chipmaker's Ampere graphics cards are selling like hotcakes. Let's not forget that between $100 to $300 million of Nvidia's Q4 revenue originated from cryptomining sales alone.

On top of that Nvidia recently rolled out its Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) products that focus on Ethereum mining. A little over a week ago Nvidia updated its Q1 forecast for CMP sales to peak at $150 million three times higher than its original estimate.

The Antminer E9 won't put a dent in Nvidia's cryptomining business unless Bitmain can produce the Ethereum miner on a large scale. It will certainly be a challenge given the global electronic component shortage that's hitting every industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjEvYXByLzI0L2RpZ2l0YWwtd29ybGQtYmVhdGVyLWFybS1uZWVkcy1hLWhlbHBpbmctaGFuZC1mcm9tLWJvcmlzLWpvaG5zb27SAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIxL2Fwci8yNC9kaWdpdGFsLXdvcmxkLWJlYXRlci1hcm0tbmVlZHMtYS1oZWxwaW5nLWhhbmQtZnJvbS1ib3Jpcy1qb2huc29u?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital world-beater Arm needs a helping hand from Boris Johnson,"Last September Nvidia the American manufacturer of graphics processing chips and the Japanese company SoftBank announced an agreement under which Nvidia would acquire the British chip designer Arm from SoftBank for $40bn. Since SoftBank had acquired Arm in 2016 for $32bn you could say that a 25% profit on a five-year investment isn’t to be sneezed at especially if industry mutterings about SoftBank’s crackpot investment strategy and Arm’s internal difficulties with its China-based operation are to be believed.

But even if one were foolish enough to sympathise with SoftBank’s desire to climb out of the hole it had dug for itself the idea that Arm should be sold to a US chip manufacturer is so daft that even Boris Johnson’s administration had begun to smell a rat. And so on Monday it announced that the secretary of state for digital culture media and sport was “intervening in the sale on national security grounds” based on advice received “from officials across the investment security community”. To which decision the only possible response is: what took him so long?

To fully appreciate the idiocy of allowing the Nvidia deal to go ahead some technical background might be helpful. Arm is a remarkable Cambridge-based company that emerged from the UK’s early lead in microcomputers in the 1980s triggered by the BBC’s digital literacy project and the emergence of the BBC Micro. This famous machine was designed by Acorn a Cambridge startup and it provided the platform on which a generation of programmers and game designers first learned the basics of their craft.

After the success of the BBC machine the question for Acorn’s founders was: what next? Their answer was to design a new kind of processor called a Risc (reduced instruction set computer) machine that had the potential for faster cheaper and more energy-efficient computing. The company they set up to develop this idea was originally called Acorn Risc Machines hence the acronym Arm though it eventually became Advanced Risc Machines.

Arm was based on a clever idea from the outset but the real stroke of genius was its co-founders’ invention of a novel business model. The company would not manufacture chips but merely design processors to exploit Risc architecture and license the designs to anyone who wanted to actually manufacture the chips while paying royalties to Arm for the use of its intellectual property. This was astute because chip manufacturing is a hugely capital-intensive business feasible only for big companies with very deep pockets and an appetite for risk.

The key to Arm’s extraordinary growth was the smartphone revolution kicked off by the Apple iPhone in 2007. Suddenly the world shifted to everyone wanting a powerful handhold computer that could access the internet. And all those little computers needed processors that were small powerful and – most importantly – consumed as little power as possible. In other words Arm designs. The result: something like 95% of all the mobile devices in the world now run on Arm-designed processors. That’s a British success story on an unimaginable scale.

Letting the country’s one genuinely world-beating company go to a US firm would be certifiable lunacy

But here’s the critical bit: Arm doesn’t make chips – that business is left to what are called “silicon foundries” ie semiconductor fabrication plants. If you need a processor for your new phone or tablet or other gizmo and you’re willing to pay the royalty you can use an Arm design. And so can your competitors. Arm can – and does – license its designs to all-comers because it’s not involved in their business! It doesn’t compete with its customers.

Nvidia however does make processors. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the wonders of the silicon world. Originally dominant in the areas of computer gaming graphics processing and film animation it turned out that they are also terrific for building machine-learning systems and neural networks – all stuff that happens on desktop computers or in large racks of servers in datacentres. And as the feeding frenzy over machine learning has become frenetic Nvidia is booming because it’s surfing a tsunami.

But it doesn’t really have a serious foothold in the mobile computing world which is why it was hooked when SoftBank decided to dispose of Arm. In the crazed world of corporate mergers and acquisition it probably looks like a smart purchase. But in the long run it’s a way of crippling Arm (or perhaps even destroying it) because all chip manufacturers are ultimately competitors of Nvidia. They’re in the same business and in that racket only the paranoid survive.

If the Johnson administration is really serious about the UK continuing to have some real clout in the global digital economy then letting the country’s one genuinely world-beating company go to a US firm (which is subject to US government rules about technology exports to China) would be certifiable lunacy. And the annoying thing is that an obvious solution exists: the government should take a 51% stake in Arm to protect it from corporate raiders and let it get on with what it does best.

Brooke Pilkington and Alexandra Viktorovich finished their doubles match first winning 6-4. No. 76 Tatsiana Sasnouskaya and Holly Hutchinson secured the doubles point for Old Dominion after claiming a 7-6 victory.



No. 52 Yulia Starodubtseva gave ODU a 2-0 lead after a 6-3 6-3 singles win. No. 64 Sasnouskaya also won her singles match in straight sets 6-0 7-6 (7-4) to expand the Monarchs lead to 3-1. No. 123 Hutchinson outlasted FAU's Martina Kudelova 6-2 7-6 (15-13) to seal the deal on Old Dominion's semifinal victory.



""We knew this was going to be a tough match. I am very proud of our team for gutting it out"" said ODU head coach Dominic Manilla. ""Looking ahead to tomorrow FIU is a really good team and have beaten Rice twice this season. It should be a great match tomorrow and I am really looking forward to it.""



Old Dominion has now appeared in the past two C-USA title matches as ODU lost to Rice 4-2 in 2019. The Monarchs will look to claim their first ever C-USA title against Florida International on Sunday at 11 a.m. The winner of Sunday's match earns the league's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. No. 3 seed/No. 45 nationally ranked FIU defeated No. 2 seed/No. 37 nationally ranked Rice by a 4-2 score earlier today.

Senior captain Jack Hayden from Apex North Carolina scored six goals including the game winner in the third quarter and added three assists to lead the nationally-ranked Hampden-Sydney College lacrosse team to a 19-10 Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) win over Shenandoah Saturday. The Tigers used 12 different scorers in the victory. H-SC improves to 9-1 overall and 6-0 in the ODAC with the Hornets falling to 4-7 overall and 2-5 in the ODAC.

Prior to the start of the game the Tigers honored its 17 seniors with a ceremony. The class of 2021 includes Garrett Patnesky of Raleigh North Carolina Hayden Jared Medwar of Apex North Carolina William Schlager of Washington D.C. Jake Brummett of Glen Rock Pennsylvania Weston Dunkel of Atlanta Charlie Doetzer of Holly Springs North Carolina Jake O’Brien of Scituate Massachusetts Palmer Jones of Chester Canevin Wallace of Annapolis Maryland Donovan Quinn of Mechanicsville Keith Phillips of Raleigh North Carolina Reilly French of Frederick Maryland Tyler Puhlick of Gainesville Jake Diehl of Charlotte North Carolina Michael Thornton of Farmville and Harry D’Agostino of Massillon Ohio. Hampden-Sydney also honored the five seniors from the class of 2020 that returned for commencement earlier in the day: Augy White Will Hughes Nick Arcuri George Marshall and Chris Zoller.

Three seniors got things started for H-SC with the first three goals of the contest. Hayden scored off an assist from Presley Miller of Annapolis Maryland at 11:52. Less than a minute later Jake O’Brien took a pass from Hayden at 11:07 to put the Tigers up 2-0. With 9:53 left in the first quarter Doetzer found the back of the cage unassisted. The Hornets responded with a pair of goals before Doetzer scored his second of the game this time with an assist from Hayden to extend the lead back to two at 4-2. However SU scored as time expired to pull back within one.

The second quarter was all Tigers with the home team outscoring the Hornets 6-1 to lead 10-4 at the half. Junior Sean Duffy of Ambler Pennsylvania scored the first two goals for H-SC at 14:14 and 13:29 with the later off a pass from Doetzer. Junior Bobby Clagett of Brandywine Maryland scored his goal with 11:02 left in the half off an assist from Hayden. It was then Hayden scoring his second of the game with an assist from Medwar at 10:34. The Hornets stopped the scoring run at 9:27 but the Tigers got right back on another stretch with another goal by Hayden off an assist by French. Sophomore Nick Thompson of Midlothian closed out the scoring in the quarter off by himself at 4:05 giving the Tigers a six-goal lead at the break.

Six goals were scored in the third quarter five of them by the Tigers. Hayden opened with his fourth of the game at 10:26 when French passed it in front of the cage. The Hornets scored their lone goal of the period next before Patnesky scored with 6:36 left in the quarter off a pass from Clagett. Just six second later Brummett took and won the ensuing face off and fired a shot past the Shenandoah freshman goalie to put the Tigers up by eight. Hayden then closed out his scoring and the game’s third quarter with a pair of goals at 5:14 and 2:41.

Dunkel got things started for the Tigers in the fourth quarter when he used his long stick and found the back of the net at 12:29. Freshman Michael Leone of Vienna was next to score for the Tigers as he was pushed from behind but fired a goal as he went down and slid on his stomach to give the Tigers the 17-8 lead with 8:22 left in the game. Junior Andrew Shanley of Leesburg (3:59 assist by sophomore Kevin Marshall of Mt. Pleasant South Carolina) and Jones (2:12) finished up the points on the scoreboard with the Tigers winning 19-10.

Brummett finished the game going 24-27 from the X picking up a game-high 24 ground balls. He is now 174-243 on the season including 65-72 the past three games. Wallace led the Tigers with four caused turnovers while also picking up a ground ball. Eight different Tigers had at least two ground balls with 17 scooping up at least one.

As a team H-SC led Shenandoah in shots (66-29) ground balls (52-25) and faceoff wins (25-7).

The Tigers are back in action on Tuesday April 27 when they travel to Guilford in a rescheduled game that was postponed due to health and safety protocols. Originally scheduled to be played at home the game will be in Greensboro North Carolina.

Powell’s so-called Michigan “Kraken” case styled as King v. Whitmer in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) has devolved into a frenzied fight to determine who should pay for the vexatious litigation — and whether further punishments are due. The government defendants nominally led by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a Democrat want Sidney Powell and other plaintiffs’ attorneys to pay with money and with their careers.

“While it has always been clear that no reasonable person after any due diligence would conclude that the claims made in this litigation were ‘truly statements of fact’ the astounding admissions by Sidney Powell leave no room for doubt that she and all of the attorneys on her team should bear the costs of this litigation and should be barred from practicing in any federal or state court” said court papers filed Friday by the City of Detroit. Those papers followed similar arguments from the other government defendants.

The governments springboarded their arguments off of Powell’s defensive posture in a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems that “no reasonable person” would have believed that her election conspiracy theories were indeed “statements of fact.” Dominion’s legally separate but factually connected $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit remains in its early stages but it has already caused serious side effects on the Kraken case.

As Law&Crime previously reported regarding that defamation case:

In her motion to dismiss Powell does not argue that the statements were true. She claims they are not actionable because they are protected statements of political opinion. “Reasonable people understand that the ‘language of the political arena like the language used in labor disputes … is often vituperative abusive and inexact’” her motion to dismiss argues. “It is likewise a ‘well recognized principle that political statements are inherently prone to exaggeration and hyperbole.’”

Government attorneys in the Michigan Kraken elections case were quick to seize on Powell’s defense tactics in the Dominion defamation case. Their argument is that if Powell’s election claims weren’t “statements of fact” then her Kraken lawsuit ergo was legal garbage for which Powell must now pay.

An attorney representing Powell’s side of the case attempted to rubbish the government’s logic on Friday. Here’s her team’s argument which — in essence — is that Powell’s statements in connection with the election were merely opinions that just so happened to be supported by other people’s “exhibits scholarly articles government sources” and the like (some internal quotations and legal citations omitted):

“Defendants’ argument is that a Sydney Powell “all but admits that she and her co-counsel here have engaged in sanctionable conduct before the court.” Defendants’ new argument fails for the reasons set forth in this brief. [ . . . ] In its lawsuit against Ms. Powell Dominion claimed that Ms. Powell made false and defamatory statements about its voting machines and software used in the 2020 general election through a number of tweets and appearances on television and radio and at rallies and press conferences. Ms. Powell moved to dismiss the complaint . . . arguing among other things that she cannot be held liable for defamation because all her statements were based on facts she had presented to courts around the country through sworn affidavits declarations expert reports and documentary evidence. In her brief Ms. Powell was making that point that as a matter of law opinions are not statements of fact. This is a simple concept that is part of well-developed federal jurisprudence. Indeed based on case law Ms. Powell’s statements are not legally considered “fact.” Rather by placing her statements in the broad and specific context of political debate there are legally considered “opinion.”

Later in the document the Kraken legal team suggested that it should be off the hook for sanctions because the original election lawsuit contained underlying supporting documents upon which nothing more than the Kraken team’s opinions and interpretations were drawn:

When the bases for . . . the conclusion are fully disclosed no reasonable reader would consider the [conclusion] anything but the opinion of the author drawn from the circumstances related. Because the reader understands that such supported opinions represent the writer’s interpretation of the facts presented and because the reader is free to draw his or her own conclusions based upon those facts this type of statement is not actionable in defamation. [ . . . ] Plaintiffs submitted hundreds of pages of exhibits scholarly articles government sources Congressional statements and sworn declarations and affidavits from both fact witnesses and experts in support of their claims.

Recall that the cited supporting materials were roundly debunked by federal judges as not strong enough to even let the cases proceed.

The Kraken team’s Friday document also contained thrashing of “the media” (though no citations to any specific reports were made) by Powell’s team over the way the press reported Powell’s response to the Dominion defamation case.

The national media misunderstood [Powell’s defense tactic] and widely panned it as “an admission.” Of course we should expect this from the media. However the State Defendants know better. Rather than accept the statement as a legal arguments – for which it was intended in the context of a legal documents – the State Defendants have now contrived a so-called “admission” from the Dominion brief that says Ms. Powell concedes that her election fraud theories were not believable or that she never investigated the claims she brought in this court.

The Kraken team then accused the government defendants (who are asking for sanctions) of “intentionally mislead[ing]” the court by characterizing Powell’s defamation defense as an “admission” that her core election claims were factually shaky. The team then boldly told the court that the government should be sanctioned for thus failing to distinguish between “opinion” and “fact.”

The State Defendants’ attorneys should know better; and indeed should be sanctioned for filing this frivolous brief based on the intentional misrepresentation of a legal argument. As explained herein the snippets of partial sentences and paragraphs taken out of context by the State Defendants to sow a false narrative and a phony argument do not support their frivolous motion for $11000 in sanctions. These State Defendants have actually engaged in the very same conduct they try to condemn. They pathetically believe that such malicious and unethical conduct will bolster their political careers. This Court should not be misguided by the State Defendants’ continued frenzy of frivolous and repetitive filings even though sadly enough they are brought by the highest officers in the state.

“The Dominion Action involves claims of defamation and deceptive trade practices – claims entirely separate on law and on the facts from the matter before this Court” the Kraken team continued. Further down in the document the team suggests that “lawyers involved in fast-moving litigation concerning matters of transcendent importance who rely on sworn declarations are entitled to no less protection than journalists” covering breaking news.

“In sum there is no admission by Ms. Powell in the Dominion Action that the facts presented to this Court were false or non-believable” the document says. “There is no admission that Ms. Powell failed to investigate the facts before bringing this case.” A recap of why the litigation was in essence allegedly no big deal (for the purpose of sanctions) then ensued:

This action was commenced by a complaint filed on Wednesday evening November 25 2020 Thanksgiving Eve and amended on Sunday November 29 2020. The case was effectively ended by the court’s decision on December 7 2020 which held among other things that plaintiffs lacked standing and hence this Court has no subject matter jurisdiction. There simply is no way under these undisputed facts that counsel multiplied the proceedings “unreasonably and vexatiously.” None of the cases cited by Defendants come within miles of imposing sanctions on the facts we have here.

Elsewhere in the document Powell’s team frames the original Kraken case as a constitutionally protected attempt to “[p]etition the government for grievance” citing the First Amendment. Because the speech is therein protected the Kraken team claims no court can issue sanctions against it.

The document was signed by attorney Stefanie Lambert Junttila.

“They cannot retain they cannot recruit they don’t know how to evaluate talent” said a client of the WPP media agency. “In speaking with their other clients we have learned that we are being labeled as bad clients as justification for people leaving the agency. They don’t know how to present a team structure don’t have training plans for staffers no onboarding don’t know how to motivate their teams and are not even able to bring their teams together as a basic to collaborate and simply work together.”

In speaking with nearly a dozen former GroupM employees that resigned in the past 12 months Profit learned that the concerns – which allegedly could not honestly be shared in exit interviews due to fear of being blacklisted or labeled a troublemaker – were predominantly on the employee experience (EX). These include the frustration with a problematic culture fixated on media that is the best source of commissions the gradual erosion in media strategy experimentation and the absence of empathy across the leadership team among others.

As reported earlier by Profit the high churn of talent is an issue across the $1.75 billion advertising and media industry in Pakistan with GroupM enjoying a relatively impressive track record of employee retention among media agencies. Across Mindshare Mediacom Wavemaker Xaxis and MEC GroupM averages a 44-month employee tenure which is 19% better than the average tenure of an employee of Z2C Limited across Starcom Pakistan Blitz Advertising Starcrest Communication Brainchild Communications Pakistan and PakMediaCom.

Domino effect

The talent churn issue at GroupM was amplified in 2020 due to former GroupM CEO Fouad Hussain joining the Omnicom Media Group as its new CEO coupled with former Maxus managing director Sarwar Khan co-founding IG Square a media buying house specializing in fit for format media solutions that embrace data content and technology. The departure of Khan followed a wave of high-profile resignations from Maxus.

Chief among them were Umais Naveed who left for the Digital Engagement Network and Roshan Ejaz who left to lead marketing at Jomo. The largest blow however came in the form of Tajdar Chaudhry who left to take over marketing at RDX Sports. In addition two Maxus business managers – Farooq Akbar and Ahsan Khan – left to join IG Square within six months of Khan’s departure.

To make matters worse around this time Z2C Limited poached several GroupM employees to join either Starcom or Brainchild Communications. These include Faheem Siddiqui Muhammad Fahad Zunair Sheikh and the eminent Nathan John. Sheikh told Profit that he did not leave for a premium salary offer stating that he did so in order to shift his focus from digital planning to programmatic advertising. A spokesperson from GroupM insisted that these departures have roots in premium salary offers. The only seemingly amicable departures among this wave are Kiran Khan Ali who chose to retire and Hussain Lotia a former PepsiCo business manager at Mindshare who left to pursue a master’s in Ireland.

On the other hand GroupM Pakistan is clearly a career accelerator according to analysis based on 2020 data. Alumni go on to join consumer goods technology automotive and banking organizations across the APAC and MENA regions with nearly two-thirds of alumni going on to join client-side roles.

LinkedIn data shows that alumni of the media investment firm that immigrated to Canada were able to land work within the network or its client base relatively quickly after obtaining permanent residency whereas counterparts working with affiliate media agencies took three to six months to find work after securing permanent residency in Canada.

Symptoms of toxicity

In speaking with several Pakistan-based former employees of GroupM the overall consensus shared with Profit was to replace the entire executive committee. This includes the chief digital officer the chief financial officer the chief investment officer the managing director of Mindshare the general manager of m/Six and the new managing director of Wavemaker.

“The easiest thing to do in the world is to assign blame and this only serves those with a fixed mindset not a growth mindset” said Tajdar Chaudry a former associate digital director at Wavemaker. “That largely sums up what GroupM is and will likely continue struggling with until conscientiously accountably and transparently are addressed. No amount of lip service will make up for action or lack thereof.”

Echoing the off-record testimony of several former GroupM employees Chaudry stated that people leave bad managers not bad jobs adding that the buck always stops at leadership and it would be easy recommending that the executive committee is merely replaced.

“It’s their departments’ people are leaving not the CEOs” he said. “The last one was removed the problems persist. They’re the constant whether we/they like to admit it or not. Saying all that would not be coming from a place of kindness and empathy however which is my purpose as I [voice] this. I want to highlight the critical ingredients lacking in a majority of present [executive committee] members and incidentally the exact ones needed to navigate & lead a modern workplace through approaching existentialists such as mental health wellbeing and mindful leadership.”

Speaking to Profit Chaudry insisted that the behavior of the executive committee – which has led to a toxic working environment – is not likely intentional and is more likely yet another example of the globally witnessed Dunning-Kruger effect.

“At present they are ‘clueless’ – a word that is both accurate and kind” he said. “They practice ego and fear-led managerial styles and operate from a healthy lack of self-awareness expecting the organization to orbit them. It is no surprise then that when these precedents are set and modeled as “leadership” the same trickles down to lack of loyalty and ownership in the overall ‘work experience’ by their human rank and file.”

He told Profit that when he voiced an interest to join the technology team a member of the executive committee in his reporting line told him he was too old – which is ageist – and it was not his job to take initiative. This experience among others left him appalled incensed and understandably confused.

“When viewed from a place of non-judgment however their words were an insight into a person that believes they might be too old to be operating in their present capacity. They carry that limiting belief – of age and performance – through into their judgment words and actions and confirm to everyone but themselves that they live and operate out of that fear-led place.”

Approaching his experience from an empathic standpoint Chaudry said that the mindset postulated above creates a guarded and insulated presence that views any ambitious subordinates as a threat which is then rewarded with a maze of redirections instead of a career path for creating a future leader.

“They lack that so they’re unable to pass it on to someone as their own” he said. “I have a cornucopia of similar examples – by other executive committee members – that confirm the validity of my diagnosis. I am comfortable sharing it because I am not emotionally invested in the outcome. I’m choosing to share for the human beings still working there who have similar – or worse – toxic experiences under the present leadership and maybe looking to make sense of them. The present status quo is not normal. Not for any place existing in 2021 let alone a company-operated outfit that’s part of the world’s largest media holding company.”

He insists that replacing the executive committee is the first step whether that takes shape as the current executive committee pledging to bring forth better versions of themselves or in the shape of new faces entirely. “Being human is a prerequisite not an option” he said. “Rebirth or reckoning? It’s entirely their choice.”

GroupM shares its talent action plan

To understand what GroupM intends to do about the wave of departures Profit reached out to understand what reasons the media investment firm has identified in exit interviews is at the root behind the talent churn and what the company intends to do about it.

“As the best in class in terms of media we have a kind of three-pronged challenge” said Naveed Asghar CEO of GroupM in an interview with Profit. “If there are any brands that want to strengthen their media departments they reach out and poach our talent because (a) they know that they are very ethical and they are dealing with people with impeccable integrity well trained well-groomed staff. The second challenge is our ace competitors offer a premium and get our people on board. The third is the influx of startups and tech companies which invariably look at GroupM as the prime suspect to get the right talent on board.”

To his point there are a number of examples of client-side media managers originating from GroupM notably Shayan Ahmed at RB Umber Jawed at Ismail Industries Limited Momina Gardezi at Xiaomi Technology and many more. The same has happened in mid-2020 with all agencies under Z2C Limited particularly Starcom notably Fareeha Waheed joining Stylo and Amna Tariq joining Nestlé among several others.

“It becomes a challenge and a half to retain good people” said Asghar. “Having said that we are always trying to inculcate the right culture at GroupM which will give more reasons for people to stay loyal and create differences between performers and nonperformers. If we would inculcate a performance-driven culture we would have better traction and better loyalty coming through from our performers. It would be a combination of having the right intrinsic and extrinsic means & motivators to hopefully keep our best talent rewarded and recognized at all times and that’s an effort we are making to keep our people happy.”

He added that the EX was being enriched through rotations job enhancements both on the job and off-site training and an open & candid culture that would encourage anyone to challenge the status quo. He claimed that GroupM has managed to keep its employee attrition rate below 20% which he stated is the market average.

“In the past year we conducted a culture survey to understand the needs of the employees and making things better in terms of creating new policies being more flexible about how they would like to see their organization to be thinking about how Gen Z would want us to be going forward” said Naureen Awais the general manager of human resources at GroupM. “Bringing that shift in the leadership in itself is a big initiative that we have taken in the past year.”

She said that GroupM has ramped up the frequency of town halls and surveys in an attempt to boost employee engagement adding that performers are publicly recognized and rewarded through a new program called Mengage. Her team resumed a program around developing new leaders has ramped up virtual training and has raised the frequency of activities that bring the company together which she says is especially important amid work from home.

“When people are moving from one organization to another I don’t think salary is the only aspect” she said. “What we really need to focus on is what is beyond money within the media that becomes the anchor for a person to stay in the organization. That needs to be more highlighted going forward.”

Cross-industry expertise

In the critically acclaimed 2020 research paper titled “The effectiveness of employee retention through an uplift modeling approach” academics Evy Rombaut and Marie-Anne Guerry of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel found that providing younger employees with public recognition and significant boosts in compensation had a quantifiable impact on retention.

Furthermore the research duo found that young employees have a great need for constructive feedback and recognition for their work. For older or more seasoned employees the study found that flexibility as a family-friendly work practice and regular advanced training has a measurable impact on employee retention. The researchers concluded that with varying stages of an employee’s life – single married parenthood – needs change from extrinsic to intrinsic.

“While remuneration is important in attracting talent its impact on retaining that talent becomes limited over time” said Jinan Budge a principal analyst at Forrester. “This means you need to create an environment that compels your staff to stay by moving beyond financial rewards making work-life flexibility a priority and cultivating a strong team culture.”

Through a LinkedIn post Budge learned that before even thinking about reshaping culture companies must accept the reality that toxicity exists and needs to be dealt with directly. She said that infighting unhappiness and aggression between team members are signs of a toxic culture in practice

“Fix the hero complex as soon as you spot it” she said. “Our interviewees described teams rife with individuals who talk and act as if they are invincible know everything or are misunderstood geniuses. These individuals can be identified as early as the interview process but if you miss it call it out immediately offer ways for them to correct it and be prepared to act if they don’t.”

She added that toxic leaders – such as those in an executive committee – could be identified through qualitative feedback suggesting a lack of organizational support low leadership maturity lack of role clarity poor communication skills and the inability to create team buy-in.

“Make the case for investing in yourself and people management” she said. “You have a central role in motivating and cultivating meaningful work for your team which in turn drives retention. Seek executive coaching for yourself and your team on how to build mental toughness by first understanding your own performance as well as your workplace behaviors motivation and environment.”

Given its recent acquisition of social media agency Likeable Profit spoke with talent retention leaders at the Pakistani-owned technology services firm 10Pearls which has now grown in functional market share with advertising services. With a talent retention strategy that places purpose and people first the company boasts a workforce of over 750 employees as of January 2021 which is nearly double from the same time last year.

“Out of our total workforce 150+ people have been with us for 5+ years whereas 100+ have been with us for 3-5 years” said Syeda Sana Hussain the senior director of human capital at 10Pearls. “The variables we focus on to attract and retain top talent circle around representative recruitment personal growth & professional advancement lifestyle and remuneration benefits and leveraging technology for a better employee experience.”

The company claims to employ human-centric policies a mentorship mindset and programs goals-driven appraisals continuous improvement plans training opportunities an open-door policy and constant growth opportunities for all the employees. “Our global pool now incorporates not only tech and business resources but also a creative/digital media team” said Hussain.

“Whether it’s tech team business/support functions or creative/media team the key is to proactively listen to them understand their work and the nuances of the market they operate in and foster an ecosystem/culture that motivates recognizes and incentivizes them helps them grow take ownership and genuinely be an advocate of your brand!”

With nearly a third of its workforce being female Hussain claims that 20% of the current female staff has been with the company for over five years with a few for as long as eight years. She says this is why 10Pearls is a three-time winner of the “Best in Gender Diversity” Award from P@SHA and that more than 35% of 10Pearls’ new hires from Q1 2021 are women.

“We have numerous benefits and growth opportunities aimed to encourage women to apply which includes an onsite daycare for working parents toddlers learning center (currently not operational due to COVID) flexible timings and WFH option for all gym and wellness programs paid maternity leave numerous women’s events travel and training opportunities and an overall culture that ensures a safe and encouraging environment for women” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ON,ON Semiconductor,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGVzZS1pbmR1c3RyaWVzLWFyZS1oaXQtaGFyZGVzdC1ieS10aGUtZ2xvYmFsLWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2UtMTIyODU0MjUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 169 industries are being hit by the global chip shortage,"The ongoing global chip shortage has roiled the automotive and consumer technology industries for months. But the ripple effects of the crisis which could last into 2022 stretch far beyond automakers idling plants and consumers waiting longer for the latest gaming consoles.

According to an analysis by Goldman Sachs (GS) the semiconductor shortage touches a mind-blowing 169 industries in some way. We’re talking everything from steel product and ready-mix concrete manufacturing to industries that build air conditioning systems and refrigerators to breweries. Even soap manufacturing is impacted by the chip crisis.

The graphic below breaks down the various industries that are dealing with the shortage.

To determine which industries were hit by the shortage Goldman Sachs looked at each industry’s’ need for microchips and related components as a share of their GDP. Industries that spend more than 1% of their GDP on chips the firm says will be impacted by the semiconductor shortfall.

For reference in the automotive sector 4.7% of industry GDP is spent on microchips and related semiconductors on this basis according to Goldman.

The automotive industry has been particularly burned by the chip shortage due to the way its supply chain works. Automakers tend to run incredibly lean on supplies for vehicles to keep costs down. But the coronavirus pandemic upended that entire system.

When the pandemic began automakers figuring consumers would slow down auto purchases cut down on their supplies of semiconductors used in everything from their vehicles’ infotainment systems to high-end driver-assistance technologies.

But consumer interest in vehicle purchases rebounded faster than the automakers had predicted. And by Q4 of 2020 they were outpacing Q4 2019 sales numbers. At the same time factories remained idling due to coronavirus restrictions putting automakers even further behind.

While that was happening people around the world began buying up consumer technology goods to adjust to the pandemic induced work-from-home and remote learning environments. With automakers not purchasing chips semiconductor makers started working on chips for consumer tech products.

Once the automakers realized they needed more chips than they thought the chipmakers were already dedicating time to making chips for consumer tech companies. Now both industries are struggling for support from the limited number of global semiconductor manufacturers that can meet their needs.

Chips aren’t exactly easy to make either with advanced semiconductors taking up to 6 months to produce. According to Goldman Sachs’ Spencer Hill the semiconductor shortfall could wallop U.S. GDP by as much as 1% despite the uptick in consumer spending as lockdown orders continue to ease.

Story continues

“Some computer chips have no available substitute and if output of every product that uses chips were to decline proportionately the drag on 2021 GDP would be around 1%” Hill wrote in a research note.

While that prediction may sound dire Hill says the true impact on GDP will likely be milder with GDP taking a 0.5% as companies that are able to use different available chips make adjustments to their needs.

The chip crisis is still far from over however and as industry leaders and politicians work to ease the strain on manufacturers across the country consumer goods will still cost more as a result with Goldman predicting a 1% to 3% jumping in prices.

In other words if you’re in need of a car or some kind of laptop or other piece of consumer tech now is the time to buy — if you can find them.

We have lately been increasing our activities in the U.S. market and hold an important position with materials and solutions for the semiconductor industry.



Who invented it?



The telephone videogames chewing gum and cola – all these products which we are used to in our daily lives were invented or made market-ready in the land of opportunity. It’s no wonder that the world’s first computer chip the Intel 4004 first went into production there in 1971.



And this trend has continued. In particular companies from Silicon Valley which is known as the “cradle of technology” continuously churn out their technical achievements. Tech companies such as Apple Facebook Google and eBay as well as leading semiconductor manufacturers are based in the United States. Five U.S. companies including industry leader Intel rank among the top ten in the chip industry. Micron Technology Qualcomm Broadcom and Texas Instruments also rank near the top.



As I explained in my blogpost on the semiconductor market in Asia Asia-Pacific may be the world’s largest semiconductor market. However the Americas rank second. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics this region accounted for US$ 95 billion in semiconductor sales in 2020.



Semiconductors are the key to success



The semiconductor sector has been an important pillar of the U.S. industry for many years. Thanks to technologies such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and wireless networks like 5G demand for chips will remain high after seeing a dynamic acceleration during the pandemic. And politicians are also helping to support this industry. For example at the beginning of this year the U.S. government announced its intention to ensure that the United States remains an attractive production location and to make the country less dependent on imports from Asia in particular. Among other things U.S. President Joe Biden intends to pass a law to provide US$ 50 billion for the chip industry in order to in the future prevent the kinds of bottlenecks in chip production that were seen in the automotive industry at the start of the year. The industry association SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) had previously requested more government money for the U.S. semiconductor industry for this reason.



The U.S. government isn’t the sole driver moving the country forward as a semiconductor hub; companies are also getting involved. For example in November 2020 Apple revealed their own new computer chip M1 with which the tech giant will replace the Intel processors that it has been using in its products for more than two decades. The Taiwanese company TSMC intends to invest US$ 12 billion in the construction of a new chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona. Samsung is also considering investing tens of billions of U.S. dollars in the construction of a factory in Texas for the production of three-nanometer chips.



However the United States and the companies based there rely not only on investments but also on the education of highly qualified employees. Education in STEM subjects is therefore strongly promoted at U.S. universities. I would love to see Europe and Germany join the US in strongly promoting curiosity and STEM for our future generations of scientists.

The company’s plain-spoken founder warned in particular of challenges for the company’s planned new $12 billion fabrication plant in Phoenix Arizona which he and other senior executives and American officials had broken ground on less than a year ago.

TSMC’s cutting-edge semiconductors power phones computers and control electronics in cars and wireless networks. TSMC has profited immensely from the current global chip shortage caused in large part by previous US president Donald Trump’s tech war against China.

The campaign has been carried over during the Biden administration which includes hard bans on the export of any chip-making equipment made with US components to Chinese companies.

At a forum hosted by Taiwanese media outlets Chang hailed the workhorse mentality of the Taiwanese working class as well as the island’s deep pool of high-caliber industrious talent devoted to the chip sector.

At the same time Chang pointed to an apparent comparative lack of talent in America’s mostly moribund manufacturing sector.

“The United States stood out for cheap land and electricity when TSMC looked for an overseas site but we had to try hard to scout out competent technicians and workers in Arizona because manufacturing jobs have not been popular among American people for decades” Chang said according to a transcript of his speech viewed by Asia Times.

Chang also warned about sending Taiwanese managers overseas to run plants.

“Computers of different brands can often be hooked together but not people of different culture” he said referring to the preponderance of Taiwanese and Taiwan-trained managers and technicians at TSMC.

“The fact that TSMC’s top-flight executives can deliver top results in Taiwan is no guarantee of similar performance when they are posted overseas.” Only one Westerner sits on the company’s 26-member board.

Taiwan’s state-of-the-art infrastructure helps to rev up TSMC’s operations and time-to-design and time-to-market capacities he said.

Chang said the island’s efficient and well-developed high-speed rail network and cobweb of expressways provided the vital “circuitry” for TSMC’s research and manufacturing between its headquarters in Hsinchu near Taipei and other plants across Taichung and Tainan.

“It was a breeze for us to rotate technicians and staff among the three fabs across the island and when employees change over from one location to another they even do not need to move their homes thanks to Taiwan’s bullet trains and highways and well-rounded transport and logistical support” said Chang.

“It’s unlikely we can replicate all these in Arizona.”

Chang made a foray into the chipmaking business in 1987 in Hsinchu lured by the city’s convenient location as well as government aid.

He said products made in the US would still be saddled with higher costs even after federal and state governments had each chipped in with hefty investments and subsidies to make the Phoenix project possible.

Chang’s candid remarks about TSMC’s new US base delivered to an audience of domestic reporters mark a striking departure from TSMC chairman Mark Liu’s optimism about Arizona’s chip-making potential.

Liu told US partners in a virtual industry summit earlier this month that the project would hold out high hopes of taking over part of the cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities of 5-nanometer chipsets from Hsinchu in about two years to ease the worsening global supply crunch.

Alex Capri a visiting senior fellow and global supply chain specialist with the National University of Singapore’s Business School told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle that TSMC would continue to face “squeezing” from the China-US rivalry but also beckoning from America as the Biden administration doubled down on its home-made semiconductor push.

“TSMC would have to respond even if from a business point of view it’s more expensive and less efficient to run factories overseas” said the scholar adding that Taiwan would still serve as the prime locus for much of TSMC’s core research and production.

After suggesting that the US was unlikely to have the ingredients to recreate Taiwan’s special mix Chang in his talk pivoted to enthuse over the island’s indispensable attributes.

“Chipmaking is among the very few sectors where Taiwan is ruling the roost across the globe and against the backdrop of geopolitics the chips we make take on particular significance in consumer electronics economy and national defense” he said.

“We must not lose our hard-won primacy to contenders like Samsung and other firms in South Korea.”

He devoted much of his speech to beseech the island’s government and stakeholders to help further entrench Taiwan’s lead vowing that TSMC would always “treasure Taiwan.”

TSMC’s lucrative business – 2020 revenues soared 25% to hit a new high of NT$1.33 trillion (US$47.3 billion) – stands in contrast to Beijing’s tech self-sufficiency drive led by its mainland competitor SMIC.

Chang said the current global chipmaking hub race was currently only between Taiwan and South Korea and that despite Beijing’s state subsidies of tens of billions of dollars TSMC’s research and manufacturing capabilities would still be five years ahead of SMIC and its Chinese peers.

He said China should not seek to short-circuit indigenous research efforts since it could take decades before meaningful breakthroughs could be made.

The Shanghai-based SMIC’s 7-nm chip trial production scheme is reportedly progressing at a snail’s pace after it was hit by American sanctions and export controls banning its suppliers from furnishing equipment such as extreme ultraviolet lithography machines made with US ingenuity.

By any competitive measure Chinese tech colossuses from SMIC to Huawei are still playing a prolonged catch-up in the chip contest.

Sebastian Hou a chip specialist with the Hong Kong-based securities broker CLSA noted in his report earlier this year that SMIC would be “nine years and three generations” behind TSMC as the former could only mass-produce 14-nm chips.

Introduction

According to Article 23(2)(a) Regulation No. 1/2003 the Commission may impose fines on undertakings and associations of undertakings where they either intentionally or negligently infringe Article 101 or 102. In its calculation the Commission must take into account both the gravity and the duration of the infringement and may not exceed 10 percent of the revenues of the addressee in the preceding business year. Beyond that the Commission has a wide discretion in the calculation of the fine.

Following its general aim of increasing the transparency and objectivity of its decisions throughout the years the Commission has published a series of guidelines on the method for setting fines most recently on September 1 2006. This article provides an overview of the application of the 2006 Guidelines to antitrust cases until the mid of 2020 focusing in particular on the violation of Article 101 TFEU. The review follows the structure of the guidelines considering the setting of the fine on an element-by-element basis. Each section includes examples of Commission decisions and court cases (where relevant) which help to provide a clear picture of how the fining method applies in practice.

I. The Setting of the Fine

In order to determine the fine to be imposed on an undertaking the 2006 Guidelines provide for a two-step methodology. In the first step the Commission determines the basic amount of the fine which is based on gravity duration and a sum of between 15 and 25 percent of the value of sales (so called “entry fee” or “additional amount”) which is added to the basic amount. Once the basic amount determined the Commission analyzes the application of possible adjustment factors such as aggravating or mitigating circumstances and deterrence. While the first step focuses on the assessment of the infringement as a whole the second rather reflects all possible elements which are specific to each undertaking in order to better adapt the fine on a case-by-case basis. That said the Commission often adapts its fine calculation methodology to take into account specific circumstances of certain cases. This was the case for example in Water management products where the Commission decided not to take into account periods of limited activity of the cartel.2

A. The Basic Amount

As mentioned above the first element determined by the Commission is the basic amount. In determining the basic amount the Commission takes into account the value of sales of the undertaking and the duration of the infringement adding to them the so-called “entry fee” i.e. a sum of between 15 and 25 percent of the value of sales. This additional amount is added irrespective of the duration of the infringement. The setting of the basic amount represents the main change in the fining method compared to the 1998 Guidelines which provided that once the value of sales are defined these have to be increased by 10 percent rather than multiplied by the number of years as under the 2006 Guidelines.

1. The Value of Sales

The value of sales represents the first and most important element to be assessed when determining the basic amount. Indeed it represents the basis for both the value of sales itself as well as for the determination of the so-called “entry fee.”

Pursuant to point 13 of the 2006 Guidelines the Commission considers “the value of the undertaking’s sales of goods or services to which the infringement directly or indirectly relates in the relevant geographic area within the EEA.” The Commission normally takes into account the sales made by the undertaking during the last full business year of its participation in the infringement using the best available figures provided by the undertaking i.e. official or audited. However this will not be the case where sales during the last year are clearly not representative of the undertaking’s size or activity (e.g. substantial sale or acquisition relevant change of geographic scope significant fluctuations of revenues etc.)3 Further should these figures appear to be incomplete or unreliable the Commission may recur to partial figures obtained or any other relevant information (e.g. data collected during inspections or publicly available general market information). Also where the value of sales by undertakings participating in the infringement is similar but not identical the Commission may set an identical basic amount for each of them. Moreover in determining the basic amount of the fine the Commission will use rounded figures.4

The value of sales will be assessed before VAT and other taxes directly related to the sales. Eventually where the infringement of an association relates to the activities of its members the value of sales will generally correspond to the sum of the value of sales by its members.5

As for geographic scope the Commission will consider sales based on the territory in which the infringement took place i.e. the whole EEA or one or more Member States. That said should the infringement extend beyond the territory of the EEA the Commission may apply the worldwide market shares of each player to the total EEA sales. These sales will in fact better reflect the weight of each undertaking in the overall infringement.6

2. The Variable Amount

Once the value of sales established the Commission determines the variable amount that is a proportion of the value of sales depending on the degree of gravity of the infringement multiplied by the number of years of infringement.7

As for the proportion of the value of sales the Commission sets a percentage ranging from 0 to 30 percent depending on the gravity of the infringement. In order to assess this the authority considers a series of elements including the nature of the infringement its geographic scope the combined market share of all the undertakings concerned and whether or not the infringement has been implemented (the latter two points representing novelties to the 1998 Guidelines). To help set the percentage the Commission provides (in point 23) some examples of conducts where the higher range generally applies such as horizontal price-fixing market-sharing and output-limitation agreements. The broad range of percentages available to the Commission represents a novelty to the 1998 Guidelines where infringements were simply classified as minor serious and very serious. The absence of categorization in the 2006 Guidelines may explain such a broad range of percentages which allows the Commission to capture different degrees of infringement.8 Being based on the assessment of the overall infringement the percentage chosen applies to all parties in contrast to elements peculiar to a single undertaking which are assessed at the level of “adjustment factors.”

In practice the Commission has generally applied a gravity percentage of between 15 and 17 percent for most cases with 15% being the lowest ever applied. Conversely non-cartel cases have benefitted from importantly lower percentages i.e. between 2 and 11 percent.9 The gravity percentage has generally been applied to all participants in the infringement unless the infringements were multiple.10 That said on three occasions the Commission justified a different application of gravity percentages to participants in the same cartel. In Prestressing steel for example the Commission applied three different percentages (16 18 and 19 percent) taking into account the differences in geographic scope of the infringement between companies.11 Further in Mounting for windows and window-doors the Commission applied a 1 percent lower gravity percentage to AGB considering that the company did not participate in the full extension of the cartel at an EEA-level – but only in Italy – so that the surcharge to the basic amount applied to all other participants was not justified.12 Eventually in Power cables the Commission considered that six undertakings deserved a 2 percent increase to the 17 percent gravity factor applied to the others because of their participation in a further allocation mechanism linked to the main cartel. According to the authority in fact this part of the cartel “increased the harm to competition already caused by the market sharing agreement between the European Japanese and Korean producers and therefore the gravity of the infringement.” As a consequence the further distortion caused by the European cartel configuration justified an increase in the gravity percentage of 2 percent for those undertakings that participated in that aspect of the cartel.13

The highest gravity percentage ever applied was in the Marine Hoses cartel where the Commission set a 25 percent gravity percentage based on the fact that the cartel was a “multi-faceted cartel involving the allocation of tenders (bid rigging) fixing prices fixing quotas fixing sales conditions geographic market sharing and the exchange of sensitive information on prices sales volumes and procurement tenders.” The Commission underlined that horizontal price and quota fixing tender allocation and geographic market sharing are by their very nature among the most harmful restrictions of competition as these practices distort competition with regard to its main parameters. In addition in this case the combined market share of the parties was 90% and the geographic scope practically worldwide.14

Given the importance of gravity percentages in the calculation of the fine undertakings have often challenged them before EU courts with the aim of obtaining reductions however with no success so far.15

As a second step the Commission determines the duration i.e. the period from beginning of the infringement to its termination for each company separately.16 This number will then be multiplied by the amount resulting from the percentage of the value of sales.

Compared to the 1998 Guidelines the calculation of the duration has become more disadvantaging for companies. Indeed periods of less than six months are counted as half years and periods longer than six months but shorter than a year are counted as a full year which was not the case in the past. As a consequence every year of participation is fully reflected in the basic amount of the fine in line with the Commission’s wish that duration should play as big a role as possible in the assessment of fines.17

As for practice the Commission generally applies a single multiplier for each participant in an infringement. That said multipliers are often different as they depend on the duration of the participation of the single company involved. The Commission has also applied various multipliers where a company participated in a plurality of infringements in the same cartel.18 The same rules apply to non-cartel cases.19

Differently from gravity percentages the General Court has often upheld applicant’s requests to annul the Commission’s decisions regarding duration. Most cases were based on the failure to prove the applicant’s participation in the relevant period.20 Interestingly in two cases this was based on incorrect assessment of the relationship between parent company and subsidiary. In particular in Parker Hannifin Manufacturing Srl v. Commission the General Court held that a company cannot be held responsible for infringements committed independently by its subsidiaries before the date of their acquisition. The Commission had attributed to ITR’s subsidiary ITR Rubber (later Parker ITR) the responsibility for the entire duration of the cartel even though it had been transferred to Parker Hannifin. Along the same lines the Commission had also increased the basic amount of the fine by 30 percent on the basis of the aggravating circumstance of the leading role played by ITR over the same period despite Parker-Hannifin having had no economic or structural links with ITR or its subsidiaries. The General Court rejected the Commission’s arguments and reduced the fine accordingly.21 Further in UTi Worldwide Inc. and Others v. Commission the General Court upheld the applicant’s request to reduce the duration multiplier considering that the rounding down of the duration of the subsidiaries’ participation had resulted in a combined reduction of about one month in their favor but had not been accorded to the parent company. The General Court observed that in a situation where the liability of a parent company is purely derivative of that of its subsidiary the liability of said parent company cannot exceed that of its subsidiary.22

3. The Entry Fee

Absent from previous guidelines the entry fee represents one of the new introductions to the 2006 Guidelines. The aim of such a fee is to discourage undertakings from entering into horizontal price-fixing market-sharing and output limitation agreements or other illegal behavior by adding irrespective of the duration of the undertaking’s participation in the infringement a percentage of between 15 and 25 percent of the value of sales to the basic amount. In order to set this percentage the Commission considers several factors but mainly the same used to determine the proportion of the value of sales.23 The percentage applied reflects – as for the variable amount – the gravity of the infringement. Further the percentage chosen applies only once and equally to all parties to the infringement. That said the entry fee does not apply for infringements of less than six months. Another important difference relates to the application of the entry fee to cartels compared to other infringements. Indeed while the entry fee always applies to cartel cases it may only apply to other illegal conduct depending on its effects on the market. That said the Commission’s practice seems to arise no objections so far in this regard probably explained by the systematic alignment of the entry fee to the gravity percentage.24

As mentioned above the Commission has in practice systematically applied the same percentage to both gravity and entry fee except in the very first three cartel cases to which the 2006 Guidelines were applied notably Professional videotape25 Flat glass26 and Chloroprene rubber.27 That said the Commission unfortunately does not explain the reasons behind the application of such different percentages. As for non-cartel cases the Commission has rarely applied an entry fee. The only examples so far are the 10 and 16 percent entry fees applied in Lundbeck28 and Fentanyl29 respectively. In both cases the Commission considered the application of the entry fee to be justified on the basis of the gravity of the infringement (i.e. horizontal market-exclusion agreements which are “by object” restrictions of competition).

As with gravity percentages entry fees were often the subject of disputes before EU courts with no success so far.30

B. The Adjustment Factors

Once the basic amount is set the Commission will consider circumstances that result in an increase or decrease of the basic amount.31 These adjustment factors were not subject to major changes compared to the 1998 Guidelines (except for the inclusion of improper gains into aggravating circumstances rather than deterrence). Indeed the 2006 Guidelines mainly continue to reflect the developments of both case-law and the Commission’s practice over the years.

1. Aggravating Circumstances

Pursuant to point 28 of the 2006 Guidelines the basic amount of the fine may be increased where the Commission finds the existence of aggravating circumstances.32 The text contains a non-exhaustive list of potential aggravating circumstances thus implying that circumstances mentioned in the 1998 Guidelines and absent from the 2006 Guidelines including retaliatory measures taken against other undertakings continue to be relevant when determining the fines.

(i) An increase of the basic amount up to 100 percent for each infringement where an undertaking continues or repeats the same or a similar infringement after the Commission or a national competition authority has made the finding.

This point represents a novelty compared to the old guidelines. Indeed the increase has been amended to reach up to 100 percent (compared to the previous 50 percent increase) underlining the seriousness and thus the increased impact of the fine on repeated offenders. In addition every previous infringement now justifies an increase of the fine that is “multi-recidivists” will face even heavier fines. Further the Commission will base its assessment not only on its own past decisions but also on decisions by national competition authorities in line with the increased harmonization of EU and national antitrust rules introduced by Council Regulation No 1/2003.

This aggravating circumstance has been the most applied by the Commission so far with increases of 50 or 60 percent33 with 50 percent the minimum ever applied. That said only on two occasions did the Commission go beyond the 60 percent increase applying an increase of 90 percent34 and only once of 100 percent which represents the maximum as of today. In the latter case the 100 percent exceptional increase on Akzo Nobel was justified on the basis of numerous and repeated cartel infringements – in different sectors – which clearly showed that the first penalties did not sufficiently prompt the undertaking to change its conduct.35 As for non-cartel cases the Commission has never made use of any aggravating circumstances with the exception of Mastercard II where the basic amount of the fine was increased by 50 percent considering the existence of a previous infringement of a similar nature.36 In this case the Commission further underlined that the fact that it did not impose any fine on Mastercard in 2007 did not prevent it from increasing the basic amount of the fine with regard to the previous infringement.

As for court cases only on three occasions did the General Court annulled or modify the increases applied to undertakings on the basis of “repeated infringement.” In Versalis & Eni v. Commission for example the fine on Eni was reduced from 60 to 50 percent based on the principle of equal treatment which imposes the application of the same percentage to companies which both have one previous infringement (i.e. Bayer).37 Further in Eni v. Commission the General Court upheld the applicant’s request not to increase the fine based on repeated infringement. In particular the General Court observed that as Eni was not an addressee of the Polypropylene decision or of the PVC II decision it was given no opportunity in the administrative procedures leading to the adoption of those decisions to adduce evidence capable of rebutting the presumption that the parent company did in fact exercise a decisive influence over its subsidiary on the basis of which the Commission had established repeated infringement on its part. As a consequence the fine was recalculated without the 60 percent increase for repeated infringement.38 Eventually in Saint-Gobain Glass France and Others v. Commission the General Court found that the repetition of unlawful infringement by Saint-Gobain and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain was less serious than stated by the Commission considering that the basic amount of the fine was justified in light of both the Flat glass (Benelux) decision and the Flat glass (Italy) decision. Since only the first of those decisions could be applied for the purpose of establishing repeated infringement and since in addition that decision was further removed in time from the beginning of the infringement referred to in the contested decision the percentage of the increase on grounds of repeated infringement was reduced from 60 to 30 percent.39

(ii) Refusal to cooperate with or obstruction of the Commission in carrying out its investigations.

This aggravating circumstance is extremely rare and has only been applied once in practice notably in Professional videotape the first cartel case to which the 2006 Guidelines have been applied. In this occasion the Commission applied a 30% increase on Sony considering that during the inspections carried out on May 28 and 29 2002 the undertaking refused to answer oral questions while an employee shredded documents from a file labelled “Competitors Pricing.” According to the Commission Sony’s behavior clearly and necessarily disrupted the proper conduct of the investigation and hindered the Commission’s inspectors in the exercise of their investigative powers.40 As for court cases no cases concerning the refusal to cooperate or obstruction have been challenged before EU courts so far.

(iii) Role of leader in or instigator of the infringement; the Commission will also pay particular attention to any steps taken to coerce other undertakings to participate in the infringement and/or any retaliatory measures taken against other undertakings with a view to enforcing the practices constituting the infringement.

This aggravating circumstance has only been applied twice by the Commission so far. In Candle waxes the Commission justified a 50 percent increase on Sasol for one (out of two) infringements based on its leading role in the cartel activity (e.g. chairman and spokesman at meetings responsible for sending cartel-related invitations and follow-up with other members etc.)41 Similarly in Marine hoses the Commission applied a 30 percent increase on Bridgestone and Parker ITR considering their leading role in the cartel meetings.42

As for court cases in only one occasion the Commission upheld the applicant’s request to decrease the fine applied on the basis of this aggravating circumstance. Indeed in Parker Hannifin Manufacturing Srl v. Commission the Commission had increased the basic amount of the fine by 30 percent on the basis of the role of leader played by ITR in the cartel. However the General Court held that a company cannot be held responsible for infringements committed independently by its subsidiaries before the date of their acquisition which was the case here as Parker-Hannifin had no economic or structural links with ITR or its subsidiaries at the time of the infringement. As a consequence the General Court rejected the Commission’s arguments and reduced the fine.43

Despite the open nature of the aggravating circumstances listed in the 2006 Guidelines the Commission has – so far – never made use of any other aggravating circumstances to justify basic amount increases in antitrust infringements.

2. Mitigating Circumstances

Similarly to aggravating circumstances the Commission provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of scenarios in which it may reduce the basic amount on the basis of mitigating circumstances. In order to benefit from these reductions the undertaking concerned has to prove the existence of such circumstances to the Commission which means the burden on proof will rely on the author of the infringement. Practice shows that the Commission has often – or more often in any case – applied mitigating circumstances in antitrust infringements when compared to aggravating circumstances.

(i) Where the undertaking concerned provides evidence that it terminated the infringement as soon as the Commission intervened.

As underlined by the 2006 Guidelines this mitigating factor does not apply to secret agreements such as cartels considering the counterproductive effect this would create on undertakings. Undertakings would indeed be encouraged to infringe the law knowing they might always benefit from this mitigating circumstance by stopping their conduct as soon as – and only if – their infringement is discovered. As a consequence this attenuating circumstance has never been used by the Commission. The Commission applied it only once in non-cartel cases granting a 20 percent reduction to both participants in Telefonica/Portugal Telecom after considering that the termination of the contested clause took place only 16 days after the Commission initiated proceedings (30 days after the Commission sent its first request for information to the parties) and that the clause in question was not secret.44 As for court cases no cases concerning this mitigating circumstance have been challenged before EU courts so far.

(ii) Where the undertaking provides evidence that the infringement has been committed as a result of negligence.

As under the previous guidelines this mitigating circumstance plays a very marginal role in the Commission’s practice. Indeed it has been recognized in only three cases where the percentages granted were 1 and 10 percent.45 In both Yen Interest Rate derivatives and Power cables the reduction was granted based on the Commission’s consideration of the lack of awareness of the undertakings’ participation in the cartel. As for court cases no cases concerning this mitigating circumstance have been upheld before EU courts so far.46

(iii) Where the undertaking provides evidence that its involvement in the infringement is substantially limited and thus demonstrates that during the period in which it was party to the offending agreement it actually avoided applying it by adopting competitive conduct in the market

A reduction of the fine might also be recognized if the undertaking can prove its limited role in the infringement. In particular the undertaking will have to provide evidence that it did not actually implement the illegal conduct agreed upon in the market. That said proving its limited participation in terms of duration will not be sufficient to benefit from the reduction as this will already be reflected in the basic amount of the fine duration being one of the elements considered when determining each party’s participation in the infringement. Still the General Court found in Novacke chemicke za vody that since the list of mitigating circumstances in the 2006 Guidelines is not exhaustive the fact that this list does not mention the passive role of an undertaking does not exclude that aspect from being taken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance. However the undertakings have to prove that the relative gravity of their participation in the infringement is less significant.47

This mitigating circumstance is by far the most applied by the Commission with percentages ranging between 5 and 20 percent. That said the 10 percent range appears to be the most common with application to approximately 15 undertakings in several cartels.48

As for court cases in a few occasions the EU courts reduced the fine on the basis of the undertaking’s limited involvement in a cartel. In Fresh Del Monte Produce v. Commission for example the General Court increased the reduction from 10 to 20 percent on account of the fact that the applicant participated in only one aspect of the overall cartel.49 Further in Campine v. Commission where the General Court did not agree with the Commission which in order not to grant Campine a reduction of more than 5 percent wanted to rely on the fact that Campine’s limited presence on the market was already taken into account when determining the basic amount of its fine. The latter was indeed based on the value of the purchases made by each of the cartel participants and would thus – if such a reduction were applied – no longer have a sufficient deterrent effect. According to the General Court such approach could not be accepted since it amounted to treating a small market operator more severely than a larger market operator. As a consequence the reduction was increased from 5 to 8 percent.50

(iv) where the undertaking concerned has effectively cooperated with the Commission outside the scope of the Leniency Notice and beyond its legal obligation to do so

Another element that might be considered by the Commission in relation to the fine reduction is the effective cooperation of the undertaking. However as pointed out by the Commission in the 2006 Guidelines the reduction does not apply to all cooperation but only to cooperation that is relevant plays outside the scope of the Leniency notice and goes beyond the undertaking’s legal obligation to cooperate. The Commission will evaluate the existence of these elements on a case-by-case basis.

As for the mitigating circumstance mentioned under (ii) this mitigating circumstance plays a rather limited role in the Commission’s practice. Indeed it has been recognized in only six cases where the percentages granted were 5 15 and 18 percent.51 As for non-cartel cases this circumstance does obviously not apply.

The General Court has set very demanding standards in this regard. In Ecka for example the General Court refused to reduce the fine on the grounds put forward by the applicant that it had not contested the facts. The General Court pointed out that this circumstance was not listed in the 2006 Guidelines and held that the Commission was not required to grant a reduction.52 The General Court read this provision restrictively by limiting its scope to the circumstances expressly listed. It found that the lack of contestation had not facilitated the establishment of the infringement by the Commission.53

Indeed no cases concerning this mitigating circumstance have been upheld before EU courts so far. That said in Fresh Del Monte Produce v. Commission the General Court granted a 10 percent reduction to Weichert for cooperation during the administrative procedure.54 However this reduction was reversed by the Court of Justice in the appeal by finding that the response to the request for information did not justify a reduction of the fine as the applicant merely replied to a simple request for information and did not provide information to the Commission without having been requested to do so.55

(v) Where the anti-competitive conduct of the undertaking has been authorized or encouraged by public authorities or by legislation.

Finally the fact that the illegal conduct of the undertaking has been authorized or encouraged by public authorities or by legislation may also represent an element to justify decreasing the level of the fine. The Commission underlines that this applies without prejudice to any action that may be taken against the Member State concerned.56

In practice the Commission granted this reduction in only one case so far. Indeed in Airfreight the Commission applied a 10 percent reduction on all participants recognizing that some regulatory regimes had encouraged certain elements of the anticompetitive conduct.57

As for court cases the General Court upheld the applicant’s request for reduction of the fine based on this mitigating circumstance in only one non-cartel case. Specifically in Ordre National des Pharmaciens en France (ONP) the applicant claimed that the Commission did not take into account the fact that its conducts were authorized or encouraged by a French decree. The Commission had found that the ONP had first applied a minimum price policy and second systematically chosen to interpret the law in the manner most unfavorable to opening the market to groups of laboratories and opposed legal arrangements that were consistent with the law. As regards this second finding the General Court held that the Commission had been wrong not to acknowledge that there was a circular that would have had an impact on ONP’s conduct. The Commission’s error concerned only one of the four series of acts designed to prevent the development of groups of laboratories for a certain period. In consequence the General Court granted a minor reduction of the fine.58

Differently from the aggravating circumstances the Commission has often relied on additional motivations – to the ones listed in the 2006 Guidelines – to justify a decrease of the fine. In Car battery recycling and Spark plugs for example the Commission granted a 10 percent reduction on the basis of lack of evidence.59 In two other instances the reduction was granted on the basis of the specific regulatory regime of a certain market sector. This was the case in Bananas and Exotic fruit (bananas) where the Commission applied a 60 and 20 percent reduction respectively considering the very specific characteristics of the sector involved.60 As for non-cartel cases these exceptional mitigating circumstances have only been used once in Lundbeck where the long duration of the Commission’s investigation justified a 10 percent reduction for all participants.61 As for court cases no cases concerning exceptional mitigating circumstances have been upheld before EU courts so far.62

3. Increase for Deterrence

In setting the fine the Commission will also have to ensure that it has a sufficient deterrent effect on the undertakings which may not be the case for instance if the undertaking is a big player on the market. In order to prevent an insufficient impact the Commission has the possibility of increasing the fine: (i) on undertakings which have a particularly large turnover beyond the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates (a so called “multiplier”); or (ii) in order to exceed the amount of gains improperly made as a result of the infringement where it is possible to estimate that amount.63

With regard to the multiplier already developed under the previous guidelines (even if part of the assessment of gravity) its function is meant to correct the effects of the basic amount calculation for large multi-product undertakings. Indeed by only considering the value of sales in relation to the infringement the fine might feel insignificant compared to the undertaking’s overall ability to pay and thus not be discouraging enough.

The Commission has often made use of deterrence multipliers to discourage and condemn illegal conduct by undertakings. In the vast majority of cases (including non-cartel cases) it used a 1.1 or 1.2 multiplier64 while only rarely was the multiplier between 1.4 and 2.65 Exceptionally in two cases the Commission applied a percentage instead of a multiplier i.e. 10 and 70 percent.66

As for improper gains already developed under the previous guidelines (even if part of the assessment of aggravating circumstances) this clause aims to prevent a scenario where the fine set by the Commission would not even correspond to the infringing undertaking’s gains and thus not be sufficiently deterrent. That said this element should be considered by the Commission only where possible or relevant. In practice the Commission does not seem to have ever justified an increase of an antitrust infringement sanction based specifically on improper gains.

As for court cases no cases concerning deterrence – i.e. with regard to both multiplier and improper gains – have been upheld before EU courts so far.67

4. Legal Maximum Leniency and Settlement

Despite several amendments which followed the introduction of the 2006 Guidelines some of the elements such as legal maximum leniency and settlement were not affected as deriving either from Article 23 of Regulation No 1/2003 or other specific legislation.

With regard to the legal maximum points 32 and 33 of the 2006 Guidelines set a limit to the overall fine to be applied to undertakings which should not exceed 10 percent of their total turnover in the preceding business year. It further underlines that for infringements by an association of undertakings the 10 percent should be calculated based on the sum of the total turnover of each member active on the market affected by that infringement.

In practice the Commission has so far applied this reduction to 40 companies in several cartels but never to non-cartel cases.68 As for court cases in only a few occasions has the General Court upheld instances relating to the legal maximum. In particular in Sasol and Others v. Commission the General Court upheld the applicant’s request to reduce the amount of the fine to 10 percent of the applicant’s sales considering that the Commission incorrectly determined the relevant undertaking. The General Court found it appropriate to limit the part of the fine imposed on Sasol Wax and Schümann Sasol International on account of the infringement committed during the joint venture period to 10 percent of the turnover of Schümann Sasol International and reduced the fine.69 Similarly in Ori & SLM the General Court found that the amount of the fine would go beyond the legal maximum and reduced the fine on SLM to EUR 1.956 million.70

As for leniency the 2006 Guidelines simply refer back to the 2006 Leniency Notice which foresees further reductions of the fine up to 100 percent depending on the role and on the significance of the evidence provided by each undertaking involved in the infringement.71 The reductions will apply every time after the 10 percent legal maximum assessment in order to ensure that cooperation under the Leniency Notice is always rewarded.

In practice the Commission has applied leniency reductions ranging from 7 to 100 percent.72 Full immunity has been granted to whistleblowers in 52 cartels which suggests the existence of a rather consolidated cooperative approach between companies and the Commission and thus a successful application of the Leniency Notice tool. Along these lines it is interesting to note that only a minority of cartel cases were not reported to the Commission and among them in only one was leniency not granted to any member.73 As for non-cartel cases the Leniency Notice and the related reductions do not apply.

As for court cases the General Court upheld the applicant’s request to amend the leniency percentage granted in only a few occasions. In Evonik Degussa and AlzChem v. Commission for example the General Court partially upheld the applicant’s request to increase the reduction granted under the Leniency Notice from 20 to 30 percent by granting a reduction of 28 percent considering that the evidence submitted to the Commission by the applicants did not provide significant added value in relation to calcium carbide for which the Commission already had evidence at its disposal. Nevertheless the General Court concluded that it was right to choose a high level of reduction.74 Further in Donau Chemie v. Commission the General Court found that the Commission was wrong to apply the leniency reduction solely to the part of the fine relating to the part of the infringement in relation to which the applicant had provided evidence of significant added value. The General Court therefore annulled the 35 percent reduction of the fine and applied a reduction of 43.5 percent.75 Lastly in Wabco Europe and Others v. Commission the General Court upheld the applicant’s request to take partial immunity into account at the final stage of calculating the fine rather than before it applied the 10 percent of turnover ceiling considering that the grant of partial immunity is intended to encourage undertakings to provide the Commission with all the information and evidence in their possession concerning the infringement.76

Finally the undertaking will benefit from a 10 percent reduction in case of settlement. This provision is not part of the 2006 Guidelines but still represents a further reduction consideration for undertakings facing antitrust fines. In particular pursuant to the Settlement Notice where a company acknowledges its liability for the infringement indicates its willingness to accept a maximum fine and agrees to waive certain procedural rights (i.e. full access to the file and oral hearing) it is eligible to receive a 10 percent reduction of its fine.77

In practice the Commission has granted the 10 percent settlement reduction in 30 cartel cases the first being the DRAMS cartel in 2010.78 The decisional practice of the Commission shows a rather increasing trend in this regard with undertakings taking more and more advantage of this tool.79 Similarly to leniency settlement reductions do not apply to non-cartel cases. As for court cases no cases concerning settlement have been upheld before EU courts so far.80

5. Inability to Pay

Another element which may be considered to justify a fine reduction – even if rather exceptional – is the inability to pay. The Commission may in fact under certain social and economic circumstances and upon request of the undertaking concerned grant a reduction where the amount of the fine would “irretrievably jeopardise the economic viability of the undertaking concerned and cause its assets to lose all their value.”81 Such findings will need to be rooted on objective evidence and not merely on a difficult financial situation as this would entail an unjustified discrimination between undertakings.

In practice the Commission has rarely applied reductions due to inability to pay and the few cases where the reduction was granted have not published any information in this regard.82 In International removal services for example the Commission granted a 70 percent reduction to Interdean on the basis of comprehensive evidence provided by the undertaking which demonstrated the special circumstances concerning the individual situation of Interdean and its parent companies.83 Further in Refrigeration compressors ACC’s fine was reduced to EUR 9 million (i.e. by approx. 67 percent) considering that the company had shown that application of the fine in the full amount would irretrievably jeopardize its economic viability and cause its assets to lose their value. Indeed the company’s distressed financial situation had brought it under the insolvency scheme of Italian bankruptcy law and the fine would have frustrated the ongoing financial restructuring of the group hence leading to its insolvency.84

Along these lines in 1.garantovana the General Court held that an applicant was barred from relying on these grounds when it had decided to terminate its activity and sell its assets.85 In addition the mere fact that the imposition of a fine might give rise to the undertaking’s bankruptcy is not sufficient to apply paragraph 35 of the 2006 Guidelines. The undertaking must in fact fulfil the cumulative conditions set out in this provision and establish: (i) that the fine would cause its assets to lose their value (an acquisition by another undertaking is unlikely and its assets would be unlikely to find a buyer if sold separately) and (ii) the particular economic and social context which could lead to an increase in unemployment or to a deterioration of the economic sectors upstream or downstream.86

Reductions due to inability to pay are thus to be interpreted in a strict sense. Accordingly the General Court has increased the Commission’s duty to state reasons when undertakings submit detailed information that specifically aims at proving that these conditions are met. Accordingly where the Commission intends to reach a different conclusion it is required to provide at least a brief summary of the evidence and findings substantiating its conclusion if the information submitted is sufficiently focused on the conditions of paragraph 35. The Commission is obligated to explain why a declaration of bankruptcy would jeopardize the undertaking’s economic viability and cause its assets to lose all their value.87]

As for non-cartel cases reductions due to inability to pay have never been applied so far. Similarly to this day no cases concerning inability to pay have been upheld before EU courts.88

6. The Commission’s Discretion Under Point 37

Despite the development of a step-by-step methodology for setting antitrust fines the 2006 Guidelines foresee a “safety clause” which allows the Commission to depart from the given guidance (including the limits specified under point 21) where this is justified by the “particularities of a given case or the need to achieve deterrence.”

This possibility has been upheld by EU courts allowing the Commission to adjust the fines to the individual circumstances of each undertaking in line with paragraph 37 of the 2006 Guidelines. Indeed a lack of flexibility could lead to disproportionate fines.

In its practice the Commission has in several instances made use of its discretion to grant increases or decreases of the fine on the basis of point 37. These were generally recognized for all participants (e.g. reduction due to length of the Commission investigation) unless justified by the existence of certain circumstances specific to a single undertaking.89 The percentages applied were always between 1 and 20 percent and only on one occasion was the fine increased due to the economic significance of the infringement.90 As for reductions on one occasion the fine was reduced by 20 percent91 in three occasions by 10 percent92 once by 5 percent93 and once by 1 percent.94 In a number of cases the motivation and/or the percentage of reduction applied was not published.95 As for non-cartel cases the Commission has always granted reductions of between 10% and 50% for cooperative behavior except in one case.96 Interestingly in Fentanyl the Commission recurred to point 37 to adapt the value of sales in the basic amount for Novartis/Sandoz taking into account the absence of sales by the undertaking in the geographic area concerned during the period of the infringement and the need to ensure deterrence.97

As for court cases the Commission’s decision concerning the application of point 37 has been annulled in only two occasions. In both instances the General Court considered that as the application of point 37 leaves a wide margin of appreciation to the Commission respecting the obligation to state reasons is of exceptional importance. In particular in Stührk Delikatessen Import v. Commission¸ the applicant claimed that the adjustment of the fine under point 37 of the Guidelines had been carried out by the Commission in a purely arbitrary manner. The Commission infringed the principle of equal treatment as it failed to take sufficient account of the actual participation of other undertakings in the calculation of their fines. Despite their major role in the cartel the other cartelists were granted a greater reduction than the applicant (80 percent). The applicant claimed that it should be granted a reduction of 90-95 percent. The General Court concluded that the grounds provided by the Commission didn’t allow the applicant to challenge this approach as regards the principle of equal treatment and partially annulled the Commission decision.98 Similarly in Pometon v. Commission the Commission’s decision was annulled for failure to state reasons.99

II. Conclusion

Under the current 2006 Guidelines a total of approximately 70 Article 101 decisions have been issued by the Commission. As seen throughout our review these guidelines allow companies to easily calculate and thus rather precisely predict the potential fines they could face in case of antitrust infringements. Indeed thanks to the Commission’s practice and EU case-law companies are able to foresee and estimate how often to what extent and when a certain element has been considered relevant or not by the authority or legislator. This foreseeability certainly represents a powerful tool for undertakings helping them avoid – or at least limit – the risks of heavy fines.

The existence of a rather numerous set of precedent cases provides today a useful framework for companies contemplating about antitrust infringements and fines. At the same time the European Commission constantly adapts its practice to the standards applied by the EU courts with the goal to avoiding the annulment of its decisions. Thus additional scrutiny applied by the courts may lead to better quality decisions from the Commission. In this sense it will be interesting for companies to closely follow future developments.

Pay Remains Stratospheric Even at Companies Battered by Pandemic (Published 2021),"Boeing had a historically bad 2020. Its 737 Max was grounded for most of the year after two deadly crashes the pandemic decimated its business and the company announced plans to lay off 30000 workers and reported a $12 billion loss. Nonetheless its chief executive David Calhoun was rewarded with some $21.1 million in compensation.

Norwegian Cruise Line barely survived the year. With the cruise industry at a standstill the company lost $4 billion and furloughed 20 percent of its staff. That didn’t stop Norwegian from more than doubling the pay of Frank Del Rio its chief executive to $36.4 million.

And at Hilton where nearly a quarter of the corporate staff were laid off as hotels around the world sat empty and the company lost $720 million it was a good year for the man in charge.

This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning April 25; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

Like many CEOs on the West Coast Dan Schulman has a sort of a uniform: blue jeans black sweater and ostrich-skin cowboy boots. When it came time to replace his boots Schulman the CEO of PayPal used one of the company’s new services to make the purchase. With a few clicks in a few seconds he bought the boots and paid for them with Bitcoin. “Boom” he says. “It was pretty cool.”

The fintech giant had a record year as the pandemic drove shoppers from stores. Instead they bought groceries movies and underwear on their phones and computers. PayPal does business in more than 200 countries and deals in more than 100 currencies. It did a staggering amount of business last year processing transactions at a rate of 1000 per second during the peak holiday shopping season. In total PayPal processed 15.4 billion payments with a value of $936 billion last year. PayPal also had the most new product launches in its history including launching QR-code payments in 20 markets around the world in response to demand for germ-free transactions. Another big initiative: helping move digital currency into the mainstream by adding cryptocurrency services. Schulman recently joined TIME for a conversation on the future of cash central banks and the security of digital currency.

(This interview is edited and condensed for clarity.)

How much did fear of infection during the pandemic drive lasting changes in how people shop and pay for things?

There were two things that dramatically accelerated the trend of digital payments by as little as three years and maybe as much as five years. And by the way that’s just continuing to grow at an accelerating rate. The first is we had no choice. We were all quarantined in our homes. We needed to live. We needed to buy things and everybody had to buy things online. Eventually that turned from this necessity to convenience. People realized you don’t have to wait in line at a cashier; it can be delivered whenever you want you have more choice more different deals.

No. 2 is everything started to go digital even in-store because of hygiene. People wanted to be sure that they could protect their cashiers and customers wanted to be sure that they were going to be safe. Nobody wanted to touch cash and that led to a large increase in use of digital forms to not just pay but to look at menus and to look at offers and that kind of thing in stores.

What does your business look like in the next five to 10 years?

First of all retail fundamentally changes. It moves from a strategy of How do I attract people to my storefront? to basically How do I optimize for home delivery? How do I optimize around all things digital online and offline? Effectively the differentiation between those two things disappears. And that means that retailers need to think about Where do they meet consumers? Consumers aren’t just going to go to their website. They’re going to be in large consumer platforms like TikTok or PayPal or others. The reason Walmart wanted to buy part of TikTok is they wanted to kind of put shopping into that platform. We call it contextual commerce.

It’s the same thing inside PayPal. We know that people will start to utilize wish-list shopping tools and wish lists are really a form of creating an individualized demand curve. This is what you want. This is the price point that you want it; retailer if you can give me that I’ll buy it. And so retailers are coming to where you are looking individually personalizing offers to you. Retail is going to shift dramatically.

And how are we going to pay for things?

There are probably going to be six to 10 superapps that evolve. You won’t have 50 apps on your phone because you can’t remember 50 usernames and passwords; you don’t want to put in your financial information into every single one of them; you can’t remember the nav system on all of them. These superapps that will basically intermediate other apps so you log in once you have a common password you have all of your data and information in one place that can be used to feed products and services on that platform. It will make it simpler and easier for the consumer.

So cash is no longer king?

Ten years from now you will see a tremendous decline in the use of cash. All form factors of payment will collapse into the mobile phone. Credit cards as a form factor will go away and you will use your phone because a phone can add much more value than just tapping your credit card. And so when all of those things start to happen then central banks need to rethink monetary policy as well because you can’t just issue more paper money into the system because people aren’t using paper money. And so this is the advent of digital currencies.

What does this pending shift to digital currencies mean for the financial system as we know it?

In the next five to 10 years you’re going to see more change in the financial system than you have over the past 10 to 20 years. How do we think about modernizing the existing financial infrastructure? It needs modernization because it’s inefficient today. If you cash a check it can take three days for you to get your money. If you do an international remittance it can take seven days to get your money. And it’s too expensive. The “take rate” across the financial system throughout the world is about 2.8%. For the last 10 years which by the way you’d expect with volume and technological improvements that would drop but the worst part about the 2.8% is that if you have less income or are outside of the system and you’re not affluent then that take rate is like 1000 basis points; it’s not 280 basis points. And if you’re really affluent the take rate is 25 basis points. And so when you think about it being expensive exclusionary and efficient we really need to start to think about How do you modernize that system? Is there a way that you can do things more efficiently with less cost more inclusively and add more utility into the system?

What is the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from central bank–issued digital currencies?

Central bank–issued digital currencies can also take advantage of distributed ledger technology [DLT] or other modern technologies but they’re basically digitizing a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. A digital dollar would be fully backed by the U.S. government but done in a digital fashion and that might allow the government to open up Fed funding to other institutions besides banks potentially companies like PayPal where you could fund straight from the Fed right into a digital wallet. You wouldn’t have to send out stimulus checks in the mail—just go directly into their digital wallet through a digital currency instantaneous access no cost and friction.

Demand on the crypto side has been multiple-fold to what we initially expected. There's a lot of excitement. - Array

You’ve taken a very deliberate approach to digital currency investing heavily before introducing a consumer product. Why now?

We’ve been looking at digital forms of currency and DLT for six years or so. But I thought it was early and I thought the cryptocurrencies at the time were much more assets than they were currency. They were too volatile to be a viable currency. And it was still a little bit too much of people not really understanding what they were going to get into and what we really wanted to do is make sure that it became a little more mainstream so that we would work hand in hand with regulators before we put anything out into the market.

What’s the demand been like for these new services?

Demand on the crypto side has been multiple-fold to what we initially expected. There’s a lot of excitement.

How do we defend against more and more sophisticated cybercrime as all our assets move to digital?

We need to battle cyber in two ways. One you have to create wide moats and high towers and turrets to try and keep as many bad people out as possible. But it’s impossible to keep bad people out because usernames and passwords are stolen. So the real trick of this is how do you keep data from moving outside. So if you make a transaction [using PayPal] it’s not your username and password that’s giving you permission to do that. It is 130 different variables that we look at on every single transaction in milliseconds to be sure that it’s you. It’s this idea of Big Data of really understanding who you are not who you said you are. Things like two-factor authentication that’s grade-school stuff. It needs to be much much more sophisticated than that and we’ve spent as much as we need to spend to ensure that we do our very best to not allow data to leave our system that isn’t valid. But I will say this for every company around the world: this is an issue that should be front and center.

When did you decide on your look?

I don’t really call it a look. I call it very comfortable. I started this when I was running Virgin Mobile a long time ago. I’ve been wearing cowboy boots forever. I’ve been wearing jeans and like a black sweater forever. Some people say “Oh you went to Silicon Valley.” No no. This was me way before then.

But as a Connecticut middle school teacher who may owe a $16000 tax bill for his Facebook fundraiser discovered easy can come with costly complications.

There are some considerations before you create a campaign. Toby Mathis a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas has some helpful tips.

Mathis said it's perfectly fine to raise funds online either through a website or one of the many online apps available including Facebook GoFundMe PayPal Venmo Cash or Zelle. Just make sure that you're aware of any disclaimers.

For example Facebook's policy states that any funds received through a personal fundraiser on the social media platform may be taxable and that if more than $20000 is raised a 1099-K form from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will be issued by Stripe a company that processes payments for personal fundraisers on Facebook.

Taxed for Facebook fundraiser:One do-gooder got 'huge shock' after huge tax bill

Unemployment $10200 tax break: Some may need to amend returns for tax refunds

And GoFundMe states its fundraisers are ""usually considered to be personal gifts which for the most part aren’t taxed as income"" but there are some exceptions.

GoFundMe adds there may be ""particular case-specific instances where the income is in fact taxable for organizers"" that depend on the amounts received and how the funds are used.

Rick Cohen chief operating officer and spokesman for the National Council of Nonprofits hopes Louis Goffinet the teacher who raised over $40000 in a fundraiser on Facebook to help buy groceries for neighbors struggling during the pandemic doesn't have to pay the price for simply doing a good deed. Cohen said that using third-party platforms like Facebook to get funds meant Goffinet actually received personal income since he doesn't have an accredited nonprofit and the donations are currently not considered tax-deductible.

Cohen said he can only imagine how Goffinet was surprised that his gesture online was able to help so many in need during an unprecedented time.

""It’s really an unfortunate thing"" Cohen said. ""This person had the best of intentions of raising money for other people and it might not end up not working out so well.""

Cohen and both Facebook and GoFundMe recommend talking to a tax professional just to be sure when considering fundraising online. Here's what Mathis suggests considering:

1. What's the intent of the fundraiser and the reason for it. ""You want to make sure you’re very clear about why you are raising money and who or what is it for"" Mathis said.

2. If you're raising money for somebody else state clearly whether you're not a charity or a nonprofit. Also make sure to note whether there any exchange of goods or services related to the campaign. For example if donors get a coffee mug for a donation the money given is taxable. If donors didn't receive anything in return for their donation then it is considered a gift and not taxable. ""If you are just giving to a fundraiser out of kindness it’s just considered a gift"" Mathis said.

3. If you’re going to raise a lot of money for people and you’re drawn to it consider forming a charity or a nonprofit to solicit the funds in a more formal way. You can also consider partnering or joining a recognized nonprofit that already has tax-exempt status.

""If you’re passionate about raising money and really love helping people the world needs more people like you"" Mathis said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L3Nhbi1qb3NlLWVhcnRocXVha2VzLXdlbGNvbWUtZmFucy1iYWNrLXdpdGgtd2luLWluLWhvbWUtb3BlbmVyL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L3Nhbi1qb3NlLWVhcnRocXVha2VzLXdlbGNvbWUtZmFucy1iYWNrLXdpdGgtd2luLWluLWhvbWUtb3BlbmVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,San Jose Earthquakes welcome fans back with win in home opener,"SAN JOSE – The Earthquakes home opener Saturday served as a breakout performance for forward Cade Cowell.

The 17-year-old had a goal and a spectacular assist in the second half as San Jose beat FC Dallas 3-1 in the first professional sporting event with fans in Santa Clara County since March 2020.

Centerback Oswaldo Alanis and midfielder Cristian Espinoza also scored as the Earthquakes (1-1-0) bounced back from a 2-1 loss at Houston in the season opener.

Cowell is most known for his speed but he showed off his passing with a through ball that freed up Espinoza for a breakaway goal in the 49th minute. The attacker then added his own goal 10 minutes later evading two defenders and shooting through traffic into the lower left corner to make the score 3-0.

“You can tell the more he plays the more confident he becomes” Quakes winger Carlos Fierro said through an interpreter. “You can see he contributes on goals and assists so I definitely see him as a player who can make that jump to Europe soon.”

Cowell who wasn’t made available for postgame interviews grew up outside of Modesto and signed as a homegrown player in 2019. He became the youngest player in club history to start and the youngest to score a goal when he debuted last August at 16.

He finished 2020 with one goal and one assist in 17 appearances but coach Matias Almeyda made him a starter ahead of all-time leading scorer Chris Wondolowski and veteran Andy Rios to start this year. Cowell matched his scoring totals from last year on Saturday.

“He’s improved over the past two years by leaps and bounds” goalie JT Marcinkowski said. “And he’s nowhere close to how good he can be which is great for us because he’s going to keep getting better. We’re all so happy for him and really just ready for more.”

Cowell’s showcase game added to the celebratory atmosphere at newly-renamed PayPal Park. The team did not announce an attendance number but 3600 tickets were sold approximately 20 percent of the stadium’s capacity to allow for social distancing.

“(Fans) are the heartbeat of this club” Marcinkowski said. “Their passion their noise their intensity throughout the game it’s what gives us the extra boost. The fans are what makes the game so special.”

The added energy didn’t help at the start as the Quakes were almost burned a few times while trying to play methodically from the back line. Marcinkowski and Alanis both had balls stolen from them in their own box in the first few minutes and FC Dallas defender Bressan hit the crossbar with a header off a corner kick.

“I told players (when they) make the mistakes have the character to repeat that play because that’s the only way to grow” Almeyda said through an interpreter. “So I value those two mistakes we had but I also value greatly the braveness that they have to try it again.”

The Earthquakes regrouped and earned two penalty kicks later in the half. Espinoza missed from the spot in the 18th minute but Alanis converted his penalty 16 minutes later.

Fierro had the defensive play of the game when he raced back from his position on the right wing to kick the ball off the goal line in the 37th minute and keep the Quakes ahead.

“It’s a representation of the team spirit that we have” Marcinkowski said. “Everyone is willing to work for each other and do the dirty work. Like Matias says ‘Everybody runs everybody plays.’ ”

Ricardo Pepi eventually scored on a rebound in the 79th minute for FC Dallas (0-1-1) to finish the scoring.

Wondolowski entered midway through the second half. He received a red card for a late challenge in the 89th minute so he will be suspended for the next game Saturday at home against D.C. United.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h6aW0uY28uencvMjAyMS8wNC9pdHMtb3Zlci1za3JpbGwtZmluYWxseS1zaHV0cy1kb3duLXppbWJhYndlYW4tYWNjb3VudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's over: Skrill finally shuts down Zimbabwean accounts,"It’s official Zimbabwean Skrill accounts are no more. Most accounts were closed overnight and when their owners tried to log in they got an error message informing them that the relevant account had been closed. Skrill had said the accounts would be closed on the 20th of April.



Error messages seen by those who tried to log into their accounts today

A lot of Zimbabweans kept involved in online Forex Trade and gambling had hoped against all evidence to the contrary that Skrill would give them a reprieve. That was never going to happen despite accidental acts on Skrill’s parts such as allowing accounts to operate after the 20 April date and sending customers promotional messages. Thankfully it seems no one still had money in Skrill when the accounts were closed.

What is Skrill and why is it an important service?

So people have been asking me about Skrill and why I keep writing about it. Well Skrill is sort of like PayPal except it’s a lot better in my view in terms of what you can do with it. Like PayPal you can use Skrill to receive payments from all over the world and even use it as a payment gateway on your website provided you have a Skrill Business account.

Those who receive funds can actually withdraw the funds to their bank account. Yes when Skrill was still offering services to Zimbabweans you could actually add your Nostro USD account and have the funds deposited in there.

While PayPal is very picky about what you can do with funds in their wallet Skrill was specifically set up to serve some of the services that PayPal would turn its nose at. Things like online gambling betting and casinos as well as binary forex trading.

There is quite a small but vocal and passionate community of online foreign currency traders in Zimbabwe and some of them actually make a pretty decent living from these activities. Skrill was important to these people as they could use it to deposit and withdraw money into and from their trading or gambling wallets.

Skrill alternatives

The closing down of Zimbabwean Skrill accounts is just the latest slap in the face for Zimbabweans who want to engage in international trade and payments. That space keeps shrinking both due to a crumbling economy and the unintended fallout from sanctions. Ironically it’s very trivial for people targeted by sanctions to circumvent.

Now that Skrill is gone what are your options? Now that really depends on what you were using Skrill for. If you were a Skrill dealer who made their money buying and selling Skrill then you probably need to look at South Africa and see if you can open an account there you would need:

A South African phone number

An FNB non-resident account for when you want to withdraw Skrill funds

A valid passport for verification

You might also need a Visa/MasterCard and I would recommend BancABC if you want to add funds this way. I will not reveal why but just know if you do not have a South African card that can do international payments a BancABC prepaid Visa will serve you well

If you were using Skrill to make deposits into your trading or gambling account you can use a dealer instead. Chances are you already know a number of local dealers who do Deriv and Binary deposits for a fee of course.

You can also make use of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. We have already covered the topic of where you can get Bitcoin in Zimbabwe here.",,,

Ready to get your fix right now? Pepsi Blue isn't available quite yet but it's scheduled to hit shelves nationwide beginning on May 3 making it the perfect addition for your Memorial Day festivities. The delicious sip will be sold in single serve 20-ounce bottles both 16-ounce and 16.9-ounce six-packs and 16.9-ounce eight packs.

The company has installed capacity to produce 600 million aluminium beverage cans in a year. It utilised 74% of capacity in 2020 as it exported some 35% of its production to Afghanistan according to the company prospectus available at the PSX.

UK-based asset management firm Ashmore which holds 51% shareholding in PABC will sell almost half of its shareholding (ie 26% of the paid-up capital) to institutional rich individual and retail investors through book building and initial public offering (IPO) in June 2021.

The company aims to raise a minimum of Rs3.28 billion through the sale of 93.88 million shares at a floor price (minimum price) of Rs35 per share to investors at the bourse through the IPO.

The share price may move upwards by a maximum of 40% to Rs49 per share during the auction through book building.

The funds to be raised through book building will go to Ashmore which has planned to exit from the company. It will sell rest of its shareholding (ie 25%) in the company through private deals to other sponsors in the company.

""It (Ashmore) has also entered into agreements to sell 18052974 shares ie approximately 5% of the paid up capital of Company at a price of Rs30.80 per share to Hamida Salim Mukaty (part of Liberty Group) and 72221651 shares ie approximately 20% of the paid up capital of Company at a price of Rs31.85 to Soorty Enterprises (Private) Limited…by way of private placement"" according to the prospectus.

The company has established relationships with the key beverage bottlers in Pakistan and Afghanistan such as franchisees of PepsiCo Coca Cola Mehran Bottlers (Pakola) and Zalal Mowafaq Afghanistan.

In addition to this the company also supplies aluminium beverage cans to Nestle Pakistan Murree Brewery King Beverages Super Cola Beverages Sufi Group of Companies Six B Daani International Master Beverages & Foods and Afghan Red Pomegranate.

The sale of aluminium beverage cans is dependent upon the sale of soft drinks & other beverages.

The soft drinks market of Pakistan is expected to grow at a five-year CAGR of 6.7% as per Euromonitor International during the period 2020-2025 on the back of rising urbanisation favourable demographics and increased consumption.

As per company estimates the can penetration in the beverage packaging market is roughly 3-4%.

In addition to Afghanistan PABC has started supplying aluminium beverage cans to beverage producers based in Tajikistan and US and is currently negotiating trade terms with Pepsi Co USA while also exploring the possibilities to cater to other South Asian and Central Asian markets.

""PABC is currently the sole manufacturer of aluminium beverage cans in Pakistan with no direct competition in the industry.

Guidance on Second Pfizer Vaccine Doses,"Walgreens has inoculated hundreds of thousands of Americans against Covid-19 this year using the vaccine developed by Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. But the pharmacy chain has not been following guidance from federal health officials about the timing of second doses.

People are supposed to get two doses three weeks apart. Walgreens however separated them by four weeks because that made it faster and simpler for the company to schedule appointments.

There is no evidence that separating the doses by an extra week decreases the vaccine’s effectiveness. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a three-week gap the agency says it is acceptable to separate the doses by up to six weeks if necessary.

But Walgreens’s decision which it didn’t publicly announce confused some customers and caught the attention of federal health officials.

The vaccine developed by Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech is already a mainstay in international efforts to control the pandemic — and in Israel it has been nearly exclusively used to vaccinate the population — but it is a challenge to ship and protect.

The current version must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) limiting its distribution to specially equipped vaccination centers.

But Pfizer’s chief executive Albert Bourla told AFP in an interview that a new version is in the pipeline and that he was optimistic the vaccine will also prove effective against new virus variants.

Bourla said Pfizer has large amounts of real-world data from some of the variant outbreaks.

“We have already data for the UK one — I hate using the countries but people know them like that — which is very prominent in Israel… efficiency was 97 percent” he said.

“We have data from South Africa with the South African variant and overall the efficacy was 100 percent. And also have data from Brazil. And it looks also this is very well controlled.”

Pfizer has not yet compiled sufficient data on the efficiency of its vaccine against the so-called Indian variant the latest to raise concerns that a new wave of infections could overcome the immunization drive.

But he said he was “optimistic” the vaccine would prove effective and that the firm’s mRNA technology can be adapted to counter new strains.

“The thing that makes me feel more comfortable is that we have developed a process that once a variant becomes a variant of concern we should be able to have a new vaccine within 100 days” he said.

“It’s a tough target but I am very comfortable that we should be able to do it.

“And because of the effectiveness of this mRNA technology I believe that variants will not become an issue we’ll be able to control them.”

The European Union is betting big on Pfizer’s relatively expensive vaccine but there are concerns that the difficulty of keeping it at very cold temperatures will make it hard to distribute in poorer countries.

But here again Bourla was confident.

“We are doing actually two things on this front” he said.

The US Food and Drug Administration allows the vaccine to be kept at minus 20 Celsius in a standard freezer for two weeks and Bourla thinks that could be extended.

“And we are about to generate the data for another two weeks. So that this formulation can be stored let’s say a month in minus 20 if we get approval for that” he said.

“On the other hand we are also working with a new formulation which is much improved that will be ready to use: that means you don’t need to dilute the vaccine it will come diluted.”

Pfizer hopes the vaccine will able to be stored for two to three months in normal refrigeration and an additional three months in a freezer Bourla said.

“So a total of four-to-six months outside the minus 50 or 70… we believe we’ll be able to have it if we are successful in summer.”

Leaked price details suggest that the Pfizer vaccine is many times more expensive than for example the competitor product from UK-based AstraZeneca which has failed to meet delivery promises.

But Bourla says the higher cost is justified.

“Our strategy is to try with a pricing [that is] able to provide equitable access to all” he said. Equitable means that more vaccine doses are made available to countries that need it more.

“So we have one tier of pricing which covers all the high-income countries Europe is included in that the US is included in that Japan Canada all the high-income countries” Bourla said.

“I don’t want to go to what is the price for each one country but at the largest it is the cost of a meal. So I would say for the value that the vaccine brings we price that very very reasonably” he said.

For countries defined as middle-income by the World Bank “the price is almost half of what we have in the high-income countries” the CEO said.

“And for the low-income countries we have decided to give it on a non-profit basis of course. So I think this is our strategy this is our policy. So eventually this vaccine will reach all the people of the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53cHhpLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RvcC1zdG9yaWVzL2JldGhlbC1wYXJrLXdvbWFuLXBhcmFseXplZC0xMi1ob3Vycy1hZnRlci1nZXR0aW5nLWZpcnN0LWRvc2UtcGZpemVyLXZhY2NpbmUtZG9jdG9ycy1zZWFyY2hpbmctYW5zd2Vycy9aU1lURVg0SDRGSEtERlZTUEdTM0lMSlpVSS_SAbcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3B4aS5jb20vbmV3cy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy9iZXRoZWwtcGFyay13b21hbi1wYXJhbHl6ZWQtMTItaG91cnMtYWZ0ZXItZ2V0dGluZy1maXJzdC1kb3NlLXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5lLWRvY3RvcnMtc2VhcmNoaW5nLWFuc3dlcnMvWlNZVEVYNEg0RkhLREZWU1BHUzNJTEpaVUkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bethel Park mother left paralyzed after getting first dose of Pfizer vaccine doctors say nervous system played a part,"We’re Sorry!

The team from NHS England & NHS Improvement in Leeds and the University of Manchester says the vaccine proved effective despite the wide circulation of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Although Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has proved effective at preventing severe COVID-19 in clinical trials less evidence has been provided regarding its effectiveness in real-world settings particularly among older people.

Concerns regarding effectiveness have also arisen since the emergence of the highly transmissible and widely circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7.

Now in a study of more than 170000 individuals (aged 80 to 83 years) and matched controls Thomas Mason and colleagues have shown that neutralization of the variant was only slightly reduced following BNT162b2 vaccination.

The vaccine’s efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated to be around 55% after one dose and approximately 70% after a second dose administered 21 days later.

“The nationwide vaccination of older adults in England with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine reduced the burden of COVID-19” writes the team.

A pre-print version of the research paper is available on the medRxiv* server while the article undergoes peer review.

This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication. Since its initial publication the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal. Links to the preliminary and peer-reviewed reports are available in the Sources section at the bottom of this article. View Sources

Assessing efficacy in the real-world setting

Since the COVID-19 outbreak first began in Wuhan China in late December 2019 several vaccines protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection are safe and effective in phase 3 clinical trials with efficacy estimates for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 ranging from 62% to 95%.

However it is also important to assess vaccine efficacy following mass deployment in the real-world setting where trial exclusion criteria do not apply and where people may not adhere to dosing and handling protocols.

Early observational studies conducted in Israel Scotland and England have demonstrated that the real-world efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine is consistent with that reported in clinical trials and is maintained against the more transmissible B.1.1.7. variant.

“However such observational non-randomized studies may be biased by systematic differences between intervention and control groups and between those receiving the intervention at different points in time” writes Mason and colleagues.

Furthermore the unprecedented speed of vaccination rollouts and the specific prioritization of vulnerable groups increases the risk of these biases they add.

“The rapid rollout of the NHS vaccination program in England based on age thresholds offers an opportunity to make unbiased comparisons of outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations” says the team.

Numbers of people in England who received their first COVID-19 vaccination dose between the 8th December 2020 and the 3rd February 2021 by age group. The cumulative totals are relative to estimates of eligible population based on extracts from the National Health Application and Infrastructure Services (NHAIS) system as of the 15th November 2020. Prior to the 4th January 2021 all individuals received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine after which individuals were vaccinated with either the BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector vaccines.

More about the study

The researchers exploited the age-based eligibility phasing in the early stages of the nationwide vaccination rollout in England to estimate the real-world effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccination.

The team matched 170226 vaccine recipients (aged 80 to 83 years) from the community setting outside of care homes with slightly younger (aged 76-79 years) individuals not yet eligible for vaccination on gender area of residence health status living arrangements acute illness and history of seasonal flu vaccination.

“It is particularly important to assess real-world vaccine effectiveness in this older population group because severe COVID-19 is strongly age-associated and adaptive immune responses decline with age” says Mason and the team.

The vaccine recipients received one dose between the 15th and 20th December 2020 and were scheduled to receive a second dose 21 days later.

The rates of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization were compared between the vaccinees and the matched controls over the 45 days following the date that of the first vaccine dose.

Profiles of positive COVID-19 infections and emergency hospital attendances and admissions by days since first dose of vaccination. The data represent people aged between 80 to 83 years who received their first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine between the 15th and 20th December 2020 with comparison to their matched controls. 95% confidence intervals are displayed as dashed lines.

What were the efficacy results?

During the 45-day follow-up period the average incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 13.7 per day per 100000 among the vaccinated individuals and 23.2 per day per 100000 among the unvaccinated controls.

The rates of emergency hospital admissions and infection were 51.0% and 55.2% lower respectively for vaccinated individuals versus matched controls at 21 to 27 days following first vaccination.

The rates of emergency admissions and infections were 75.6% and 70.1% lower 35 to 41 days following first vaccination when 80% of participants had received their second dose.

“Collectively these results are consistent with one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine reducing events from 14 days after vaccination with more effectiveness in reducing the severity of symptoms than preventing infection” says Mason and colleagues. “We provide evidence of high real-world effectiveness of the original dosing schedule of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in preventing infections and hospitalizations despite the widespread transmission of the B.1.1.7 variant shortly after the study population was vaccinated” concludes the team.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

It is also Europe’s only producer of synthetic graphite – a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries – which it has produced since 1969 but now puts the plant in a better position than most to cope with the era of the electric car.

“It seems like a new battery factory is announced every week” says Darren Cunningham the refinery’s long-standing pandemic-hardened manager. “If you’ve got an iPhone it’s got some of our coke in it.”

For decades oil refineries like Humber have quietly kept the UK ticking over processing the fuels needed for everyday life. Oil is being muscled out of the way by greener technologies however and UK refineries along with the rest of the energy industry weakened by the pandemic are fighting for their place in the rapidly shifting energy system.

Owners in the UK ranging from billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe and China’s PetroChina to the Ruia brothers and oil giant Exxon are starting to make calls about how far and how fast they convert operations stick with the status quo or sell off.

Their decisions will affect not only their bank balances but hundreds of thousands of jobs the UK’s energy security and its success at cutting carbon emissions. “Many of the core products of refineries are on a downward trajectory” says EY partner Jon Clark. “It’s probably survival of the most adaptive.”",,,,,,,,,

The FVI released each year since 2017 by Dairy Australia has been expanded in 2021 to include annual rye-grass and Italian rye-grass for the first time in addition to the annual update of the perennial rye-grass FVI.

Pinnacle marketed by AGF Seeds was the star of the annual rye-grass index achieving the top score and a green colour ranking as the cultivar with the most potential to contribute to operating profit in south-west Victoria Gippsland northern Victoria and Tasmania.

Its score of 288 in south-west Victoria was a clear 25 points ahead of its nearest rival.

AGF Seeds product development manager Tim Brown said topping the independent evaluations in each region reflected Pinnacle’s success for farmers.

“The independent information coming out of the trials run by the Pasture Trial Network is of great value for farmers” Mr Brown said.

“Pinnacle’s success reflects its high yield ability and durability that helps farmers to minimise risk and maximise potential growth.

“AGF places great emphasis on durability when looking at varieties and these results confirm that with Pinnacle you get late season quality and production but that doesn’t come at a cost of autumn or winter production.

“We’re seeing good performance with Pinnacle through all seasons and all regions thanks to its durability.”

Pinnacle was bred by French seed company RAGT; it has been extensively evaluated in Australia and is marketed locally by AGF Seeds.

“We saw its potential early in the evaluation and we have continued to trial and develop it” Mr Brown said.

“The results we’re seeing across the regions and the seasons are excellent.

“It’s a very competitive market but Pinnacle continues to grow and get excellent feedback from farmers.”

The FVI rankings are based on yield from independent trials run by the Pasture Trial Network (PTN).

To be included in the FVI database each cultivar must have data from at least three trials conducted using strict industry protocols. Pinnacle was included in seven PTN trials.

The FVI is a tool that helps Australian dairy farmers and their advisers to make more informed decisions when selecting rye-grass cultivars.

It provides an accurate reliable and independent assessment of the potential economic value of rye-grass cultivars in different dairy regions of south-east Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A letter to account holders dated March 12 from PNC Bank indicated that the branch at 240 Main Ave. Hawley will close on June 11 2021.

Operations of the Hawley branch will be combined into the Viewpoint Mall branch located at 100 Viewmont Mall Drive in Dickson City.

PNC Bank’s ATM machine at the Turkey Hill Minit Market located just outside Hawley across from the Wallenpaupack Area High School will still be available.

“At PNC Bank we continuously evaluate our ability to assist you in achieving your financial goals and we strive to provide you with convenient banking options” Travis Branch Retail Market Executive states in the letter.

“Today customers have more service choices than ever before and are using branches very differently. With this in mind we have carefully studied the effectiveness of our branches based on their physical capacity as well as the number of customers who frequent each location.”

The location is scheduled to permanently close at 3 p.m. on Friday June 11.

Marcey Zwiiebel PNC Corporate Communications said that more customers are taking advantage of online transactions. During the first quarter of 2021 ending in March she said 79% of their customers company-wide did their banking online rather than go to a teller. This was up from 71% in the first quarter of 2020. She said there has been a “pretty steady increase” over the last several years.

She said they are happy to help their customers to know how to take advantage of their services online and know what options they have.

American Banker and other media outlets reported in September 2020 that Chairman and CEO William Demchak PNC Financial Services Groups Inc. that PNC planned to close 80 to 90 branches by the end of 2020 and another 120 in 2021. The reason cited was the move by more consumers to adopt online banking which has been accelerated by the impact of the spread of COVID-19.

There are roughly 2200 branches of the Pittsburgh-based company Zwiiebel said. They are primarily in the eastern southeastern and mid-western states.

New branch offices are also planned she said in areas of the country where PNC is expanding.

She said that when a branch is closing typically PNC does their best to place their impacted personnel in other locations.

In 2015 the PNC branch in Newfoundland Wayne County closed and consolidated with the Hawley branch. The Newfoundland branch building is now a lawyer’s office. PNC maintains an ATM in Newfoundland.

Anita J. Baldwin-Cotti commented on Facebook about the old Hawley Bank building “Has it ever been registered as a historical landmark? Please make sure it doesn’t get destroyed!”

""I am impacted by the closing of PNC"" John Troulis of Hawley said. I run a couple businesses and I sometimes need to go inside instead of just running through the Drive Thru.""

PNC Bank has occupied the facility at the corner of Keystone and Main for several years having purchased it from First Eastern Bank; it is thought to have been around 1994-1995.

Hawley Bank opened in 1911 in another location and opened for business in their newly built facility at 240 Main October 5 1929. In 1986 the shareholders of Hawley Bank agreed to merge with First Eastern Bank David Swingle who worked at Hawley Bank recalled.

It is not known what will become of the landmark banking facility.

Another downtown landmark bank the 1st National opened in 1902 diagonally across the street from where Hawley Bank would later build its facility. The former 1st National Bank which also changed ownership by financial institutions a few times is now a restaurant.

The only other bank in downtown Hawley is The Dime Bank Hawley branch.

There are other branch offices for The Dime Bank Wells Fargo Wayne Bank and Honesdale National Bank within about two miles from Hawley Borough along Route 6 between the borough line and the Wallenpaupack Area High School.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvaW5mb3JtYWwtY2FyZWdpdmVycy1lYXJseS1jaGlsZGhvb2Qtb3Bpbmlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Informal caregivers are critical to Colorado's early-childhood care and education system,"It has been a year since the COVID-19 pandemic began and one thing has been increasingly clear both at the national and state level: Our economic recovery largely hinges on access to quality early care and education.

From a business perspective it allows parents to return to work and businesses to reopen properly; from an early learning perspective children get a strong start in life.

Ryan Beiser and Christine Benero

To better understand the extent of the pandemic’s impact on the education of young children on a national scale the PNC Foundation provided funding for a study from the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER). The findings while not surprising were concerning.

The study led by early childhood education public policy expert Steve Barnett found that preschool enrollment rates were down nearly 25% across the nation from pre-pandemic levels with in-person education down even more. There was also a sharp decline in parent at-home support for learning through book reading and other learning activities. Parents also reported unusually high rates of mental health problems for their young children relating to social and emotional development.

In Colorado the early-childhood enrollment rate was down even more during the pandemic at 39% as of summer 2020 according to Early Milestones Colorado.

A safe and nurturing environment for young children to learn and grow isn’t a luxury; it is essential in supporting the workforce of today and tomorrow. Colorado voters business leaders and government agencies recognize this fact as evidenced by robust investments and public policy measures to bring stability to and eventually grow this vital sector.

As we celebrate historic moments like the overwhelming bipartisan support of Proposition EE on last year’s Colorado ballot — raising taxes on nicotine products ultimately to boost preschool funding — as well as recent state and federal public relief funding exceeding $200 million to stabilize and expand the licensed childcare sector we must also acknowledge the importance of informal caregivers.

Also known as Family Friend and Neighbor (FFN) care informal caregivers are often utilized where other care is not affordable not accessible and doesn’t meet the needs of non-traditional work hours. FFN providers are typically grandparents trusted family friends or neighbors.

When you consider over half of Colorado children under age 6 are cared for in an informal setting it is clear FFN care needs to be part of the dialogue on the future of our state’s early childhood system as well as the workforce pipeline.

A recent study conducted by Mile High United Way – in partnership with the Butler Institute for Families at the University of Denver’s Graduate School of Social Work and Early Milestones Colorado – highlighted the stark inequities and financial barriers faced by FFN providers which have been exacerbated during the pandemic.

The study found that:

Overall 58% of FFN providers surveyed indicated their household income has decreased since COVID-19 arrives; this decrease is more acute for Hispanic or Latina providers with 73% reporting a decrease in household income compared to 33% of respondents who identified as white.

35% of respondents received no money for providing care; 58% of respondents received no money or less than $100/week for providing care.

Moreover survey findings showed that few FFN providers have access to the types of basic resources that not only support their caregiving but also their general living needs:

Only 20% of survey respondents have access to help with purchasing food.

Only 19% of survey respondents have access to medical cash or childcare assistance.

Only 13% of survey respondents have access to help paying rent or mortgage.

Now is the time to reimagine opportunities for all caregivers while ensuring all children have access to safe enriching learning environments.

As vaccines become more widely available and we eagerly anticipate returning to a form of normalcy we need to amplify support and focus on the critical area of access to FFN care as part of the childcare and workforce landscape. For the workforce to return to work we need to ensure families have the access and support they need and invest in care for all children.

It is important we acknowledge all caregivers who play a vital role in supporting children’s school readiness and ensuring parents can contribute to our state’s economy. Colorado’s youngest learners need us now more than ever.

So I used the service and the transaction seemed a bit slow but I was warned not to click on the send payment now button more than once or it might trigger a double transfer. Anyway once complete in about 3 minutes the Tesla page stated I had paid in full. However my bank didn't show the funds moved to Tesla until this morning about 24 hours later.



As for inspection- I can still do the inspection and document the needed service and set up an appointment for repair. Here they want you to take delivery and depending on the severity of work they will send a mobile service truck to your home and do the work there. If it requires a lift and garage then they make that decision after you accept ownership of the car. If you refuse the car then you may have to wait for your refund less the transport fee and other costs. Believing you can chisel the price down on a high demand product is not likely to happen by holding up payment. They will probably just put the car in inventory and it will be sold in an hour.

NTT P1 Award winner Colton Herta stayed out front during the morning warm-up for the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg on Sunday leading the final practice with a best lap of 1 minute .6632 of a second in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda.

Herta’s race setup was only three-tenths of a second slower than his pole-winning lap of 1:00.3210 Saturday afternoon.

Cloudy conditions cooled the 14-turn 1.8-mile temporary street circuit this morning but drivers will need to cope with an increase in steamy humidity during the 100-lap race today. Coverage starts at noon (ET) on NBC and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

Reigning Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge winner Takuma Sato could be a driver to watch for a charge through the 24-car field later today. He ended up second in the warm-up at 1:00.6768 in the No. 30 Panasonic/Shield Cleansers Honda. Sato is starting 15th in the race.

Six-time NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Scott Dixon was third-quickest at 1:00.8092 in the No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda followed by rookie Scott McLaughlin at 1:00.8720 in the No. 3 DEX Imaging Team Penske Chevrolet.

Rinus VeeKay rounded out the top five at 1:00.9414 in the No. 21 SONAX/Autogeek Chevrolet.

The ultra-competitive nature of the series showed yet again this weekend on the time sheets. Less than a second separated the top 17 drivers during the warm-up.

Pato O’Ward triggered the only incident of the 30-minute session when he overshot Turn 4 in his No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet and stalled his car trying to return to the circuit.

The Dale Coyne Racing with RWR team may have a bit of extra work to do in the three hours between the end of the warm-up and the start of the race as replays on Peacock Premium showed smoke trailing from the rear of the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda driven by rookie Romain Grosjean.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2plcnNleXN0YWdlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nZXRhcnRpY2xlLnBocD90aXRsZWxpbms9YWxnb25xdWluLWFydHMtdGhlYXRyZS1zdW1tZXItY2FtcHMtZW5yb2xsaW5nLW5vd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Algonquin Arts Theatre Summer Camps Enrolling Now,"originally published: 04/25/2021

She will focus on finding ambitious start-ups across the country and contribute to the firm’s goal of becoming Kiwi's first choice investor among young founder-led companies.

Founded in 2012 by Rick Baker and Niki Scevak in Sydney Blackbird has more than $1 billion under management and a portfolio of over 70 companies including some of the most successful Australian startups such as Canva Culture Amp Mint Innovation Partly SafetyCulture Vow and Zoox.

“I am psyched to be spending the next chapter of my career back home in Aotearoa New Zealand working alongside an ambitious team – right from the beginning of their founder journeys” said Harrop.

“I think the team at Blackbird is unrivalled in its enduring support of founders; willingness to invest early in start-ups; mission to strengthen and diversify the tech ecosystem; and commitment to helping Blackbirds do their best work. I'm stoked to be joining this epic crew.”

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3N0b2NraG91c2UuY29tL25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyNC8wNS8wOC96ZXZvLW9uLWJvZHktcmVwZWxsZW50LXRlYW1zLXVwLXdpdGgtYW1lcmljYW4taGlraW5nLXNvY2lldHktdG8tcHJvdmlkZS10aGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024-05-08 | NYSE:PG | Press Release | Procter & Gamble Co,"Before setting out on adventures at select National Trails Day® 2024 events Zevo will supply hikers with 8 hours of odorless protection against mosquitoes and ticks

Peterson was backed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) former Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams EMILY’s List and activist Gary Chambers Jr. who came in third place in the March primary.

Carter took the first slot with 36 percent in that race followed by Peterson with 23 percent.

He notably embraced support from prominent Louisiana Republicans and may have drawn some GOP voters out because they have no candidate of their own in the runoff. Peterson and her allies hit Carter for courting Republican voters and emphasized her liberal bona fides. She supports the Green New Deal and a $15 minimum wage.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC the independent expenditure arm of EMILY’s List and and the League of Conservation Voters have spent a combined $1.3 million to boost Peterson on the air. But Carter had outraised his opponent as of early April.

A loss by Peterson is a setback for the progressive movement which is readying for a show of force in the 2021 special elections.

New Mexico Democrats selected as their candidate for a June special election state Rep. Melanie Stansbury a slightly more moderate choice than her leading opponent. Now the next best shot for the left to grow its ranks is in an August primary election in Ohio where Nina Turner a former presidential campaign co-chair for Bernie Sanders faces Cuyahoga County Democratic Party leader Shontel Brown.

Still Carter’s arrival in Congress is good news for all House Democrats because it eases concerns over their razor-thin majority.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez praised President Joe Biden and his administration Friday sharing that she's been impressed with Biden's invitations to work and collaborate with progressive lawmakers.

“One thing that I will say is that I do think that the Biden administration and President Biden have exceeded expectations that progressives had” Ocasio-Cortez said during a virtual town hall. “I’ll be frank I think a lot of us expected a lot more conservative administration.”

Ocasio-Cortez a vocal member of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party also said Biden’s willingness to collaborate with more progressive members “really impressed” her and despite areas of disagreements the administration's conduct has been “not just in good faith but active incorporation of progressive legislation” Ocasio-Cortez added.

“Biden announced that he plans to cut emissions by half by 2030” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that two years ago it was almost unthinkable to think that Joe Biden would be making an announcement like that.”

Rep. Jamaal Bowman D-N.Y. echoed similar sentiments. Bowmen told Newsweek he feels the White House and Biden “are more progressive than they’ve ever been in this moment” citing the leadership of Sen. Bernie Sanders I-V.t. Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive House members for the shift.

Despite her praise of the nearly 100-day-old Biden administration the New York congresswoman also said that it’s still too early to determine whether future Biden’s policies will receive progressive support.

“I think it’s been good so far but I still think it’s quite early because when it comes to some of things that have been passed it’s pretty much been the COVID bill” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We’re in the process of shaping the infrastructure bill but I think the infrastructure bill will be a key indicator if the administration is keeping or raising its ambitions or if that (American Rescue Plan) was a one and done situation and we’re going smaller.”

While the passing of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill despite no Republican support was a major feat for Biden providing millions of Americans with $1400 stimulus checks funding for vaccine distribution and the reopening of schools and colleges many progressives weren’t thrilled with the final version of the bill including the lack of a $15 minimum wage.

Ocasio-Cortez said she had some concerns especially regarding Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill.

“My concern is that with the actual plan that they’ve presented it doesn’t have the numbers necessary to actually do that they say they want to do” Ocasio-Cortez told constituents. “So that’s why we have been on the side of trying to pressure the administration to be a little bit more ambitious.”

Biden’s infrastructure plan — the American Jobs Plan — is divided into four main categories: Transportation infrastructure; quality of life at home; help for caregivers; and research development and manufacturing. In addition to investing in roads railways homes schools and underground water infrastructure the bill also would focus on improving access to affordable care for the elderly and people with disabilities.

While Ocasio-Cortez said she thinks that Biden’s current bill is too small she does think his “vision was right.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL2xhdGVzdC9wcmlzb25zLXVuZGVyY3V0LXRoZWlyLW1pc3Npb24tbW9vcmUtMjEwNDI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Restricting Outside Contact Prisons Undercut Their Mission to Rehabilitate,"“To improve public safety by positively changing lives.” That’s the motto of the Washington State Department of Corrections. Of course the realities faced by prisoners inside of Washington’s carceral facilities—as well as in most other states—are far from the PR-friendly reform-focused tenor of this mission statement.

Mass incarceration is particularly problematic in Washington state where the rate is 480 for every 100000 residents a number nearly triple that of the United Kingdom.

Of every 100000 people in the United States around 700 of them are serving time. Although the country makes up just 5 percent of the world’s population it accounts for 25 percent of the world’s incarcerated. And of those released from U.S. prisons 68 percent are arrested for a new crime within three years of their release.

Mass incarceration is particularly problematic in Washington state where the rate is 480 for every 100000 residents a number nearly triple that of the United Kingdom which is the second highest of the twelve founding NATO countries. According to the Washington Department of Corrections of the 7865 people released from their prisons in 2009 2190—or about 28 percent—of them were re-incarcerated within three years.

As someone who’s spent the better part of my life contributing to statistics such as these and a current ward of the Washington DOC my story sheds some light on the mystery of why and how the department has failed so miserably to accomplish its mission to “positively change lives.”

The answer is simple yet sinister: Isolation discourages reform.

Six and a half years ago I sat in Downtown Seattle’s King County Jail facing a thirty-five-year sentence for a string of armed robberies that spanned three jurisdictions. I was twenty-nine years old and though it had been five years since I’d seen the inside of a prison cell that had been the longest stretch of freedom I’d experienced in nearly two decades.

My friends and family were devastated to be losing me but they promised to stick around no matter what the outcome of my case. As it turns out most of them didn’t understand the scope of such a commitment.

Companies like Globo Tel Link (GTL) and Securus provide phone services in prisons through contracts negotiated by DOC administrators. GTL charges Washington prisoners—or much more often their loved ones—ten cents-per-minute for local calls and extraneous fees to set up prepaid accounts. Calls are limited to twenty minutes and with tax they usually come to around $2 and fifty cents apiece.

Understandably many incarcerated people with spouses and children call home periodically throughout the day in order to keep in touch. Assuming an incarcerated mother or father spends one hour a day communicating with his or her family it would require three calls adding up to $7.50 every day—and ultimately $225 a month including transaction fees.

This is more than quadruple what most people in the free world pay monthly on their cell phone bills.

JPay and similar corporations have found unique ways of capitalizing off mass incarceration by charging for services such as emails which are free to most of the rest of the world.

JPay and similar corporations have found unique ways of capitalizing off mass incarceration by charging for services such as emails which are free to most of the rest of the world. Prices vary from state to state but in Washington messages of no more than 1000 characters can be sent for about thirty cents apiece—unless an individual purchases them in bulk in which case they become slightly cheaper.

Incoming and outgoing emails are reviewed by mailroom prison staff and are often blocked for reasons such as “Writing for third party publication” or “Writing a book without permission from the prison” both of which are clear violations of the First Amendment. Even a simple screenshot of a Wikipedia page about cats for examplewill likely be rejected for no apparent reason.

JPay also sells bulky outdated and often malfunctioning tablets with limited capabilities. It sells MP3s and movies at rates of about $8 for a new release movie rental much higher than those of free-world music vendors and streaming services.

With no competitors for prisoners to choose from GTL and JPay have effectively monopolized Washington State’s incarcerated community. They can as a result offer inferior services for more money and still retain their contracts with prison administrators. The DOC has the discretion to choose among different vendors—and assist in setting prices—based on how much of a kickback it receives.

Meanwhile those paying for these services—folks who are incarcerated and their loved ones—are only given one option—to pay exorbitant fees. For the DOC communication between the incarcerated and their loved ones through vendors that provide kickbacks is a profitable potentially million dollar racket raking in approximately fifty cents per inbound money transfer five cents per outbound email $5 per MP3 device $10 per JP5 tablet device and 5 percent of JPay’s music download fees. Access to other modes of communication like cell phones and the Internet is restricted and visiting conditions seem tailored to keep friends and family from wanting to come back.

In most prisons visits take place on weekends and are heavily policed. Tables are set close together prohibiting any semblance of privacy One brief embrace along with a short kiss is allowed at the beginning and end of each session. Between these times it’s permitted to touch hands and forearms but never above a shoulder. If a visitor should happen to lovingly brush her husband’s face with the back of her hand she may find herself surrounded by hefty uniformed guards scowling reprimanding and threatening her.

This can be a very traumatic experience for those who come to visit prisoners and it often discourages them from visiting again. (While visits are currently suspended due to COVID-19 they will soon be one-hour once each month and direct contact will be forbidden in any form.)

I received a twelve-year sentence of which I’ll have served eight-and-a-half years by the time I’m released in 2023. Most of those who claimed they would stick around for me disappeared within the first year. Four years ago I was fortunate to meet my amazing wife who supports my dreams and was willing to navigate a system that seemed rigged against my successful re-entry.

Without my wife and the editors who have supported me I would soon be facing release into a world with which I had little-to-no connection.

Most prisoners hope for little more from their spouses than money food packages and funds they can spend with vendors like JPay. I wanted to never again return to prison so my wife has bridged the gap between me and society by submitting my writing to various publishers magazines journals and newspapers. We emailed my work out and discussed submissions formatting and editing over the phone creating a financially viable model despite the excessive cost of communication. Within two years I had built a resume that free-world authors would be proud of.

Without my wife and the editors who have supported me I would soon be facing release into a world with which I had little-to-no connection in a social climate I would have forgotten how to navigate. Instead I now have a career that will provide me with a future and a loving supportive partner waiting to help me reintegrate back into society.

Outside support is the only common factor that I’ve seen among those who have gotten out and not come back. And that is one sign of how badly the Washington DOC like most other prison systems is failing in its mission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3dhci1hbmQtcGVhY2UvZGl0Y2gtdGhlLWRyYWZ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Let's Just Ditch the Draft,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/war-and-peace/ditch-the-draft on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3dhci1hbmQtcGVhY2UvZGl0Y2gtdGhlLWRyYWZ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC9hdXN0cmFsaWEtcXVlZW5zbGFuZC1ncmVlbnMtYWxwLWxlZnQtcG9wdWxpc20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Progressive Populism Has Transformed Australia Before — It Could Do It Again,"In 2012 twenty-one past winners of the Blue Planet Prize — awarded for research that improves the global environment — released a landmark report. It stated that “in the face of an absolutely unprecedented emergency society has no choice but to take dramatic action to avert a collapse of civilization.” A year later the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research Kevin Anderson went one step further arguing that “revolutionary change to the political and economic hegemony” would be needed to prevent the planet warming by more than 2°C. More recently in 2019 scientists from fifty nations demanded “bold and drastic” changes to the economy including a shift away from GDP growth toward “sustaining ecosystems and improving human well-being.” This year a paper coauthored by seventeen scientists called for “fundamental changes to global capitalism education and equality which include inter alia the abolition of perpetual economic growth.” The need for radical change couldn’t be clearer. But devising a strategy to achieve such change isn’t so straightforward. The need for radical change couldn’t be clearer. But devising a strategy to achieve such change isn’t so straightforward. To shed light on the question it’s worth revisiting two examples of progressive populism from Australia’s history — the 1940 and 1972 electoral campaigns led by Labor’s John Curtin and Gough Whitlam respectively.

Defining Progressive Populism In her 2019 essay “The Old is Dying and the New Cannot Be Born” Nancy Fraser outlines a useful definition of progressive populism. For Fraser the key is combining an “inclusive politics of recognition” guaranteeing respect and esteem for marginalized social groups with a “pro-working family politics of distribution” that pushes toward economic redistribution and emphasizes social class. To provide a more concrete illustration of what this means Fraser points to the two Democratic primary campaigns of Bernie Sanders. In her view he achieved this mix between recognition and redistribution by fighting for “criminal justice reform plus Medicare for all reproductive justice plus free college tuition; LGBTQ+ rights plus breaking up the big banks.” For Fraser progressive populism requires a significant role for “revived and reimagined labor unions — as well as for political parties and social movements.” Ideally it’s a strategy that can constitute the working class as a political force allowing it to become “the leading force in an alliance that also includes substantial segments of youth the middle class and the professional-managerial stratum.” As Fraser argues: Only by joining a robustly egalitarian politics of distribution to a substantively inclusive class-sensitive politics of recognition can we build a counterhegemonic bloc capable of leading us beyond the current crisis to a better world.

Progressive Populism in Australia There are two strong precedents for such left populism in Australia’s history. Two of the nation’s most transformative Labor prime ministers John Curtin and Gough Whitlam succeeded by building a political program combining recognition and redistribution. Two of Australia’s most transformative Labor prime ministers John Curtin and Gough Whitlam succeeded by building a political program combining recognition and redistribution. Writing in Thesis Eleven back in 1983 Professor Rob Watts argued that John Curtin’s wartime leadership first in opposition and then as prime minister from October 1941 to his death in July 1945 was characterized by a “democratic populism which underpinned nearly six years of equality and sacrifice rhetoric.” While criticizing simplistic narratives that overstate Curtin’s reform agenda Watts acknowledges the effectiveness of his democratic populist strategy: “It was well-intentioned it was persuasive and it activated great policies and brought Curtin unimagined fame as a wartime leader.” For example in an election policy speech in August 1940 Curtin insisted that “economic freedom must be made real by giving security and a rising standard of living to all.” Curtin remained committed to economic security once in office making full employment and the establishment of the welfare state two of the major priorities of his government. Curtin and his party blended these redistributive elements with a politics of recognition manifested in initiatives such as the Women’s Employment Board which increased wages for some women during the war. Other reforms extended maternity allowances increased welfare benefits for Aboriginal Australians and extended pension eligibility for some populations of migrant workers. By appealing to all Australians through a material politics of redistribution as well as an extension of recognition to previously excluded social groups Curtin led Labor to its greatest ever victory at the 1943 election. The ALP won 58.2 percent of the two-party preferred vote and two-thirds of seats in the House of Representatives with a 17-seat swing. Gough Whitlam’s 1972 “It’s Time” electoral campaign also had a progressive populist focus on fairer economic distribution and recognition that backed by social movements swept away twenty-three years of conservative rule. In his election speech Whitlam set out three programmatic aims: “to promote equality to involve the Australian people in the decision-making processes of our land and to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons of the Australian people.” Whitlam opposed the “we” of the people to the corruption of the establishment saying “we ought to be angry at the way our so-called leaders have kept us in the dark — parliament itself as much as the people to hide their own incapacity and ignorance.” Whitlam concluded with an optimistic populist appeal: I need the help of the Australian people; and given that I do not for a moment believe that we should set limits on what we can achieve together for our country our people our future. It wasn’t hollow rhetoric either. There was a genuinely egalitarian politics of distribution to Whitlam’s program centered around “cities schools and hospitals.” He followed through with a blizzard of reforms that led to real material gains for workers. The 1973 budget doubled spending on housing tripled investments in urban development and quadrupled spending on education. Whitlam’s 1973 budget doubled spending on housing tripled investments in urban development and quadrupled spending on education. The Whitlam government passed a stunning 508 bills in just over a thousand days in office. These included acts providing for universal health care free tertiary education national standards of equal pay and four weeks’ annual leave. He significantly increased spending on social security benefits and pensions as well as on regional employment and services. Just as with Curtin recognition also formed part of Whitlam’s reform agenda. His government passed the Racial Discrimination Act took steps toward granting Aboriginal people land rights and introduced a single mothers’ benefit and no-fault divorce while championing the decriminalization of homosexuality. Though Whitlam was not much of a protester himself it’s unsurprising that his rise to office came off the back of burgeoning movements: women’s and gay liberation Aboriginal land rights environmental and antiwar as well as surging trade unions. Union density and strike rates experienced historic highs in the 1960s and early ’70s with the strike rate peaking in 1974. These movements were crucial to Whitlam’s success and to ensuring that he delivered change once in office.

A Progressive Populist Revival? There are also important signs of a revival in progressive populism in Australia — only today it is playing out within the Greens particularly in Queensland (QLD). In recent years the QLD Greens have successfully combined populist positioning a platform offering material gains for ordinary people and movement building. At the 2019 election local campaigns in the seats of Griffith Brisbane and Ryan achieved significant swings even though the Greens vote was stagnating at a national level. The Queensland Greens have successfully combined populist positioning a platform offering material gains for ordinary people and movement building. This success rested on a platform that emphasized free childcare more public housing publicly owned renewable energy and free dental care (CHED for short). At the March 2020 Brisbane City Council election Greens councilor Jonathan Sri’s core campaign messages emphasized “standing up against political corruption” and “giving residents more control over council decision-making.” He was reelected with a 12.4 percent primary vote swing. State strategist for the QLD Greens Max Chandler-Mather and South Brisbane campaign manager Liam Flenady explained that a strong ground campaign was crucial to their 2019 success. At the October 2020 state election it paid off again with the QLD Greens recording substantial swings in Cooper Greenslopes and McConnel. The campaign returned Greens MP Michael Berkman with a 14 percent swing in Maiwar while Amy MacMahon won the seat of South Brisbane away from Labor’s Jackie Trad. Chandler-Mather recently preselected as the Greens’ federal candidate for Griffith has said the party will continue using this strategy: “Politics is about reaching out to people about the issues that affect their daily lives and what they care about and making policies that address those issues.” When Victorian left-winger Adam Bandt took over the federal leadership of the Greens in February 2020 the whole party began to shift toward a left populist strategy. In October 2020 Bandt reflected on Greens successes in New Zealand and the ACT: The Greens are on the rise because we put people ahead of big corporations. We’re pushing back against the establishment parties’ failed trickle-down economic policies and tax cuts for millionaires. We are fighting for direct investment in public schools hospitals public housing and public services to create jobs and a better life for everyone. This year Bandt’s February speech to the Greens national conference focused on inequality stressing that ordinary people had suffered while “billionaires and big corporations are making out like bandits.” While the Greens have always been strong on the politics of recognition their recent left populist turn suggests a greater emphasis on redistribution and movement building.

Private equity firms are buying up insurers — and the policies they hold — at a feverish pace. Some groups namely financial advisors fear the trend may be bad for consumers who own annuity and life insurance contracts. Critics are concerned the buyers will wring profits from customers — via higher costs — to boost returns for their investors. Consumers may have owned such insurance for years and depend on a certain price for their financial plans. They may have bought a policy based on an insurer's financial strength or credit rating. New buyers may not have the same rating which signifies its ability to pay future benefits advisors cautioned. More from Personal Finance:

How the Biden capital gains tax proposal would hit the wealthy

As home prices rise here's what buyers can do to land a deal ""There's nothing good in this for the policyholder"" Larry Rybka chairman and CEO of Akron Ohio-based Valmark Financial Group said of the private equity trend. But others don't see a five-alarm-fire scenario. Many of the bigger buyers are well-capitalized firms and not all deals are inherently bad according to some analysts. Policyholders may benefit from potentially higher investment returns in an environment of low interest rates. ""I don't know if I'd say [they're] unfounded"" Dafina Dunmore lead analyst for alternative investment managers at Fitch Ratings said of the fears. ""I'd say they're overplayed.""

The pace of acquisitions has accelerated since 2014 according to Refinitiv which tracks financial data. There were 191 private-equity-backed insurance deals last year in the U.S. beating the prior record of 154 set in 2019. Buyers paid $12.1 billion so far in 2021 for the deals — eclipsing the $9.7 billion record set in full-year 2018 according to Refinitiv. ""By definition [private equity's] mandate is not the policyholders"" said Gregory Olsen a certified financial planner and partner at Lenox Advisors. ""It's to make as much money for their investors [as possible]."" Annuity and life insurance policies carry various annual fees for consumers. Those fees can be raised up to a certain cap guaranteed by the contract.

Advisors are concerned private equity buyers will raise those various fees to their maximum values. The result may be eroded investment earnings in a variable annuity or higher annual premiums required to keep a life insurance policy for example. ""I'd watch closely on the expenses"" Olsen said. Worried or adversely affected consumers may be able to exchange their annuity or life insurance for another. However such transfers are complicated advisors said. Consumers may inadvertently trigger penalties and fees or may be better suited staying in their current contract even with higher annual fees they said.

Types of deals

Acquisitions are often complicated and can take different structures which have different implications for consumers. For example a buyer may purchase a majority stake in an insurer or buy it outright. In February KKR bought a 60% stake in insurer Global Atlantic for more than $4 billion. More than 2 million people have fixed annuities life insurance other policies with Global Atlantic. In January Blackstone agreed to buy Allstate Life Insurance Company for $2.8 billion. The life insurer represents 80% — or $23 billion — of Allstate Corporation's life insurance and annuity assets. (Allstate is trying to sell the other $5 billion currently held by Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York it said in the deal announcement.)

In these types of deals private-equity firms may have an incentive to avoid raising costs and risking reputational damage that may cost them future business. Global Atlantic for example hasn't changed policyholder fees on any existing policies since the ownership change according to a KKR spokesperson. ""As owner KKR has a vested interest in the long-term success of Global Atlantic which can only be achieved through strong trusted relationships with policyholders and their financial advisors and by continuing to offer competitive products"" according to an e-mailed statement. Other recent deals have involved legacy business lines closed to new customers. These types of transactions may be a bit shakier since that same incentive doesn't exist advisors said. Sixth Street Partners announced a deal to buy Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company which owns a large block of legacy insurance business in January. Talcott manages over $90 billion for roughly 900000 customers including nearly 600000 annuity contract holders.

The P/E angle is really to gather assets that are 'sticky.' David Havens global insurance analyst at Imperial Capital

The current Talcott owners are a group of private-equity firms that had bought Hartford Financial Services Group's annuity business consisting largely of legacy variable annuity contracts in 2018. Similarly in 2018 Voya Financial divested more than $50 billion of legacy fixed and variable annuities to Apollo Global Management Crestview Partners and Reverence Capital Partners. The buyers rebranded the segment as Venerable Insurance. Allison Proud a spokeswoman for Venerable declined to comment. Allison Lang a spokeswoman for Talcott also declined comment.

This has resulted in potentially significant accounting changes for entities that have entered into cloud-computing arrangements.

The IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC®) has published two agenda decisions clarifying how arrangements in respect of a specific part of cloud technology Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) should be accounted for. The agenda decisions do not address the accounting for other components of cloud technology such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service

The first agenda decision published in March 2019 concludes that SaaS arrangements are likely to be service arrangements rather than intangible or leased assets. This is because the customer typically only has a right to receive future access to the supplier’s software running on the supplier’s cloud infrastructure and therefore the supplier controls the intellectual property (IP) of the underlying software code

The second agenda decision published in April 2021 deals with specific circumstances in relation to configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing SaaS:

In limited circumstances certain configuration and customisation activities undertaken in implementing SaaS arrangements may give rise to a separate asset where the customer controls the IP of the underlying software code. For example the development of bridging modules to existing on-premise systems or bespoke additional software capability

In all other instances configuration and customisation costs will be an operating expense. They are generally recognised in profit or loss as the customisation and configuration services are performed or in certain circumstances over the SaaS contract term when access to the cloud application software is provided

This conclusion could result in a reduction in profit in a particular year impacting measures such as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and profit before tax (PBT)

Where a change in accounting policy is required comparative financial information should be retrospectively restated to derecognise previously capitalised costs where material in accordance with NZ IAS 8 Accounting Policies Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

There may be several consequential impacts beyond the immediate accounting implications arising from the IFRIC agenda decisions that should be considered e.g. the impact on business metrics and targets linked to profit measures.

Although specific to for-profit entities public benefit entities (PBEs) should also consider the implications of the agenda decisions for their SaaS arrangements. The first agenda decision as to whether the arrangement meets the definition of an intangible or a service is directly relevant since PBE IPSAS 31 Intangible Assets is based on NZ IAS 38 Intangible Assets and has consistent definitions. The second agenda decision is also relevant in determining whether there is an asset or an expense for configuration and customisation costs and when to recognise the expense (when the service is delivered).

The person with whom you’re writing can’t see your face or hear your voice so you have to make sure your comments leave no room for misunderstanding. You never know how your verbiage might be interpreted. Pay careful attention to tone and be professional!

For example in response to customer inquiries never reply casually with a one-word answer like “Sure” or “Yeah.” Instead take the time to write “Of course that’s no problem” or “Yes thank you.” It’s imperative that your words strike the correct tenor.

The best way to improve in this regard is to practice out-of-context reading. Read your response aloud and see how it makes you feel. If you’re confused or overwhelmed by the information try breaking the text into smaller paragraphs or bullet points.

We need to be mindful of the impact our words have on others. Being professional polite informative and pleasant should be your goal. You want to come across as a compassionate human not a machine. Try not to be too firm long-winded or standoffish. Keep your words simple straightforward and friendly. Always practice kindness in your writing especially if what’s being conveyed might be difficult or unpleasant for the recipient to “hear.”

I know writing isn’t easy for everyone but don’t worry. There’s software out there that can help. Some of it is robust and can do much more than just check your spelling; it can also test for tone grammar and punctuation. These digital tools can save you time and trouble. Don’t be afraid to get assistance even if it’s from a robot!

Connect Through Voice

Speaking of robots how does your self-storage operation’s voicemail message sound? Make sure it’s current. Include your location hours of operation and any other critical information callers might need. Keep it short clear professional and friendly.

Likewise when talking on the phone be sure to smile. You might feel silly at first but the person on the other end can hear it in your voice. If you’re more of a face-to-face person imagine there’s someone in front of you. One tip is to place a doll or other toy on your desk and talk to it as though it’s the person on the other end of the line. Visualization can also help ensure your tone of voice is correct.

Just because we can’t always meet our customers in person doesn’t mean we have to be monotone drones. Treat your prospects and tenants with the same appreciation and warmth over the phone as you would if they were standing in your office.

Connect Through Visuals

While you might not see or even speak to your tenants all that often these days your facility communicates nonverbal messages to them all the time. Show them respect and gratitude by ensuring your facility is clean organized and welcoming. Halls and drives should be well-maintained and weather-ready. Abolish any weeds debris leaves and trash. An attractive site makes a pleasant greeting when you can’t. Let your site speak for you.

Here are some other ways to visually communicate with customers:

Decorate your facility for the holidays or upcoming sporting events.

Celebrate healthcare workers with signage or post encouraging quotes on your marquee.

Update your banners and flags to keep the property bright and fresh.

Any improvement can make your exterior more approachable eye-catching and appealing. A welcoming facility can complement the tone and tenor of your written and verbal communication. You can actually exceed customer expectations with aesthetics as they contribute to and reinforce your commitment to service.

Make the Connection

In a time when you may not be having many face-to-face interactions with customers written verbal and visual communication are critical. They’re always important but never more so than in a digital contactless environment. Pay attention to how your business is being perceived across all platforms from emails and chats to phone conversations to signage and facility appearance.

During these trying times we need to remember that we’re all human and we all have human needs. Connection is essential. The way to maintain it in a contactless self-storage environment is to focus on communication of all kinds. It takes a bit more effort but you can still focus on putting the customer first even in our technological germ-filled world.

Second in an occasional series

The man’s voice is hoarse in the early hours of a cold January morning.

“Shoot me in the f------ head! Please. Shoot me!”

Steam escapes from his mouth each time he beckons an Ida County deputy sheriff to kill him. There is blood on his arms and legs as he paces the pavement in Ida Grove wearing only yellow underwear and one sock.

“Please. … Please! … PLEASE!”

Shivering he screams about his mom and that she killed herself and that someone is trying to take the family farm.

“The government doesn’t give a s---!”

The deputy with his stun gun pointed at the man — who court records later revealed suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder — is able to calm and cuff him in about five minutes.

That scene was from a Jan. 1 2020 police body camera video provided by the Ida County Sheriff’s Office after a public records request for the In Focus project. Iowa newspapers involved in the project are examining how police video is recorded in Iowa and whether the public has adequate access to it.

The Ida County video depicts a man embroiled in personal crisis and none of it was edited or obscured. However some law enforcement agencies have refused to release videos they say violate the privacy of the people shown especially if the agencies lack the ability to redact or obscure images from the videos.

“I guess they’ve moved on now to their next set of excuses which is: ‘Because we have to redact this we can’t give it to you'” said David O’Brien a Cedar Rapids lawyer who has used police body camera videos for wrongful-death lawsuits that set important legal precedents for their public release.

RELATED OPINION:Accountability for police videos must not be shrugged off

After Drew Edwards 22 of Maquoketa died in June 2019 after being struck with a stun gun by police Maquoketa police would not release the officer’s body camera video saying it would be a violation of Edwards’ privacy rights — even though Edwards’ family wanted the video to be made public. That recording eventually was released in connection with a federal wrongful-death lawsuit the police department settled last fall.

City of Chicago attorneys tried to block the release of a video of Chicago Police Department officers breaking into the wrong house in February 2019 and erroneously arresting a social worker who had just gotten home from work and was undressing. The video of the naked woman being handcuffed was made public only when the woman sued the city.

Public interest in police video is high after officer-involved shootings in locations across the county including Iowa. A new citizens’ review board being formed in Cedar Rapids after the Black Lives Matter protests for instance will have access to police reports and evidence including body camera footage to review citizen complaints. That’s in keeping with the idea behind having officers wear body cameras in the first place: to monitor the use of the special authority the public gives police officers in enforcing the law.

But balancing that accountability with privacy also is important.

After some websites have posted police mug shots for online entertainment law enforcement agencies may be worried body camera video could too easily end up on a website with no motive beyond profit.

“What if you are responding to a traumatized rape victim/survivor who does not want to be recorded?” University of Iowa Police Officer Alton Poole asked. “What if you are responding to someone in the privacy of their own home who does not want their medical condition revealed to the public?”

Video requests

The In Focus project is in the process of evaluating the responses of more than 100 law enforcement agencies across Iowa to requests for video from body-worn police cameras or in-car dashboard cameras.

While the vast majority of agencies so far have complied with the routine requests others cited privacy concerns for withholding parts or all of the recordings. Many rural agencies said they don’t have the ability to redact sensitive information and some said they were therefore unable to provide the recordings at all.

“I don’t think that gives them a right to keep from providing the whole video” O’Brien said. “They just have to pixelate some of that out.”

The Iowa Attorney General has said records custodians should redact or “black out” confidential information and then provide public access to the rest of the record.

The police videos are produced by cameras purchased with public money at a considerable expense. The Des Moines Police Department for example spent about $1.6 million on body-worn cameras in 2017. Part of that money came from donations and federal grants.

The videos can be important evidence in criminal cases but departments often cite increased accountability for officers when they seek to purchase the cameras.

“That’s what these are about is transparency” Sioux City Police Chief Rex Mueller said at a news conference last year after the city decided to spend more than $260000 on body-worn cameras.

Despite a growing consensus bolstered by court rulings that the public has a right to view the video recordings there still are police chiefs and sheriffs who claim to have unilateral authority over whether they should be released.

“We will not send info unless you are related to a criminal issue” Rockwell City Police Chief Mike Anderson said in response to one of the In Focus records requests.

On the other hand the Fayette Police Department which has four officers in far northeast Iowa hasn’t gotten many media requests for video but didn’t have a problem copying the first police video of 2020 on a thumb drive and mailing it to a reporter.

“I pride myself on transparency as I always try to ensure we accommodate where I can within the realm of safety and investigation integrity” Chief Ben Davis said.

The department also recently purchased pistol-mounted cameras that record when a gun is drawn “to ensure we have more than enough evidence for any incident that may come up” Davis said.

Technical difficulties

Despite significant advances in law enforcement video technology many agencies haven’t developed a system for distributing videos to the public especially when they have privacy concerns. Some who were keen to provide the videos but unable to redact sensitive information got creative.

In Audubon County which has about 5600 residents in western Iowa the sheriff’s office offered an in-person view of the video while someone fast-forwarded past the private information.

“I realize that is not an ideal solution but unfortunately I don’t see any other viable alternatives” said Chris Swensen the Audubon County attorney. That’s because Swensen was reluctant to provide video recordings of a traffic incident in which someone in an audio portion of the recording provided a driver’s license number and home address.

The sheriff’s office recently bought new body cameras and dash cameras for its seven patrol vehicles for more than $40000. But in an effort to save money the county didn’t purchase the technology that automatically downloads the videos and provides the software to edit them.

Just last month the Cedar Rapids Police Department purchased a license to use Panasonic IDguard redaction software to edit video produced by body cameras or in-car cameras spokesman Greg Buelow said. The agency of 213 sworn officers has been using body cameras since 2017.

The new software costs $2400 a year.

“There are a number of factors that affect how long it takes to edit video including number of cameras number of subjects in a scene amount of movement length of the video footage and positive identification of subjects” he wrote in an email. “For example we are prohibited from the disclosure of the identity of a juvenile if they are not being charged with a forcible felony so the video would involve obscuring the identity (visual and sound) of the juvenile.”

Despite having this technology and being ready to use it the Cedar Rapids department so far hasn’t had any requests for video that have needed redactions Buelow said.

Video redaction doesn’t have to be costly.

FastRedaction.com offers a free trial of its artificial intelligence program that blurs faces when video is uploaded reducing the time spent on redactions by 90 percent according to its website. That site used by law enforcement agencies offers a pay-as-you-go format for $19 plus $1 per minute of recorded video. This means a 10-minute video would cost $29. Adobe Premiere Pro a common but capable video-editing software can be licensed for $21 a month.

What should be private?

The man in western Iowa's Ida Grove who repeatedly pleaded for the deputy to shoot and kill him eventually relented and was apprehended.

His arrest documented in a video recording provided by the Ida County Sheriff’s Office was not digitally obscured before it was disseminated illustrating lack of guidance in state law about how law enforcement agencies should handle privacy concerns.

Several departments declined to release videos because they contained personally-identifiable or medical information or because they depicted juveniles or domestic situations inside a private residence.

The city of Clinton said it needed to redact video that showed the inside of a patrol vehicle because someone could use it to learn more about police equipment to hack it. The video Clinton later provided at a cost of $210 was heavily pixelated in parts to conceal a police officer’s computer a driver’s license vehicle registrations and the faces of the driver and a passenger in a traffic stop on a public road in clear view of anyone passing by.

The redactions however were somewhat haphazard: The driver’s face and the officer’s computer screen are clearly visible at times.

But videos that other agencies provided showed driver’s licenses children who were placed in temporary custody because their father was arrested the full interior of a home that was being searched for drugs and frequently the insides of patrol vehicles.

The Greene County Sheriff’s Office provided a completely unredacted video of a drug search in Grand Junction west of Ames. It is nearly two hours long and shows several people who live there including a man in a silk bathrobe.

Greene County Sheriff Jack Williams said he had qualms about providing an unredacted video of the inside of someone’s home “but I just went with what the county attorney said to do.”

Does Iowa's open records law need changes?

Iowa’s open records law Chapter 22 of the Iowa Code has 73 exceptions to openness. A handful of exceptions protect personal information such as student or patient records Social Security numbers home phone numbers of state employees and addresses of people applying for housing assistance.

But the law doesn’t allow police to keep secret video just because it may be embarrassing to the person in the video.

The Illinois Freedom of Information Act allows government agencies to redact personal information “that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy” unless the person consents. The law goes on to say this includes “information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject’s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest. …”

The Illinois law does not allow agencies to conceal information “that bears on the public duties of public employees” so any video of an officer-involved shooting or other police actions may not be protected by this provision.

Iowa has no law governing how body cameras should be used. A 2017 bill declared police video a public record required agencies to keep the video for at least 30 days and asked officers to give people who aren’t being investigated for criminal acts the option of having the camera turned off among other provisions. That bill failed to gain approval.

American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis argued in a September position paper Iowa’s outdated laws cause confusion and abuse.

“In order to be an effective oversight tool adoption of body cameras must be accompanied by strong clear policies to govern their use data retention and sharing” Bettis said. “Thoughtful legislation is needed to balance accountability transparency and privacy.”

The ACLU which advocates for personal privacy and police accountability has said it’s appropriate to obscure or redact footage of people inadvertently shown on camera or people in their own homes who aren’t part of a police investigation.

However “once someone is part of a public investigation arrest or stop that becomes a public record” Policy Director Pete McRoberts said earlier this year.

How this story was reported

This article is the second in the series called InFocus that examines the use of police body cameras and access to police video in Iowa.

The Iowa Newspaper Association and more than 50 Iowa newspaper reporters attempted to contact more than 300 Iowa law enforcement agencies starting in early November to request copies of their policies on body cameras and in-car dashboard cameras.

These initial contacts were made mostly through email and cited Iowa Code Chapter 22 the open records law.

More than 200 agencies provided policies in the first round. As for remaining agencies some do not use body cameras some have outsourced law enforcement to neighboring agencies and others were branches of a larger agency such as the Iowa Department of Public Safety which has one policy for all units.

In the second installment reporters requested body camera video from the first incident in 2020 and this installment was produced after reviewing about 100 responses from across the state.

GILMER COUNTY Ga. — Law enforcement agencies have identified four suspects and are working to learn the name of a fifth after the body of a missing woman was found during a welfare check.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported that the Gilmer County Sheriff's Office had discovered the body of 37-year-old Rossana Delgado of Bethlehem Georgia on April 20 around 7 a.m. while checking a home in Cherry Log.

Delgado had been reported missing in Barrow County on April 16 and had last been seen in DeKalb County on that day.

Loved ones who had not been notified of the discovery as of Friday spoke with 11Alive about her disappearance and concerning discoveries that led them to believe there was foul play involved.

Her close friends said Delgado spoke to her husband around 7 p.m. last Friday night right before picking up a person for her job. That was the last time he spoke with her. He reported her missing about eight hours later.

Surveillance video shows the last moments she was seen at a Ross store in the Chamblee mall called Plaza Fiesta next to another woman.

Friends and family don't know who she is but they said Delgado's husband was able to trace his wife's last moves through her phone. He was able to track the phone to a home in DeKalb County and said the signal was there for roughly one hour before heading to a public storage unit on Covington Highway. There Delgado's husband found a face ask with blood on it.

A day after those close to the mother of two spoke with 11Alive the GBI released details on her death and the people they believe may be tied to it. According to a statement released on Saturday afternoon investigators are looking for 30-year-old Megan Alyssa Colone of Stone Mountain 35-year-old Juan Ayala-Rodriguez of Gainesville 26-year-old Oscar Manuel Garcia of Austell and 29-year-old Mario Alberto Barbosa-Juarez of Oklahoma City Oklahoma.

A fifth person may also be involved but hasn't yet been identified. Authorities also said that Colonoe may be using the alias Grace Beda.

At this time investigators believe there's a chance that the five may no longer be in Georgia.

Anyone with information about the crime or the suspects is asked to contact the GBI tip line at 1-800-597-8477 visit their online tip website or download the ""See Something Say Something"" App."

The gift was made to the university’s School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) which recently recruited Caroline Freund a prominent economist at the World Bank to succeed Peter Cowhey as dean.

The Jacobs have been supporting GPS since 2006 and they have committed more than $300 million to UCSD projects since the late 1990s. The donations have been be used to do everything from help build a large university hospital in La Jolla to training engineers who focus on e-commerce and earthquake safety.

The new gift “will help (GPS) look at questions like whether it is more important for America to be a leader in electrical battery technology or quantum computing if it wants to remain a premiere center for innovation” Cowhey told the Union-Tribune on Friday April 23. “We also could look at whether the public health systems of low-income countries can be vastly improved by 5G” or fifth-generation broadband technology.

Both questions are of great interest locally. Qualcomm is the world’s largest maker of smartphone chips and is a leader in 5G technology. UCSD has a major battery-technology research program. The campus also is home to the San Diego Supercomputer Center and one of the largest computer science programs in the country.

Irwin Jacobs’ donations have been particularly important UCSD’s rise in engineering and medicine — and in the hybrid field known as in bioengineering.

At 87 he continues to nurture the program — and track how technology is evolving internationally.

“If you look at things driven by the pandemic you’ll see a lot of fast progress” Jacobs said on Friday April 23. “We’re all becoming more used to telecommunting telehealth mobile health. Education resists (this) a bit. I think we’ll find out how to do that better remotely.

“We’re seeing change. The problem is having people adjust to those changes enough so that they might benefit from them and don’t fight them.

The $14 million gift also will support Pacific Leadership Fellows a program in which leaders from around the world live in San Diego for a while to share knowledge about their home countries.

The fellows have included such figures as Agustín Carstens who served as finance minister under Mexico President Felipe Calderón and Yoriko Kawaguchi the former minister for foreign affairs in Japan.

UCSD is trying to build on its broad foundation in international affairs. Its GPS program has several well-known China experts including Susan Shirk and it is heavily involved in nuclear deterrence and non-proliferation policy.

Cowhey recently advised the Biden administration on how to better compete with China in science and technology and he has brought several prominent speakers to campus including former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

NeoKylin 7.0 (China only)

Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)

The OS section can be a big deal. Sometimes the units are advertised as supporting Windows 10 but one gets a Windows 10 Home license. If you want to or may want to run Windows 10 Pro knowing exactly which OS is on the device is ultra important. Having Ubuntu Linux installed from the factory is nice since we know many of our readers will use these with Linux. We also had our system running Proxmox VE as a Linux virtualization node but that is not an officially supported OS. Ubuntu installed without issue. One also usually needs to make BIOS tweaks in order to run Linux on Lenovo machines since they are optimized for Windows but we did not with our test unit.

Note: These systems sometimes change specs mid-generation. If you find another spec sheet with items you think we should add please let us know in the comments.

Next we are going to look at the performance and power consumption before getting to our final words.

Dell OptiPlex 7080 Micro Performance and Power Consumption

Instead of going through the entire Linux-Bench test suite we are going to show a few performance and power numbers here to give a general sense of performance. We actually planned to do storage testing but then we realized that there was a huge variability in terms of what drives could be found in machines.

Python Linux 4.4.2 Kernel Compile Benchmark

This is one of the most requested benchmarks for STH over the past few years. The task was simple we have a standard configuration file the Linux 4.4.2 kernel from kernel.org and make the standard auto-generated configuration utilizing every thread in the system. We are expressing results in terms of compiles per hour to make the results easier to read:

One thing is for sure in terms of total compute capacity even with a 35W TDP limit the Core i5-10500T is quite a bit behind the top-end CPUs in this space like the Core i9-10900T and Ryzen 7 Pro 4750GE. For some time we had seen more compression in these numbers but from what we have seen with the Intel Core i5-10500T it is both a big upgrade over previous generations but well behind the top-end models.

7-zip Compression Performance

7-zip is a widely used compression/ decompression program that works cross-platform. We started using the program during our early days with Windows testing. It is now part of Linux-Bench.

Something we are trying to show in these charts is the progression from the Core i5-6500T to the Core i5-10500T. Adding Hyper-Threading in this segment (finally) is yielding some solid performance gains. Here is a quick snapshot of the line over five generations:

The key is that pre-Ryzen we had 4 cores/ 4 threads and small generational improvements. Now post-AMD Ryzen we are at 6 cores/ 12 threads and around twice the performance of the Core i5-6500T.

OpenSSL Performance

OpenSSL is widely used to secure communications between servers. This is an important protocol in many server stacks. We first look at our sign tests:

Here are the verify results:

This chip is roughly equivalent to an Intel Core i7-8700T. They are not the same but the performance in our testing was very close. The Core i7-8700T had the same 6 cores/ 12 threads and 12MB of L3 cache along with somewhat similar clock speeds. Perhaps this makes sense. We feel fairly comfortable saying we have Core i7 performance at the Core i5 level two generations later just with newer features such as more USB 3.2 Gen2 from the Q470 PCH and the newer platform.

Next we are going to take a look at power consumption before getting to our key lessons learned and final words.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZ25zcy5jb20vdGhlLXBvd2VyLWFuZC10aGUtbWFnaWMtb2YtbDUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Time and the Place: The Power and the Magic of L5,"As stated in these pages last September every GNSS user in every segment can benefit from the new modernized signals in the L5 band. Foremost among these are likely to be smartphone users.

And who isn’t a smartphone user?

L5 signals are more accurate more reliable and are currently available in sufficient numbers between 16 GPS satellites plus Galileo and BeiDou to support all user segments.

L5 has several advantages over L1: signal structure wide bandwidth pilot codes other GNSS signals with a common structure stronger transmission lower bit error rate and cross correlation and a cleaner band.

“The use of L5 signals provides the capability of delivering 10x higher precision than a legacy L1 GNSS receiver in an open environment as well as very noticeable benefits in multipath environments” said Charlie Abraham Broadcom Senior Director of Engineering for the Wireless Communications and Connectivity Division.

“Broadcom’s 2nd generation dual-frequency GNSS BCM47765 chip utilizes every available L5 signal in space which totals over 80 signals including the 30 new BeiDou3 B2a signals. When BCM47765 is combined with the 3D Building Model correction service from Google the solution provides pedestrian users with sidewalk-level accuracy in urban canyons.”

That’s the magic. As cogently explained in our cover story L5 and 3D mapping-aided GNSS go together “like bread and butter.” We leave it to Google as we leave so much these days to explain this further on page 42.

“Google’s 3D mapping aided corrections are a major advancement in personal location accuracy for smartphone users when walking in urban environments” said DeMarco Chou of MediaTek. “Our Dimensity 5G family enables 3D mapping aided corrections in addition to its highly accurate dual-band GNSS and dead reckoning performance to give the most accurate global positioning ever for 5G smartphone users.”

A second technical feature in this issue “Catching a Ride: Improvements to Position Accuracy for eMobility Applications” demonstrates why Lyft intends to build L5 capability into the rental scooters and e-bikes on which we can soon flutter around downtowns. So green so green.

Chip manufacturers and telecomm companies are well out in front of the trends on this. They have to be.

“Qualcomm Technologies is leading the charge to improve consumer experiences with its newest Qualcomm Location Suite technology featuring support for dual L1/L5 frequencies sensor-assisted positioning towards lane level and sidewalk accurate navigation—all of which we make available in our flagship portfolio of Snapdragon Mobile Platforms” said Francesco Grilli vice president of product management at Qualcomm Technologies Inc.

To be sure modern smartphones and mobile devices use a lot more than GNSS to achieve lane-level vehicular or sidewalk pedestrian accuracy. They employ network-based location and assistance sensor assistance including dead-reckoning and correction services that bring precision similar to that of RTK which is not practical to implement in phones.

Finally at a company devoted singlemindedly to that select new band Greg Turetzky VP Product at OneNav volunteers “We are excited to see the performance improvement from our PureL5 GNSS System which uses the entire 50MHz bandwidth of all the signals in the L5 band to produce rich measurement data. When combined with Google’s 3D building models this will provide near meter-level accuracy in the urban canyons for mobile phones users and improve user experience in multiple applications.”

Although the L1 signal structure could be characterized as “outdated” vulnerable to cross correlation jamming and spoofing it won’t go away anytime soon. Its installed base is too large its use paths so well known and well worn. On the other hand L1 could come to resemble one of these days black and white TV. Still around still employed by some in some situations but not as they say the leading brand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hhZHZpc29yLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzc0MzYwMS93aWxsLWFybS1wcm9jZXNzb3JzLWJlY29tZS10aGUtbmV3LXN0YW5kYXJkLWZvci1sYXB0b3BzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will ARM Processors Become the New Standard for Laptops?,"For much of the 21st century one company has had a monopoly over CPUs. Intel with its x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) architectures has been overwhelmingly the dominant player with other manufacturers struggling to get a look in.

However that’s begun to change in recent years. AMD’s first Ryzen processors were launched in 2017 and have since gone on to become a major rival to Intel for both laptops and desktop PCs. In the same year fellow US company Qualcomm launched its first ARM-based Windows 10 devices.

These used the Snapdragon 835 processor which had previously been seen only in flagship smartphones and tablets. Performance didn’t match expectations and – on top of that – there were software compatibility issues and not all apps would run on ARM chips.

But they did offer some key benefits over Intel (and AMD) chips. With less of an emphasis on performance Qualcomm was able to deliver excellent battery life on laptops. It also meant they ran cooler often negating the need for fans and having the side benefit of making them thinner and lighter too.

Qualcomm has steadily improved its ARM-based CPUs across two further generations while a partnership with Microsoft has seen the custom ‘SQ1’ and ‘SQ2’ processors included in the Surface Pro X. However niggling software and performance issues mean the Intel-powered Surface Pro 7 remains the best Microsoft 2-in-1 for most people.

But at the point where many thought that the ARM experiment had failed as far as PCs and laptops were concerned Apple promptly ditched Intel and put ARM-based chips in its latest MacBooks and iMac.

This surely is a clear sign that ARM-based processors will soon become widely adopted in Windows laptops.

The company having used Intel for years (14 to be precise) decided to pursue its ‘ Apple Silicon’ project in 2020. And with its M1 chip Apple appears to have found a way to deliver both great performance and battery life while making it relatively easy for developers to optimise their apps so they can run on M1-based devices.

It’s rare for a company to produce a first-gen product that’s so compelling and there’s no reason why Qualcomm (or another manufacturer) can’t replicate this success on Windows devices. As you’ll see there’s plenty to like about ARM-based CPUs but there are still some areas to work on.

Design

Using ARM-based chips open up designers’ options. The most notable is a fan-less chassis borne out of the reduced load on the CPU and other components. The M1 MacBook Air is the most high-profile example of this with near-silent operation making for a more enjoyable user experience in many scenarios.

The M1 MacBook Air is one of a growing number of fanless laptops.

Without the need for a separate GPU advanced cooling system or huge battery ARM-based devices also tend to be more lightweight and portable. Performance will be slightly compromised in some situations but it’s a worthwhile trade-off if you’re planning on regularly using your laptop while out and about or simply on the sofa.

It also paves the way for different form factors most notably a greater range of 2-in-1 devices. These typically have a smaller screen than regular clamshell laptops but make up for it with the extra flexibility of a detachable screen.

Despite this many manufacturers still make ARM-based devices that look identical to the Intel equivalent. Perhaps it’s just too early to see those changes.

Battery life

Battery life is where ARM-based processors excel. A more simplistic CPU instruction set and improved power efficiency means they consistently outperform equivalent Intel-powered laptops in this area.

That’s perhaps most apparent on Samsung’s Galaxy Book S powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx. It lasted an incredible 25 hours in our battery benchmark despite having a relatively small 42Whr battery. It’s a similar story with Apple’s M1 MacBook Air which lasted more than six hours longer than the Intel version despite having an identically-sized cell.

Samsung’s Galaxy Book S is our current battery champ.

If battery life is your top priority ARM-based devices are the way to go.

Performance

Performance is the most hotly contested arena for ARM processors. On the Windows side it’s the something they still struggle with when compared to equivalent devices from Intel or AMD. That’s why Apple really surprised everyone: the M1 has proven that ARM chips can match or even surpass x86 and x64 CPUs pound-for-pound. That doesn’t quite extend to gaming though with MacBooks rarely used for for playing the latest titles (and most aren’t even available for Macs).

Qualcomm hasn’t been able to deliver the same results yet but 2020’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 was its best effort yet. With AMD Microsoft and Samsung all rumoured to be working on ARM laptop processors of their own it doesn’t feel like long before performance will no longer be an issue.

Software

Compatibility issues are something ARM-based systems have faced since they first launched.

It was the biggest problem with the original Surface Pro X although the situation improved significantly when the second generation launched. Microsoft has now released x64 app emulation for ARM-based Windows devices meaning (in theory) any app designed for a regular Intel-powered laptop will be able to run properly.

However this doesn’t extend to system-level services such as utilities or antivirus software.

Backing up

Until recently a major omission from the ARM ecosystem on Windows was effective backup software. This is considered one of the fundamentals of modern PCs and without it ARM-based PCs may struggle to attract everyday consumers.

However even that hole has been filled by Zinstall an app that’s considered to be the first full backup software for Windows on ARM. It’s able to back up files apps and settings automatically. These can then be stored locally on an external storage device (such as a NAS drive or SD card) or via a cloud storage service.

Zinstall also includes a transfer feature which allows you to move all your data from an Intel/AMD laptop to ARM-based PC. This works in a similar way to moving between other Windows devices aiming to make the transition as smooth as possible.

There are still some hurdles to overcome before the majority of laptops are packing ARM processors instead of Intel or AMD chips. However the success of Apple’s M1 shows that ARM-based processors could become the new standard for Windows laptops (and maybe even PCs).

The M1 may even lead to Intel and AMD rethinking their long-term strategy – ARM chips look like they have a bright future ahead of them.

Michigan legislation aims to make that happen | GreenState,"LANSING – Legislators have introduced bills that would if passed outlaw the sale of synthetic urine and ban billboard marijuana ads.

The Senate has voted to ban the sale of synthetic urine and other products used to falsify drug tests.

Synthetic urine is water mixed with additives such as creatinine salts uric acid and yellow coloring to replicate human urine according to Quest Diagnostics a New Jersey-based clinical laboratory that provides drug testing for employers across the country.

The bill introduced by Sen. Curt VanderWall R-Ludington passed the Senate 33-1. It’s pending in the House.

“There is no legitimate use for these products other than to cheat on alcohol or drug screening tests and therefore they should not be available on the marketplace” VanderWall said.

Sen. Jeff Irwin D-Ann Arbor was the only senator to vote against the bill.

Despite legal recreational use of marijuana in the state businesses can legally conduct drug screenings for employees or during the hiring process.

The bill follows a rise in drug use and substance use disorders caused by the pandemic according to the American Psychological Association.

“I don’t really have an objection to them banning synthetic urine but physical tests I believe are the wrong method to determine whether people are impaired at work” said Matthew Abel the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

These “physical tests” – such as urine oral and hair tests – measure the blood-plasma concentrations of THC similarly to the blood alcohol content of an alcohol breathalyzer test. THC is the principal psychoactive compound in cannabis that produces a high sensation.

The difference however is that blood-plasma concentrations of THC are an indicator of exposure not impairment according to a 2019 report from the Michigan Impaired Driving Commission.

That’s due to the varying ways THC is consumed and processed by the body. People with a higher tolerance or body fat percentage for example could have higher levels of the drug in their system but be fully functional.

“The people who keep focusing on blood I think are using that as a smokescreen” Abel said. “If they really cared whether people are impaired or not they would test whether people are impaired.”

Abel a Detroit attorney and founder of Cannabis Counsel a law firm suggests the use of Druid – a video game-like app that tests impairment and motor function.

The system requires a sober baseline test and can be readministered by an employer any time after to test possible impairments and delayed reaction times from drugs alcohol or even injury.

“If someone is at a desk what do we care if they’re smoking weed on the weekends?” Abel said. “And if they’re driving a truck what do we care as long as they’re clean and sober while at work?”

Bills have also been introduced by Reps. Mary Whiteford R-Casco Township and Abdullah Hammoud D-Dearborn to ban the advertisement of medical and recreational marijuana sales on billboards.

“We can’t have tobacco on billboards so why can we have marijuana?” Whiteford said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ebenhack/Associated Press

The Undertaker admitted during an interview this week that watching WrestleMania 37 from home wasn't an easy experience.

Speaking to Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated Taker discussed what was going through his mind as he watched the two-night event that emanated from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida:

""I was fine all the way until that first ballyhoo of fireworks. Fortunately I was home which made it a little easier but going through the show and watching I kept thinking to myself 'You should be there.'

""I had to work through that. It's a little difficult once WrestleMania starts. I started second-guessing myself. So much of my history revolves around WrestleMania. There was a bit of an emotional tug of the heartstrings watching this year but it's time for me to step aside and let this next generation have the reins and go where they're going to go.""

The Undertaker is synonymous with WrestleMania as he started his career 21-0 on The Grandest Stage of Them All before falling to Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 30.

Overall The Deadman went 24-2 at The Showcase of the Immortals which is one of the most remarkable stats in the history of pro wrestling.

Taker beat AJ Styles in a Boneyard Match at last year's WrestleMania 36 and he later announced during the Undertaker: The Last Ride docuseries on WWE Network that the win over Styles would be his final match.

As seen throughout the series however The Undertaker thought and said that before only to return when called upon by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon.

Things are seemingly different this time though as Taker told Barrasso that he knew midway through the match with Styles that he was done since it ""became really obvious throughout the course of that night that I could no longer physically do things the way I want to do them.""

It is safe to assume that fans being in attendance for WrestleMania 37 made things a bit tougher for The Phenom as his last match was wrestled without a crowd due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The desire to close out his career in front of the WWE Universe may be something that will eventually become too great for him to ignore but for now the 56-year-old veteran is staying true to his word by remaining retired.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbi1uYXkuY29tL29iaXR1YXJ5L2xlb25hLWZlYXRoZXJzdG9uZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Obituary | Leona Virginia ""Lee"" Perkinson Featherstone of Lexington Indiana","

Tom Brady led Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the Super Bowl LV title in epic fashion earlier this year. The veteran NFL quarterback threw for 201 yards with 3 passing TDs in the final as the Bucs defeated Kansas City Chiefs by a comprehensive 31-9 scoreline. Apart from Brady and Tampa Bay’s defense another player who grabbed eyeballs during the win was TE Rob Gronkowski.

Since returning from retirement ‘The Gronk’ has 700+ receiving yards and 9 receiving TDs to his name (including playoffs). He will be key for the Buccaneers when the season starts in September. But in the meantime he has something else to be excited about.

Michael Irvin Picks THIS Player as the Best Wide Receiver in 2021 NFL Draft Class

Rob Gronkowski etches his name in Guinness Book of World Records

Prior to his arrival in the NFL back in 2010 as the 42nd overall pick by the Patriots Rob Gronkowski was ‘balling’ while at the University of Arizona. The promising tight end played under head coach Mike Stoops between 2007-09. He had 1197 receiving yards and 16 receiving TDs during his time in Arizona.

But earlier this week Gronkowski returned to his Alma Mater and made headlines once again. The Super Bowl LV champions caught a football thrown from a helicopter 600 feet above the ground. In doing so he is now the holder of the a Guinness World Record.

The previous world record was 563 feet and was held by YouTube personality Tyler Toney. Almost immediately after making the catch Rob was mobbed by Arizona players who were just glad to have the NFL superstar attend their 2021 spring game.

Rob Gronkowski has a knack for pulling off some crazy stuff not just on the football field mind you. Here are some of the funniest moments from his short career in the WWE.

RTX,RTX Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldGhlcmV1bS1taW5lci0zMi1udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC1ncHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Ethereum ASIC Mines Like 32 GeForce RTX 3080 GPUs,"Chinese mining firm Bitmain has released a teaser of the company's upcoming Antminer E9 Ethereum miner. The company stated that the Antminer E9 would launch very soon although it didn't commit to a specific date.

The Antminer E9 could be the answer to gamers' prayers. If cryptocurrency miners jump on this new ASIC miner they could forgo buying Nvidia's Ampere offerings and maybe just maybe gamers will finally be able to pick up a gaming graphics card. The shelves won't magically fill themselves since cryptocurrency miners aren't the sole cause of the graphics card shortage; we can also blame the pandemic for that as well. Perhaps we could see more stock on the market though.

The Antminer E9 reportedly delivers an Ethereum hash rate up to 3 GH/s equivalent to 32 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 (Ampere) graphics cards mining in unison. If Bitmain delivers on its promise the Antminer E9 will be the fastest ASIC miner available and even outperform Linzhi's Phoenix Ethash ASIC miner that delivers up to 2600 MH/s.

Bitmain didn't reveal too many details about the Antminer E9 except that it draws up to 2556W and flaunts a power efficiency of 0.85 J/M. Therefore the Antminer E9 isn't just faster than the Phoenix miner but also more energy-efficient. For comparison the Phoenix miner pulls 3000W meaning the Antminer E9 has 14.8% lower power consumption.

Obviously an ASIC miner of the caliber of 32 GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards will not come cheap. The current speculation on Twitter is that the Antminer E9 could sell for over $20000 easily. Linzhi's Phoenix miner sells for between $11300 and $13700. Even at $30000 the Antminer E9 could be a very attractive option for mining farms since GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards start at $2500 nowadays and purchasing 32 of them comes down to a whopping $80000.

On the other hand Nvidia probably won't be too pleased with the news of the Antminer E9 since the chipmaker's Ampere graphics cards are selling like hotcakes. Let's not forget that between $100 to $300 million of Nvidia's Q4 revenue originated from cryptomining sales alone.

On top of that Nvidia recently rolled out its Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) products that focus on Ethereum mining. A little over a week ago Nvidia updated its Q1 forecast for CMP sales to peak at $150 million three times higher than its original estimate.

The Antminer E9 won't put a dent in Nvidia's cryptomining business unless Bitmain can produce the Ethereum miner on a large scale.

Bitmain announced its new mining Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called Antminer E9.

The device is officially coming soon just in time when Ethereum hits its record high value. The Antminer E9 is an ASIC offering as much as 3 Gigahashes/s. This is equivalent to thirty-two GeForce RTX 3080 graphics cards combined and working in a single cluster.

Chinese Bimain announced that that the Antminer E9 will launch soon but the company provided no release date nor the price of the machine itself. Due to the global shortage of components it is likely that the price of the machine will also be very high yet still a lot more cost-effective than buying all 32 RTX 3080 graphic cards instead.

In comparison to already existing solutions an ASIC machine called Linzhi Phoenix Miner can only offer 2.6 Gh/s. It costs as much as 13300 to 13700 USD which means that the Antminer E9 will easily cost at least that much. The S9 ASIC however will also be more power-efficient than any existing solution. Compared to 32 RTX 3080 graphics cards which would consume around 7500 watts the S9 is only requiring 2556 watts according to the promotional video. The power efficiency of 0.85 J/M will be even better than the Pheonix miner which requires 3000 W while offering a lower hashrate.

The Antminer E9 is not expected to disturb the situation in the global GPU market. It would require a great supply to meet the global demand for ETH-capable devices and that’s something ASICs are always late and unable to do.

We regularly receive photos from mining farms from frustrated gamers who simply want a new GPU for entertainment. In many cases that is simply not possible right now. Mostly because new GPUs are either expensive or not available at all. The situation is still so bad that Chinese miners are still buying all stock of new gaming laptops just to use their discrete GPUs for mining. Here’s a photo of the just-released Lenovo 5 Pro in a mining farm:

Black-centered stories are finding fertile and profitable ground on screens across Asia judging by the success in the region of blockbuster movies like Marvel’s Black Panther and Disney-Pixar’s Oscar-nominated Soul. Netflix’s newest Japanese anime series set to debut globally on April 29 hopes to ride this wave. Based on a true story Yasuke shines a spotlight on the remarkable rags-to-riches tale of Japan’s first Black samurai.

Although Yasuke is a forgotten and fabled figure his real-life journey from stolen slave to star samurai is ripe for Hollywood.

Little is known about Japan’s first foreign samurai one of only nine. But historians believe Yasuke was abducted from his home—some speculate present-day Mozambique—and auctioned off to the Italian Jesuit priest Alessandro Valignano during the 16th century.

When Yasuke arrived on the shores of Kyoto at 24 or 25 years old as Father Valignano’s slave and personal bodyguard onlookers fought to get a glimpse of the first African to ever step foot in the country. According to letters from Portuguese missionary Luis Frois and a 17th-century book called The History of the Church of Japan cited in an account of Yasuke by Japanese historian Tetsushi Furukawa Yasuke was a towering 6-foot-2 tall man with skin like an “ox” or “charcoal.” Even servants tried to scrub the “black ink” off of him. Eventually his stature caught the attention of warlord Oda Nobunaga who promoted him to the sacred samurai class the highest-ranking social caste in war-torn feudal Japan.

15_SubSub_Key Moment4_YASUKE_04_0017_BRIGHTEN

From 1581 to 1592 Yasuke served Nobunaga who praised his strength describing his might as that of 10 men. But after Nobunaga’s death Japan’s new leaders looked down on Yasuke calling him an “animal” before returning him to the European missionaries and his story was forgotten says Furukawa a history professor at Otani University and editor of the Japan Black Studies Association. He and a group of scholars tried to unearth Yasuke’s buried history but academic records are scant.

That is where Yasuke’s true tale ends and Netflix’s supernatural six-episode series begins. The action-filled anime set in an alternative world of science fiction and fantasy is steeped with magic and robots. The show which took three years to make follows an African samurai warrior who returns to his life of violence in order to protect a mysterious girl from dark forces.

A growing legion of Blerds or Black nerds are praising Yasuke’s arrival. Anime suffers from a “real dearth of Blacks” and “the depictions of Blacks or of people made to resemble Blacks are drawn with exaggerated and imagined physical features of Blackness” says Garrett Washington an assistant professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Washington researches modern and traditional Japan and the broader interplay of race religion and nation in East Asia. He welcomes an anime that draws more nuanced portrayals of Black characters and the array of Black experiences across Japanese society. “There has long been a question of legitimacy of a Black person actually belonging in Japan” he says. “But this kind of historical fiction can help demonstrate that Blacks have been a part of Japan’s history and have their place in Japan just like anyone else.”

The world is watching more anime a $24 billion industry with massive global appeal. Streaming giants HBO Max and Disney+ want a slice of that pie too. Just last year Netflix invested hundreds of millions and dedicated an entire creative team to the genre. According to Netflix more than 100 million households around the globe watched at least one anime title on its service in 2020 up by 50 percent from the year before.

Yasuke is also well-positioned to move beyond the silver screen. A live-action film was slated to star Black Panther’s Chadwick Boseman before the late actor’s untimely death. The movie project is now scrapped but the legend and lore of Yasuke could still live to fight another day.

Here a broker caught up in an insurance wire fraud scheme had his licensed revoked as a result of his criminal conviction.

In March 2021 the California Department of Real Estate (DRE) revoked the broker license of Behnam Halali former broker officer at Amazing Realty a brokerage based out of San Jose.

In 2011 and 2012 before working for Amazing Realty Halali was employed by American Income Life Insurance Company as an independent contractor. There he and a number of coworkers conspired to defraud the company submitting hundreds of applications for fraudulent life insurance policies. Halali and his co-conspirators split the resulting fees among themselves.

Halali and others involved in the scheme left or were fired from American Income Life Insurance in 2012 and Halali obtained his broker license in 2013.

However when the conspirators were indicted for their insurance fraud scheme in February 2014 Halali failed to notify the DRE within 30 days of the indictment as required by real estate law.

In January 2018 Halali and his co-conspirators were convicted. Halali was sentenced to five years in prison and the conspirators were ordered to pay money losses of nearly $3 million to the life insurance company they defrauded.

Only a full year after Halali’s conviction in January 2019 did the DRE learn he was incarcerated and take action to suspend his broker license — an underwhelming response rendered even more absurd by the fact that Halali’s broker license actually expired in 2017.

Eventually in March 2021 the DRE decided Halali’s crimes bore a “substantial relationship” to his activities as a real estate broker and decided to revoke his license outright despite it having long been expired at this point.

The power of example

The amount of time it took for the DRE to take notice of and respond to Halali’s past criminal activities and current incarceration isn’t a good sign for its effectiveness as an agent of oversight. However oversight is the goal and the case of Behnam Halali brings to light an important function of the DRE — one that is as symbolic as it is practical.

Because Halali was imprisoned as the result of a felony conviction and his license had already expired the DRE’s revocation of his license clearly had little tangible effect on Halali himself. However Halali’s conduct serves as an example to other licensees.

The lesson here is a useful one that all real estate agents — even those not engaged in criminal insurance fraud schemes — will do well to keep in mind. Activities undertaken outside the scope of a licensee’s real estate practice often have a significant bearing on that practice. And in the case of misconduct when the DRE deems those activities “substantially related” to an agent’s licensed acts — a designation entirely at the DRE’s discretion — it will hold the licensee accountable.

Since the DRE no longer has a state-specific Code of Ethics tactics like revoking an already-expired license constitute a method of keeping ethics at the forefront of its agents’ minds. And while most licensees won’t find themselves in a position as dramatic as Halali’s it is always in an agent’s best interest to be aware of how conduct in other areas of their professional life may impact their real estate practice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGVyZXMtbXVjaC1kZWVwZXItbWVhbmluZy1iZWhpbmQtMjAwMDAwMDc3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a Much Deeper Meaning Behind 'Minari' Than Viewers Realize,"Those who have watched Minari know what a true treasure director Lee Isaac Chung was able to create.

The film — starring Steven Yeun Yeri Han and Alan Kim — highlights a Korean-American family's move from California to an Arkansas farm in the 1980s and their quest for stability and success amid arising challenges. Not surprisingly Minari's masterful storytelling and heartfelt acting has resulted in several awards and Academy Award nominations this year.

But while viewers may enjoy what they see on screen they might also find fulfillment from the deeper meaning behind the title of the Oscar-nominated film.

What does ""minari"" mean?

Minari is a plant native to East Asia and found in a lot of South Korean cooking according to FoodNetwork.com. Specifically this name describes what others call ""pennywort"" or ""water parsley"" and is known for its somewhat bitter and peppery flavor. It is sometimes but not always found in kimchi spicy fish soups and stews or paired with pork belly.

Speaking with The Wrap Lee Isaac Chung himself explained the beauty of minari and how it relates to the movie we all know and love today:

The interesting thing about it is that it’s a plant that will grow very strongly in its second season after it has died and come back. So there’s an element of that in the film so it grows very expansively without doing much to it. It’s a poetic plant in a way for me.

The acclaimed director went on to echo this minari metaphor while speaking with NPR about how he came to pen the outline of the movie. As he explained he jotted down 80 memories while at a local library and realized that there was a good story arc coming from the paper. The resilient image of minari meanwhile helped him frame the plot.

""Ultimately a patch of minari this Korean plant that the grandmother plants that my grandmother planted that ended up being the only thing that really thrived on that farm"" he told the outlet. ""So once I had those two poles in mind of where the story starts and where the story ends I just started to shape all the memories together into a narrative.""

He later reiterated in the interview how the minari plant specifically spoke to him: ""It's a hardy plant. It kind of grows in places where you can't grow anything else. It can take root in very poor soil conditions. And what it ends up doing is it actually revitalizes the soil. And it cleans up the water. It has a purifying effect.""

Executives who are leaving the organization are getting vested stocks valued at roughly $290 million The Wall Street Journal reports.

The executives' separation agreements include terms that allow stock they were awarded while working at the company to vest when they leave.

The company's Chief Executive Officer George Sherman who will be stepping down by July 31 has 1.1 million restricted shares valued at about $169 million as of Friday's close.

Frank Hamlin who resigned as chief customer officer in March had restricted shares valued at $33.5 million as of Friday.

The company's merchandising chief Chris Homeister who is planning to leave the company has 289000 restricted shares valued at around $43.6 million as of Friday.

Former GameStop finance chief James Bell had restricted shares of $43.6 million as of Friday.

Shares of video game retailer GameStop Corp. as well as other heavily-shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc . (NYSE: AMC) and BlackBerry Ltd. (NYSE: BB) skyrocketed in January amid a rally fueled by retail traders belonging to the subreddit channel r/WallStreetBets. The traders bid up the stocks to create a short squeeze.

GameStop's shares jumped last week after its CEO said he would leave before the end of July.

On April 13 the company said it is redeeming senior notes worth $216.4 million due in two years a move that would leave the company mostly debt-free.

GameStop's shares closed at $151.18 on Friday.

James R. ""Jim"" Malone

Naples - In Memoriam James R. ""Jim"" Malone 1942-2021 Founding Partner and Chairman Emeritus Qorval Partners LLC.

In life and in business there are a few select individuals where it is not only what they do but who they are that makes a difference. There will ever only be one Jim Malone. We feel as if we have lost three people: a business partner a friend a fatherly mentor.

It is with great sadness and loss that we share that the founding partner of QORVAL James R. ""Jim"" Malone passed away April 21 2021 after a valiant battle with cancer. A fight which in true Jim fashion he fought with fervor and passion defied all the odds and beat everyone's expectations.

Jim was the son of William R. and Marian (Bentley) Malone. Born in Cleveland Ohio and raised in Kokomo Indiana he chose Naples Florida as his residence. Considered one of the greats of turning businesses around transforming organizations and doing it with humility caring compassion fierce work ethic and his famous core values (integrity profit growth and fun) Jim's lifetime accomplishments are too numerous to summarize here – but Jim was best known for serving as CEO of six Fortune 500 companies in six industries.

Jim founded Qorval 25 years ago to help grow and transform business and spearhead hundreds of global and domestic turnarounds reorganizations mergers acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and strategic alliances.

Jim saved thousands of jobs and helped countless people. He was firm but fair and always the hardest working person at the table.

During his career in addition to being called upon by US Presidents world leaders board chairmen Congress Governors and Civic and Community leaders for his sage counsel Jim was also a member of the Board of Directors of NYSE-listed Ametek Inc. (AME) and Regions Financial Corporation (RF).

Jim was named by Governor Jeb Bush to serve as Chairman of the Board of Governors for the nations' third largest underwriter of property insurance Citizens Property Insurance Corporation of Florida spearheading its reorganization and stabilizing the insurance industry.

Jim was also the Chairman and co-founder of Florida based private equity firm Boyne Capital. Jim was a trustee and board member of the United Nations Business Council for 22 years a member of The Florida Council of 100 and served many civic and community organizations throughout his career. In 2001 he was one of the founders of the Naples Winter Wine Festival which has raised in excess of $220 million for children's charities in Collier County.

In 2011 Jim was inducted into the Howard County (Indiana) Hall of Legends.

Jim received his BS degree from Indiana University and was a graduate of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management Institute in International Management.

Surviving Jim is a beautiful family – daughters Deanna ""Dede"" Siegfried (Rick) and Lisa Malone Beebe (Paul) with Emily Malone; sons Gabriel Malone (Tracey) and Zach Malone (Carol Crofton) with Linda Richards Malone; wife Linda Moulder VanHorn Pletcher Malone with her sons Mike VanHorn (Karen) and Chris VanHorn (Shiela); Grandchildren Meyer and Catherine ""Cece"" Siegfried; Sarah Chris Brooke and Paul James Beebe; Mira and Grayson Malone. He is also survived by his sister Kathy Campbell (Dave); his oldest nephew David Campbell (Angie) and their children Ethan Zachary and Jillian; and youngest nephew Jim Campbell.

As a busy man Jim also had many hobbies which he tackled with passion. He loved golf model trains stamps photography cars boats airplanes wine dinner with friends a good cigar and international travel.

Jim's favorite quote which he shared with many of us is an excerpt from the poem ""Ithaka"" by Greek poet Constantin Cavafy inspired by Homer's Odyssey a tale of the legendary journey of Ulysses (Odysseus) which reads:

""As you set out for Ithika hope the voyage is a long one… full of adventures full of discovery full of good friends.""

Indeed Jim. Godspeed. You will be missed.

A memorial service will be held at a later date. For information please contact the family at lisambeebe@yahoo.com.

The presence of Ministers Kuleba and Zalkaliani is a token of the weight we attach to political and security cooperation with these countries. Together we speak in favour of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia and consistently support Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the two countries” declared Minister Rau.

Minister Zbigniew Rau’s programme of the visit also included a meeting with the president of Romania Klaus Iohannis (in the Trilogue format) Polish-Romanian Polish-Turkish and Polish-Georgian bilateral consultations. The top Polish diplomat also visited the exhibition “Allies. Poland-Romania. 1918-1939” in the Palace of Parliament to mark the centenary of the Polish-Romanian military alliance (3 March 1921).

The day before the consultations Minister Rau and his Romanian counterpart attended the conference “Security Challenges from the Baltic to the Black Sea Region. Vision of Romania Poland and Turkey” organised jointly by key analytical centres of the three countries – Centre for Eastern Studies from Poland New Strategy Center from Romania and Foundation for Political Economic and Social Research from Turkey.

***

The meetings of the so-called Polish-Romanian-Turkish Trilogue have been held regularly since 2012 (since 2016 - at the level of foreign ministers). They aim at strengthening cooperation between allies who represent the largest countries of the NATO’s Eastern Flank and coordinating positions on the core issues for the regional security. Previous meeting was held as a videoconference in April 2020. The ministers announced next meeting of this format to take place in Ankara next year.

At the conclusion of the meeting ministers of the three states adopted and signed the joint declaration.

Here are five different ways to show administrative professionals your gratitude for their hard work. Gifts To Cheer Them Up: According to staffing firm Robert Half gifts can help a manager express his gratitude to his support staff. A sweet treat gift basket or a book can show them their work is valued. Now that the pandemic has forced us indoors a video tribute or an e-card can also be a great gift idea.

XTorch on ‘Shark Tank’ (ABC)

Sharing their story the couple told the Sharks they were visiting Equatorial Guinea Africa The Dominican Republic and other remote areas where Keidy fell sick. The doctors couldn't figure out the disease and said she could die soon.

Moreover they gave Gene a bag of colorful pills and told him to make sure she took them all on time. Due to the lack of power or electricity he had to make do with a torch and see what all pills were to be given to his wife. That painful and heartbreaking experience made the couple embark on their entrepreneurial journey. Sharing the cost of their product Gene said it was available for about $55 and it took $18 to make it. ""Next time it will cost us $14 to make it"" he proudly added.

When quizzed about the sales he said that they had around $53000 last year and were hoping for $90000 this year. That didn't sit well with most of the Sharks and they opted out.

Kevin O'Leary said no first. Mark Cuban then said ""You have to be able to sell it. You haven't been able to tell us anything by the sales"" and said he didn't want to take it up. Daniel Lubetzky said no as well and then Keidy told him in her mother tongue to make sure Robert Herjavec had a good offer.



Robert then stumped everyone. ""I want to buy the entire company"" he told Gene and Keidy. His offer? A $400000 for 100% stake. Gene asked if he would pay a million dollars. Robert said no. He then gave a counteroffer for $500000. However Gene was in denial mode and said he would want at least $750000. The two then walked out of the Tank with no deal in hand.



""We feel we have got the device"" Gene said. Keidy added ""We cannot let them take our baby."" Once they were gone Kevin O'Leary made a snarky remark aimed towards Robert. ""$500000 for XTorch. Are you out of your mind?"" Robert then defended himself saying ""I like the product.""

Fans felt the couple should have taken the offer. ""I would have sold that company for $500K"" one posted. Another said ""Idk why Robert wanted the company but they should have took the offer."" A third chimed in ""They must have a lot of debt to turn down that buy out offer.""

""#XTorch got the business from the sharks with jokes. ""It's a flashlight!"" LOL!!! However it's not proprietary or patent. @RobertHerjavec is about to go all in with his over.

Will Daniel 86 of Ambler the owner of Wilco Electronic Systems Inc. and a pioneer in establishing cable television in Philadelphia died Sunday April 18 at Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health surrounded by family.

His family said he had been actively working until a few weeks ago.

Mr. Daniel began Wilco an African American private cable company in May 1977.

In 1980 Home Box Office the leading pay-television service granted Wilco a franchise to market its programming to multi-dwelling buildings. This was the first time HBO had granted a franchise to a minority-owned company in the eastern United States Wilco said in a news release on Mr. Daniel’s death.

In the Wilco statement David Cohen former senior executive vice president of Comcast who now serves as a senior adviser to Comcast Corp. described Mr. Daniel as a “Philadelphia icon.”

“He was a visionary businessperson who never lost sight of the community from which he came. He was a real partner to Comcast helping our company to expand in Philadelphia and to take root in the African American community. His advice was always prescient. His friends at Comcast will miss him but more importantly all of us in Philadelphia will miss his leadership and commitment to making lives better.”

Before starting his own company Mr. Daniel had worked for Marco Video Systems Inc. for 19 years. It was at Marco that he began designing and building cable systems.

Because of his early experience with cable Mr. Daniel worked with the administration of former Mayor W. Wilson Goode Sr. in the early 1980s to develop Philadelphia’s cable franchising process where cable companies had to bid to provide service in four areas of the city.

He was a partner and minority owner with the Rollins Cablevision franchise and later received equity when Rollins was sold to Comcast Cablevision.

After the Rollins sale Mr. Daniel began a 40-year friendship with Ralph J. Roberts founder of Comcast. Because of that relationship Wilco and Comcast created a partnership model where low-cost cable services were made available to underserved and low-income communities in Philadelphia.

In 2001 Wilco became the exclusive provider of cable television services for the Philadelphia Housing Authority the company said.

In January 2018 Comcast acquired Wilco’s cable assets and invested in significant upgrades to Wilco’s infrastructure at PHA sites. Comcast now provides residents with access to Comcast Xfinity products including Internet Essentials its internet service for low-income families.

Wilco is now focused on installing low-voltage wiring and design for access control systems necessary for the concept of “smart homes.”

“We have pivoted our business to the foundation of what my father started” said Brigitte Daniel-Corbin CEO and president of Wilco.

But the wiring the company is installing today is for new technologies where physical objects are embedded with sensors and software so that lighting systems security cameras thermostats and other appliances can be controlled by smart phones.

She said she learned from her father about people and relationships and the importance of cultivating those relationships. She said integrity was a big part of his character. “He always talked about keeping your reputation strong and keeping it high.”

“As a father I loved him and he loved me dearly” Daniel-Corbin said. “I am so honored he instilled so much trust in the legacy of his business in me.”

Will Daniel was born in February 1935 in Roanoke Rapids N.C. to John and Mary Daniel. He was the ninth of 11 children. Daniel-Corbin said her father gained his work ethic from being part of the family’s farming business.

“What he learned was the importance of hard work” she said. “You get up early go work on the farm and then you go to school. That hard work ethic was what he brought to Philadelphia and he maintained those skills until his last weeks.”

After completing school Mr. Daniel served for three years in the Army where he began learning electronic and communications skills.

Upon leaving the Army in 1955 he returned to North Carolina before moving to Philadelphia the following year where Mr. Daniel studied electronics at a vocational school and then went to work for Marco Video Systems.

During his early years in Philadelphia Mr. Daniel married his first wife Victoria with whom he had two sons. That marriage ended amicably in a divorce his daughter said.

About the time he started Wilco he married his second wife Virginia Smith a Philadelphia schoolteacher. The couple had one daughter Daniel-Corbin. After 25 years that marriage also ended in an amicable divorce.

About 2006 he married his third wife Lucille.

Daniel-Corbin said her father maintained friendly relationships with his former wives and often brought all members of his family together for family functions.

For 40 years Mr. Daniel was an active member of Salem Baptist Church in Jenkintown. He later joined Bethlehem Baptist Church in Spring House.

In addition to his daughter wife Lucille and former spouses Mr. Daniel is survived by sons Darryl and Vance; six grandchildren; three great-grandchildren and other relatives and friends.

People may pay their respects to Mr. Daniel from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday April 29 at Bethlehem Baptist Church 712 Penllyn Pike Spring House..

A funeral service will be livestreamed on Friday April 30 starting at 9 a.m. at bbc4christ.org and bbandhodges.com. The actual service will begin at 11 a.m.",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to a letter sent to the crew this decision is based on various reasons and related to recently announced travel restrictions and complexities with crew movement to and from India. This decision is effective immediately and at the time being Royal Caribbean is canceling all crew movements from India until further notice.

“It’s always unfortunate when we must cancel assignments but we believe this is a prudent decision at this time. We know how much our crew look forward to returning to work after waiting for so long. We also understand how tough it can be to have to make last minute travel changes. It’s not the way that we want to operate but it is the reality of the quick changes we need to make based on different reasons that are often unplanned and beyond our direct control.” reads Royal Caribbean International letter.

According to our source around 300 Indian crew members assigned to join Anthem of the Seas on May 3 were canceled. Indian crew were supposed to join Adventure of the Seas some of them are already in St Marten and will not be allowed to embark the ship said one crew member.

“Those crew members who are currently at hotels pending joining a ship or are currently en route (already flying) will be notified and accommodation will be provided under quarantine guidelines till further notice.

The company is kicking off several activities across the region to encourage female students to consider careers in Information Communications and Technology (ICT) industries.

The ICT space continues to rapidly evolve opening up a plethora of career opportunities yet there are still concerns about the low representation of females in the sector.

“Globally the percentage of females following a course of study in STEM education remains low. Girls in ICT Day is therefore an opportunity for us to continue connecting with our girls to provide mentorship and showcase careers in the sector while connecting them to female pioneers in the industry. As we champion greater inclusion and diversity in the workplace we are mindful of the need for more balance and female representation in our industry and so our activities this year are geared towards that purpose” said Inge Smidts CEO of C&W a leading communications and entertainment provider and one of the largest employers of ICT engineering and other technical workers in the region.

C&W will stage a video essay competition for female students aged 12 – 15 years old across the region. Participants will be asked to submit a 2 – 3 minute video on the topic: “Why is it important for girls/women to pursue a career in ICT?”

Details will be shared when the competition opens on April 26 and winners will be announced at the company’s Girls in ICT Forum on June 8 2021.

He was 66.

Yesterday SRI described Roper who joined the Sandals family in 1986 as general manager at the time of the acquisition of Sandals Royal Caribbean as a beacon of leadership.

“He later joined the team at SRI where he was tasked with managing the company’s relationship with the travel trade” the company said adding that at the time of his passing Roper was director industry relations.

“The consummate Sandals ambassador he played an integral role in building out and strengthening our sales and industry relations division over the years forging key relationships with not only regional industry partners and stakeholders but also with critical international partners across the globe” SRI said.

“His passion for the Sandals brand and for the tourism industry which started even before his Sandals journey was unquestionable. He loved what he did and it showed in his unwavering commitment and in the way he immersed himself in his duties” the resort group added.

Roper’s welcoming personality and infectious laugh SRI said endeared him to everyone he met and interacted with and his sense of humour was among his finest traits.

The company also noted that he was a mentor to many people and delighted in regaling younger team members with stories about the history of the company. That resulted in him being fondly referred to as the Sandals ‘encyclopedia’ as he was always willing to share facts and figures about the company.

SRI also noted that as an avid lover of cricket Roper worked closely with Sandals’ late founder and chairman Gordon “Butch” Stewart to facilitate the company’s sponsorship of West Indies cricket from as far back as 1995 and the early 2000s and most recently from 2018.

“He was truly passionate about the sport and was proud to lead the charge of aligning our brand with this powerful Caribbean sporting institution” SRI said.

“Cricket was however not the only sport he loved. He was also a football fan and would often engage fellow team members in passionate discussions either vociferously lamenting the poor performance of his team or happily celebrating their victories.

“A gentleman through and through David Roper was to Sandals as Sandals is to the all-inclusive sector. To say he will be missed would truly be an understatement. His contribution to our company’s success over the years is immeasurable and his impact on the lives of many of our team members especially those within his division is more than words can capture” the resort group stated.

“We extend our deepest sympathies to his family including his brother Brian general manager at Beaches Ocho Rios; his wife Donna and children; and to our entire Sandals family particularly his team in sales and industry relations — a team he led with passion and integrity over the years.

“His legacy as one of the longest-serving members of the Sandals Resorts team will live on forever and we will keep his memory alive by continuing to outpace our competition cementing our place as the ‘World’s Best All-Inclusive Company’ — exactly what he believed us to be” SRI said.

“We will keep the family in our prayers at this time allowing them time to process before announcing collaborative next steps in honouring the memory of our Sandals and tourism stalwart.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly9jYXltYW4ubG9vcG5ld3MuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvdG91cmlzbS1sZWFkZXJzLWdhdGhlci1maXJzdC1wb3N0LWNvdmlkLWV2ZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tourism leaders to gather for first post-COVID event | Loop Cayman Islands,"The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) 20th Global Summit organised in partnership with the Government of Quintana Roo will be held in Cancun Mexico on April 25-27.

""Uniting the World for Recovery"" will be this year's key theme for the annual Global Summit which will be first major live event in the Travel & Tourism sector since the onset of the global pandemic.

Now residents don't even recognise their home.

""It's like a desert it's desolate it's apocalyptic. The whole place is covered in grey ash"" Ralph Gonsalves the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines told CNN about the communities impacted by the eruptions.

It has been 42 years since La Soufrière volcano - French for sulphur outlet - erupted.

The 4247m stratovolcano is now making up for lost time blasting ash and debris miles into the air and neighbouring islands.

For months La Soufrière threatened to erupt and scientists warned residents to prepare to flee at any moment.

The government coordinated with cruise ship companies to begin ferrying people from the ""red zone"" where catastrophic destruction was expected to take place.

Then at 8.51am on April 9 the National Emergency Management announced La Soufrière had erupted.

Thanks to the early evacuations officials said there have been no deaths or injuries reported as a result of the eruption.

But more than 7000 residents have taken refuge in government-run shelters and a greater number are staying with friends or family said Mr Gonsalves the left-leaning Bible-quoting prime minister of the island chain who goes by the nickname ""Comrade Ralph.""

With more than 10 per cent of the island chain's 110000 residents at least temporarily homeless the local government does not have the resources to address all the need he said.

""We are not able to do the humanitarian effort we are not able to do the recovery we will not be able to without substantial assistance from the region and the global community.

""We are really at the midnight hour of need"" Mr Gonsalves said.

As the volcano continues to spew ash and pyroclastic flow a deadly mixture of superheated gases rock and mud the ongoing danger has complicated efforts to deliver aid.

""It's not like a hurricane where you get hit and it's over"" said Britnie Turner the CEO of Aerial Recovery Group a disaster management company bringing in supplies from the US.

The pandemic has also hurt efforts to help Vincentians impacted by the volcano she said.

""Donations across the world have dropped dramatically since COVID started but don't stop giving"" Ms Turner said. ""Even though we are all experiencing pain. Even though the world is a little bit of a different place we still need to help our neighbours.""

In Miami Michael Capponi the founder and executive director of the non-profit Global Empowerment Mission is filling containers with pre-packed boxes of food water face masks and hand gel to send to the island.

He called the disaster a ""migrational crisis"" as residents flee from the volcano to the south of the island and said his local partners on the ground still have been unable to assess the full extent of the damage.

""You have a foot of ash on everyone's roofs"" Mr Capponi said. ""You have all the crops that are completely destroyed that won't grow back for quite a while.

""Then you have boulders that were on fire that literally came through people's roofs.""

Mr Gonsalves said the government estimates that the volcano has already inflicted more than $100 million in damage in the last two weeks with much more likely to come as scientists predict the volcanic activity could last for four months.

The Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1 and even if St Vincent is spared a direct hit the heavy summer rains pose a new danger.

""There's a lot of material"" Mr Gonsalves said. ""Stone and ash and they rest on mud. The rains will lubricate and they will add to the weight and they will come down at a very fast pace.""

Mr Gonsalves said the disaster his country is facing may only be beginning. He said he has written President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for assistance.

If Japan’s Best Car can be believed Toyota thinks so and it’s dusted off the circa 2015 Toyota S-FR concept for production with the help of Daihatsu and Suzuki—two small car specialists the former of which is a Toyota subsidiary. Do we want to believe?

Of course we love the MX-5; we are enthusiasts who love sporty cars and Toyota’s no stranger to the segment. The last car it built in this class was the MR-2 Spyder a nominal Miata competitor that appealed to the quirkier and more hardcore enthusiasts. It had less curb appeal and more “budget Elise” mojo. But the S-FR (well the concept which is old) has one thing the MR2 Spyder doesn’t: undeniable cuteness. Rather than an amphibian shape made out of Duplos the S-FR is funky and organic—more Kermit and less Kerbal.

Forbes’ Japan-based reporter put hands on the exclusive Best Car report and from this we understand that the appeal of shared development costs and partner automakers is what makes the revival feasible. Well rumored revival. The evidence is thin to be clear. The Daihatsu Vision Copen apparently previews the bones of a future S-FR and seems an appropriate basis; the windshield surround and the doors look very S-FR. It’s rounded and cute. Toyota-izing it would be a simple task.

After all if Daihatsu is making a small convertible already it wouldn’t be difficult for Toyota to create a larger more powerful version at a different price point. Bringing in Suzuki’s small engine expertise would help reduce costs as well. Consider the BMW underpinnings of the latest Supra and the co-development of the GR86 and the Subaru BRZ. Toyota has signaled it won’t build a sports car without some aspect of it being shared or already in existence.

Best Car pegs the upcoming S-FR to debut in 2026 or 2027 with tweaked styling but a similar overall vibe to the 2015 S-FR concept and a 150-hp 1.3-liter turbo I-3 engine under the hood.

Plausible? Maybe. Probable? That’s another story entirely. And as for the U.S. market don't expect a Daihatsu-based anything to make it here; besides Toyota has the GR86 already which is essentially a roofed Miata fighter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpZ2hlaGFtaWx0b24uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYW50b25pby1mb250ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonio S.

We first covered Warrantee seven years ago when the company’s founder Yusuke Shono was selected as a finalist at HackOsaka 2014 an annual startup conference hosted by Osaka City. His rare experience that every single home appliance he bought when he started living alone was broken triggered him to launch his first business Warrantee aiming to convert all warranties into digital.

It may be often hard for us to find a warranty form when we specifically need it. He created the service because he thought it would be convenient to manage such warranties electronically but at first he had no idea about how to get companies to pay for it or how to grow the user base. They wondered if they could provide something like “If you register your warranty on the platform we’ll give you another year of warranty for free.” That was the beginning of their new insurance concept.

In late 2014 Warrantee received investment from Japanese cooking-recipe sharing site Cookpad (TSE:2193) and started exploring business synergy with them. This made Shono keenly aware of the strength of a complimentary service and he says “It’s amazing that (Cookpad) can attract so many users even though it’s free”. This may be another reason why Warrantee is focused on developing a complimentary service.

Shono said

Insurance for home appliances could be provided for free (as a way for sponsoring appliance manufacturers in return to obtain detailed user profiles) because it’s inexpensive but not for automobiles because of high price. But if for example we divide a year by 365 days and ask a companies to pay 200 yen a day for each user it could work.

Warrantee announced the launch of its first InsureTech business in 2017. Warrantee CEO Yusuke Shono (left) Tokio Marine Nichido Managing Executive Officer Yusuke Otsuka (right)

In 2017 Warrantee which had been touting themselves a warranty managing startup suddenly started talking about insurance. Through its experience launching insurance business Shono says his company could learn about Japan’s Insurance Business Act and how to coordinate with government agencies. Warrantee’s “Free Insurance” is a way of making on-demand insurance premium-free.

He explained

One example is our partnership between Japanese air-conditioner giant Daikin and property franchisor Century 21 Japan. Daikin wanted to connect with property owners (such as landlords) who owned a large number of air conditioners in their properties. However since air conditioners are typically sold through retailers or housing equipment companies Daikin had no profile of these air conditioner owners as end users. By having Daikin sponsor our product Warrantee provided property owners with an additional warranty for their air conditioners free of charge. In return Daikin could obtain the real estate owner’s profiles. It was a win-win situation for both Daikin and the property owners.

Despite its start with insurance for home appliances Shono’s company can provide the service even for clinics which typically own expensive medical equipments. In view of how pharmaceutical firms and medical equipment manufacturers approaching medical institutions we may imagine their sales representatives making on-site visits and phone calls but this is inefficient because medical professionals are often very busy. If Warrantee can provide give the firms sales channels in return for sponsoring Free Insurance for clinics medical professionals would be willing to find the time slot for meet-up.

He continued

Many manufacturers are pivoting their business model from product selling to subscription-based. For example before a product becomes obsolete or broken they can send customers a new model at no extra cost after 10 years of their first purchase. I believe that our Free Insurance is a great match for this trend.

The Free Insurance concept can be applied not only to “products” but also to “humans”. For example it may give osteoporosis patients calcium supplements for free or may allow people to sign up for complimentary health promotion services based on the result of their medical checkup. Some people may be reluctant to give out their profile but many may be willing to receive these rewards if the benefits outweigh the negatives.

He added



Japan has a universal health insurance system that allows all its nationals to receive advanced medical care at lower cost. But US and Singapore don’t so doctor bills there vary from hospital to hospital making it easy for us to launch the Free Insurance in these markets. In the US not only health insurance but also car insurance is expensive. We decided to open a branch office in Singapore because it is a good place to start something new.

Warrantee’s core members are located in Tokyo and Osaka but we finally learned why Shono has repeatedly visited Singapore despite the inconvenience of being quarantined for two weeks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Free Insurance business seems to be doing quite well although the amount of sales is unknown and the firm is aiming for an IPO in the US through an SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) in the near future sources say.

In February Evo Acquisition was incorporated as an SPAC to help get Japanese companies listed in the US. There will be more and more Japanese startups like Warrantee seeking a way out of the global market and aiming for a US IPO.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ADVERTISEMENT

The world’s biggest oilfield contractor joined rivals Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Co. this week in predicting expansion in overseas work and a more muted recovery in North America through the rest of 2021. Global oil demand should return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year if not sooner Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch told analysts on Friday.

“A new growth cycle has finally commenced” he said in a statement released on Friday. “There is an increasingly positive sentiment in the industry outlook as the recovery strengthens despite the lingering concerns regarding the Covid-19 crisis.”

The service sector that helps oil explorers detect and drill underground reserves is slowly returning to work after a global glut and pandemic-led lockdowns sapped energy demand triggering job cuts and bankruptcies across the industry. The big three contractors who this week posted better-than-expected first-quarter results are pivoting away from the once-booming North American shale patch and chasing work elsewhere instead.

Schlumberger said it expects an increase in U.S. onshore activity in the second quarter that will level off during the second half. But international activity is poised to continue ramping up through the end of this year and beyond.

Sales are expected to grow by mid-single digits this quarter while operating margins probably will expand by as much a percentage point Chief Financial Officer Stephane Biguet said during the call.

The shares which have climbed more than 50% in the past year rose 1.9% to $25.73 at 10:58 a.m. in New York.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Schlumberger’s sales of its North American completion and artificial-lift businesses increase its focus on overseas markets which may account for 80% of revenue in 2021. ... The balance sheet should support its reduced dividend payout though buybacks are unlikely until the pandemic subsides. -- Scott J. Levine and Justin Rothhaupt BI analysts Read the report here.

Le Peuch has cut tens of thousands of workers reshuffled the company’s business around the globe and sold off assets in North America in order to focus on overseas work. The service provider expects to generate about 80% of sales from international markets.

The company continues to work on a pair of asset sales including drilling rigs in the Middle East and a business in Canada that shares in the ownership of wells Le Peuch said.

The first-quarter results reflect Schlumberger’s shifting strategy with its lowest North American sales output since the start of the shale boom roughly a decade ago. While a seasonal drop in international revenue from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is typical Schlumberger said the 3% sequential drop during the quarter was its shallowest since 2008.

Meanwhile Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller told investors on Wednesday that early signs of an international recovery are already showing up in orders for tools.

“These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year” Miller said. “We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcHJlc3MudGlmZmFueS5jb20vYmVzdC1hY3RyZXNzLW5vbWluZWUtYW5kcmEtZGF5LXdlYXJzLXRpZmZhbnktY28tYXQtdGhlLTkzcmQtYW5udWFsLWFjYWRlbXktYXdhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Actress Nominee Andra Day Wears Tiffany & Co. at the 93rd Annual Academy Awards,"(Los Angeles CA): Andra Day nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for The United States vs. Billie Holiday dazzled in Tiffany & Co. diamonds at the 93rd Academy Awards tonight.

Robust activity growth in Saudi Arabia and Qatar helped to offset declines in revenue for global oilfield services contractor Schlumberger the company said.

Qatar has emerged as a top regional market for Schlumberger with growth helping to offset a decrease in revenue in some other markets across the Middle East and Asia.

The Texas-based company recorded a 5 percent sequential decrease in revenue – at $1.9 billion – in the Middle East and Asia but these declines were “partially offset by robust activity growth in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.”

Lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global oil market have caused the company to face a decline in net profits during the first quarter of the year.

However Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch said a global oil demand should return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year if not sooner.

“We are increasingly confident that our international revenue will see double-digit growth in the second half of 2021 as compared to the same period last year which implies potential upside to the already robust growth that is anticipated in 2022 and beyond” said Le Peuch.

It said that growth in both countries helped to offset declines in some other markets across the Middle East and Asia.



The US company reported an overall 20 percent decline in net profit to $299 million in the first quarter.



The result was still better than analysts had expected because of concerns of the lingering effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global oil market.

Onda Unleashes A Motherboard Offering 32 SATA HDD & SSD Storage Ports Dedicated For Chia Coin Cryptocurrency Mining

Manufacturers are already working to offer Chia Coin dedicated mining SSDs and it looks like motherboards are getting dedicated mining versions for the cryptocurrency too. The board in question is the Onda B365 D32-D4 Magic Edition which features a total of 32 SATA ports that supports up to 32 SATA-based HDD and SSD storage devices.

The motherboard is based on the Intel B365 chipset and features four DDR4 DIMM slots and a single PCIe Gen 3.0 x16 and PCIe 3.0 x1 slot. The board measures at a massive 530mm x 310mm and power are provided to the motherboard through a 24-pin ATX and a dual 8-pin connector configuration for the CPU. Technically what you are looking at is an mATX motherboard with an extended PCB to support all the SATA connections. I/O includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports 1 USB 2.0 4 USB 3.0 a VGA & HDMI port and power on/off buttons.

As per the details provided by Onda the motherboard has a total of six 6-pin connectors to power the SATA ports. The SATA ports can hold up to 448 TB storage capacity in either HDD or SSD NVMe standards.

The mining process of Chia Coin requires a large amount of free space and runs several reading & writing operations. In this case endurance (TBW) is equally as important as speed so consumer SSDs aren't the best choice for mining due to their lower endurance and running these operations will significantly reduce the lifespan of an SSD. Hence the target for these miners is primarily hard drives and data center SSDs. This motherboard could be a huge hit since Chia Coin mining is becoming more popular in the Asian Pacific region.

The Chia Coin Cryptocurrency has seen a large share of storage devices dedicated towards it which has prompted the rise in HDD prices across China. Tomshardware has a table which illustrates just how much the prices have risen over the last week:

Hard Drive Price Increase Current Price Lowest Price (1 week ago) Western Digital WD Gold 18TB 40.4% $1231 $877 Seagate Exos X18 18TB 66.7% $1077 $646 Seagate SkyHawk AI 18TB 39.4% $923 $662 Seagate Exos X16 16TB 60.6% $816 $508 Seagate IronWolf 16TB 56.2% $814 $521 Ultrastar DC HC550 16TB 30.3% $662 $508

There's no word on the pricing of this motherboard but it is already being sold directly to miners who are using this to build up their Chia Coin cryptocurrency inventory.

In the middle of that technology is Irvine’s Skyworks Solutions Inc. (Nasdaq: SWKS). Its stock has more than doubled in the past year to a market cap topping $30 billion making it the third most valuable publicly traded company based in Orange County.



“We think the stock outperformance is based on the continued anticipated rollout of 5G with 5G phone volumes expected to more than double this year versus last” Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra told the Business Journal.



“Skyworks is a primary beneficiary of this trend.”



Late last week the company said it will acquire the Infrastructure and Automotive unit of Silicon Laboratories Inc. (Nasdaq: SLAB) for $2.75 billion.



Skyworks said it’s a nearly $20 billion market opportunity as it will accelerate expansion into the industry’s most important growth segments including electric and hybrid vehicles 5G wireless infrastructure and smart homes among other areas.



“By leveraging our global sales channels operational scale and deep customer relationships Skyworks is well-positioned to drive above-market growth while diversifying revenues expanding margins and delivering strong returns in earnings and cash generation” Skyworks Chief Executive Liam Griffin said in a statement.



Some 350 employees including the senior management team of the business are expected to join Skyworks upon completion of the transaction.



The deal adds to a busy time for the chipmaker which is expected this year to see sales jump 46% to $4.9 billion.



One of the key reasons is that half of its sales go to tech juggernaut Apple.



“It has a lot to gain as iPhone fans purchase a new device with a 5G connectivity chip” according to an analysis last week in the investment site Motley Fool. “It’s won some other design contests for other tier one smartphone makers that could send sales soaring higher for the rest of the year.”



Last week Apple introduced a colorful new iMac an updated iPad Pro with 5G and a refreshed Apple TV 4K with a brand new remote. The newest versions of the iPhone and Apple Watch are expected later this year.



Gerra noted that Skyworks’ Broad Markets business should continue to benefit from the ramp of 5G in non-smartphone applications and 5G base stations.



Skyworks is one of three 5G stocks “to buy before they take off again” the Motley Fool website said.

The Conexant Connection



Skyworks can trace its history to Conexant Systems Inc. a Newport Beach-based company that reported $1.1 billion in sales for fiscal 2001 and once competed against Broadcom. In 2002 Conexant’s wireless communications business merged with Alpha Industries to create Skyworks. Last year it moved its headquarters from Massachusetts to Irvine.



It employed 10000 as of Oct. 2 including 7900 outside the U.S. with large labor forces in Mexicali and Singapore. It employs about 455 at its 218500-square-foot Irvine headquarters which includes a design center.



The company is known for specializing in radio frequency chips that manage wireless connections in smartphones and other wireless devices.



“We are connecting everyone and everything all the time” the company declared on its website. “As the demand for ubiquitous ‘always-on’ connectivity increasingly expands our innovative high performance analog semiconductors are enabling breakthrough communication platforms from global industry leaders—changing the way we live work play and learn.”



Its chips which have won several industry “breakthrough awards” can be found in previously unimagined applications within the automotive gaming and wearable markets its annual report said.



Besides Apple other key customers include the who’s who of the technology world including Google Samsung and Qualcomm. Its slight 0.6% decline in fiscal 2020 revenue was caused by one of its customers China’s Huawei being banned by the U.S. government.



In January Skyworks said it expected second-quarter revenue to be more than 45% above the same period a year ago. The average estimate by analysts is for a 50% jump to $1.15 billion; the company reports second-quarter results on April 29.

Because it's one of those snacks many people enjoy from childhood onward many families have a specific brand texture and flavor they prefer.

Curious about which ones top the charts (and fulfill appetites)? Statista conducted a survey to determine the most beloved peanut butter brands. By working with the United States Census and Simmons National Consumer Survey they asked households one question: ""Which brands of peanut butter have you eaten most in the last 30 days?"" The data was published in November 2020 so this includes the brands of peanut butter customers leaned on during the pandemic.

Here are the survey's findings on the most popular brands of peanut butter in the United States with #1 being the country's most popular peanut butter. It's a classic for a reason!

And if you're wondering how our taste compares to the rest of the nation We Tested 10 Peanut Butters and This Is the Best!

Jif

When it comes to tradition Jif is about as classic American as you can buy. It's been sitting pretty on pantry shelves since 1956 and it still ranks the highest in the country today. According to the study's findings 117.31 million folks consumed Jif in 2020 alone.

While creamy and crunchy peanut butter varieties are typically the go-tos of Jif fans the company has recently released even more nut butter options including almond butter and hazelnut spreads allowing them to remain competitive in the industry.

Skippy

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Believe it or not Skippy has been in grocery stores even longer than Jif starting in 1933 smack-dab in the middle of the Great Depression. While the company has gone through plenty of ebbs-and-flows over many decades it remains a contender for PB-loving families.

Data from the survey found an estimated 85.98 million people are Team Skippy. With snack packs and natural options they could be a solid solution for busy parents who need a quick fix for a hanger tantrum stat.

Store Brand

In the Statista survey 52.17 million people picked ""store brand"" a blanket term for anything sold by grocery chains. This includes Whole Foods 365 Target's spreads and Trader Joe's peanut butter varieties. It makes sense why this sector of sales would rank third in popularity as it's usually less expensive and more practical for budget-mindful households.

Peter Pan

Lost boys and imaginative children alike choose Peter Pan the original peanut butter brand founded in 1928. More than 90 years later it's still the fourth-ranking choice among Americans at 45.15 million strong according to the survey. Perhaps it's the creamy spread the crunchy bite or the plethora of options that make folks feel like they're flying to never-never-yum-land when they lick their spoons.

Nutella

We hate to be the ones to break this to the 38.91 million people who picked Nutella as their favorite peanut butter formula but um it's not actually PB. It's made of hazelnuts and cocoa powder giving it an irresistible dessert-like taste.

Though there's no denying Nutella (and its many store brand knockoffs) has a cult-like following for those looking for a high-protein snack this may not be the right choice. A serving of Nutella has just two grams of protein which is less than you'd find in traditional peanut butter.

Smucker's

Fun fact: Smucker's was founded as a jelly and jam company in 1897 making it the oldest contender in the survey. As they grew they expanded to include peanut butter and eventually the PB&J-in-one-jar ""Goober"" combo. The J.M. Smucker Company owns Jif too so it's no wonder the famous jelly landed on this list.

Though we're not sure what type of Smucker's product the 19.96 million Americans have in their home it's safe to say that this brand has major staying power.

The easy way to make healthier comfort foods.

Hershey's

Another brand that's more of a sweet treat than a traditional hearty peanut butter spread is Hershey's. The well-known chocolatier has a variety of candy-inspired selections including Reese's. It's the top pick for 13.44 million people which just goes to show how many chocolate lovers there are in the United States.

Planters

When the Planters name started circulating around the country people couldn't get enough of the brand's salty peanuts in the shell. As business boomed so did their product selection prompting the company to introduce peanut butter in the 1950s.

Today Planters is known for having a saltier taste than other brands which is just what 7.1 million Americans appreciate according to the survey's findings.

Smart Balance

As the only all-natural option to make the list Smart Balance came in with 5.85 million supporters. It's a solid protein choice and it tastes just as delicious as its competitors.

Whatever peanut butter brand you're loyal to you're sure to be in good company. And if you prefer a peanut butter brand that's off the beaten path that just makes your choice all the more unique.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cindric ended up second behind race-winner Jeb Burton after rain pelted the 2.66-mile superspeedway with 24 laps remaining. NASCAR called the event shortly after the brief downpour because of the time it would have taken to dry the track and the fact Talladega has no lights.

Cindric was followed in the top five by Riley Herbst in fourth and Ryan Sieg in fifth. The three Ford teams spent most of the race separated but Cindric still managed to finish fourth in stage one and third in stage two. He led four times for a race-high 24 laps and now has six top-five finishes in eight starts this season.

Herbst and Sieg finally found Cindric late in the third stage and worked their way to the front only to have the rain spoil any chance at victory for one of the three. It was Herbst’s third top 10 in the last four races while Sieg registered his first top-five of the season.

The series will take a week off before returning to action on May 8 at Darlington Raceway.

Ford Finishing Results

2nd -- Austin Cindric

4th-- Riley Herbst

5th -- Ryan Sieg

AUSTIN CINDRIC No. 22 Snap-On Ford Mustang

HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

“We obviously led a lot of laps and were just able to get hooked up with our Ford teammates there. That was the most fun I’ve had in a while and really proud of Riley and Ryan. We’ve done a lot of work over the last couple weeks after Daytona to try and get better together and that’s hard when you’re not working on the same race team so props to those guys props to Ford Performance for giving us a platform for that. Our Snap-On Tools Ford Mustang was really fast but the rain came at the wrong time -- maybe a lap too soon I don’t know. Jeb has done a good job here in the past so congrats to him. It’s always cool to get your first.”

CINDRIC POST-RACE PRESS CONFERENCE

HOW DISAPPOINTING IS IT TO NOT BE ABLE TO RACE FOR IT AT THE END?

“We brought the same car from Daytona had the same speed and hoping to get the same result. That’s a bit disappointing but these races are so challenging especially when you have the quality cars that we do in the field. There’s a lot of guys that are maximizing being able to use teammates today and that probably bit me a few times in the stages but my Ford boys came through for me at the end which was awesome because I’ve never had the opportunity to do that in these cars Those guys pulling out of line worked with me. We worked back to the front snaked together and that was a lot of fun so that’s the biggest positive I’m taking away. We sat down. It’s three different teams and that’s pretty hard to find so I’m really proud of Riley and proud of Ryan and hope that I can repay that favor because that was big and helped us all gain spots. The One Ford mentality really pulled through today. I appreciate Ford Performance’s effort to have us be able to do that but I really wish we would have been able to get the Snap-On Tools Ford Mustang in Victory Lane. There is a part of me that felt like I could have pulled out on the back straightaway and maybe got a sidedraft but I didn’t want to leave my train hanging but if I would have done that maybe I would have won the race. Who knows? But you never know when it’s gonna rain or when there’s gonna be a caution so that’s the way it goes. Second place ain’t bad a clean race car and good points.”

DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE 22 TEAM AND PENSKE HAS THE DOMINANT SUPERSPEEDWAY PROGRAM RIGHT NOW?

“I wouldn’t go that far. We’ve come a long way from not even being able to qualify inside the top 15 to bringing cars with top five speed so I know that’s hard to believe and hard to comprehend especially when you have the support from Roush Yates but we’ve come a long way and made a lot of improvements in our cars and it’s shown and I’ve become a better plate racer because of it and between the work I do with my spotter Coleman Pressley and the prep work we do as a group before the race weekend I think it makes everything work at the highest level so I’m proud of that. I’m proud to see the fruits of that effort pay off and we’ll keep going.”

DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE THE RAIN WAS COMING AND WERE YOU SURPRISED THE RACE DIDN’T GET RESUMED?

“I do feel like it was called fairly quick but it is a pretty big racetrack and obviously they have a schedule to keep and no lights so it’s up to NASCAR. I don’t even know what time of day it is but we knew the rain was coming. We knew it was gonna be a challenge throughout the whole day. Honestly coming into this weekend I think everybody in the garage area can agree that the fact that we even got laps in today with a 100 percent chance of rain in the forecast was pretty good so glad we got the race in. I’m glad we didn’t have to stay a couple extra days and I just wish we maybe would have had a few more laps there.”

RILEY HERBST No. 98 Monster Energy Ford Mustang

“It was kind of hectic. We only have a few teammates. I honestly have no teammates so just working with the manufacturer Ford but we couldn’t find them for the whole day and then finally there at the last five or six laps we found them the 39 and the 22. It kind of sucks that we can’t race for a win here but with our last couple of finishes I’m kind of happy with a fourth-place finish. It’s bittersweet but thank you to Monster Energy Stewart-Haas Racing Ford Performance. We’re looking forward to Darlington.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2JlYWNoZ3JpdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC9zdXJmZXItYW5kLWdyYXBoaWMtYXJ0LWljb24tZGF2aWQtY2Fyc29uLWxhdW5jaGVzLWVwaWMtdGhpcnRlZW4tbGVzc29uLXNlcmllcy1uZXZlci1zbmFwLXRvLWd1aWRlcy13ZS13YW50LXlvdXItbWluZC13ZS1kb250LXdhbnQteW91ci1zb2Z0d2FyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Surfer and graphic art icon David Carson launches epic thirteen-lesson series: ""Never snap to guides! We want your ...","Добро пожаловать!

Days ago it was announced that Ukraine had been accepted as the 109th nation in the International Surfing Association certain to exacerbate already intense relations with neighboring Russia. I visited the capital Kyiv in early Spring 2014 and just stumbled across the stories I wrote for Australian fashion publication Oyster. Would you like a peek into our newest brothers and sisters? Well then you’ve come to the right place.

Dispatch I

And Ukraine International Airlines flight 0518 cracks very hard on Kiev’s runway. It seems as if the pilot forgot that it was time to land and that we are all going to die here instead of there. I am clutching the armrest tightly and my Nick Potash pinky ring is digging into my finger. It was made from an old WWII pin that reads “God Bless America.”

We bounce twice before coming to a rest and the cabin bursts into spontaneous applause. I always chuckle when the innocents applaud landings though I suppose in this corner of the world where 1 in 10 flights actually crash the applause represents genuine relief. Maybe I should join? I smile condescendingly instead at the Ukrainian woman next to me wearing a shirt that reads “FASHION ADDICT” while rubbing my finger. It really hurts.

I step off the plane after gathering my bag an almost perfect Costume National carry-all and wander through the eerily silent main terminal. No one is coming to Kiev. No one is coming to Ukraine save the entire Russian Army and their tanks and their MiGs and their heavy metal Kalashnikovs.

This whole mess started innocently enough six months ago in a large square in the center of Kiev. There protesters gathered to call on then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to accept a deal that would bring the country closer to the European Union instead of Russia. Both the EU and the Russian Federation had aid deals on the table. Debate swirls on which deal was favorable but in either case the people of Kiev and western Ukraine wanted to be European. They had been Russian long enough as a part of the Soviet Union and increasingly they wanted David Beckham’s haircut Carla Bruni’s voice Donatella Versace’s plastic surgeon.

Yanukovych though spurned the EU deal and sent the protesters mad. Hundreds of thousands of them burned tires and threw Molotov cocktails and whatever it is that mad protesters do. The state riot police fought back killing many which sent the protesters furious. More burned tires. More Molotovs. And Ukraine teetered on the brink. Eventually Yanukovych fled the government collapsed and the protesters toasted their victory. Until Russia decided enough was enough annexed a part of Ukraine known as the Crimea propped up pro-Russian militias in the east and sent their Army to the border. And Ukraine has been teetering ever since. Will it implode? Will Russia invade? Will Beckham Bruni and Donatella care?

I move through passport control and the soldier handling documents stares at me. His eyes are almost wild almost pleading almost laughing. Definitely bloodshot. It is not until later that I realize his eyes were simply telling me that out there beyond the sanctity of Boryspil International Airport the patients had taken over the asylum. That once I passed him I might get my heart eaten by fascists or Putin. But more on that later. For now he simply asks “Why are you in Ukraine?” I answer. “Because the most amazing fashion things ever must be happening in the rubble. Have you seen Mad Max?” He grunts and stamps and sends me on my way.

Clearing customs a starving cab driver grabs my arm and escorts me to his old yellow Lada babbling about Putin and Obama in Russian. I think he is saying both are bad but can’t be sure. He keeps smashing one fist into another.

We drive down a freeway that is as eerily silent as the terminal surrounded by trees and weird. A cold mist falls from the sky. And then I see my first real sign of madness. A homemade checkpoint has been erected in the right two lanes. It is not being manned by official Ukrainian army but by some ragtag bunch of mulletheads. They awkwardly wave old pistols. One is wearing a leather bandana over his mouth a U.S. WWII helmet that has been spray painted black and welding goggles.

Dispatch II

Fear and paranoia hang thick in the air like the lingering bottom notes of a Maison Martin Margiela REPLICA perfume. The little anarchist keeps looking at me looking at my passport looking at me looking at my passport looking over his shoulder to the other little anarchists occupying his tire and broken cement bunker. They all wear mixed camouflage prints definitely not standard issue. It makes sense I suppose. They are anarchists after all. Eventually he points through the taxi’s open window at my Fujifilm X-20 camera and says “Sho to?” which sounds like retarded Russian and I assume translates to “Shto eta” or “What’s that?” I tell him “Gwenyth Paltrow calls it ‘…a versatile work of art.’” He grunts and waves the taxi through.

And I was not expecting this. I was not expecting Ukraine to be in full failed state mode. My driver who is continually smashing one fist into another while saying “Obama” “Putin” and I have already been through three homemade checkpoints and have not even arrived at our destination yet.

And fear.

And paranoia.

I have been in war zones before. I have had my hearing exploded by dropping bombs been shot at chased and kidnapped. I have been to Somalia for pity’s sake and was expecting Ukraine to be a laugh. A candy coated European version of real Middle Eastern/African mayhem. But in some very serious ways it is more menacing. In my experience Caucasians even little anarchists take their due diligence seriously which means detention. I do not want to be detained here. The weather is awful and #tuberculosis is trending.

Things have been out of control like this since the protesters drove the government into hiding. Ground zero of the movement was Maidan Nexalezhnosti a large square in the center of Kiev featuring sculptured odes to Ukraine’s glorious past. Simply referred to as “Maidan” it was also ground zero for the last major uprising in Ukraine the Orange Revolution. And the last major uprising before that called “Ukraine without Kuchma.” The Orange Revolution ended well for the protesters. They overturned a fraudulent vote and ushered in their man Viktor Yushchenko though he was later poisoned by Russian agents they say. Ukraine without Kuchma ended poorly for the protesters. They all got arrested and tortured they say. How this latest uprising called Euromaidan will end is completely up in the air. It could unite Ukraine and strengthen economic ties to the west. It could effectively erase Ukraine as we know it from the face of the earth.

After two more homemade checkpoints we finally turn into a hulk knows as the Ukraine Hotel. It rests on the southeastern corner of Maidan and is a monument to mid-century Soviet modern all cement and bland and weird. I walk past its security through a metal detector and up to the main desk. The lobby is cavernous and completely empty save two beautiful women working the front desk. I ask if there is availability. They smile tired smiles and say “Yes.”

After checking in to my Soviet chic room I stand on its Soviet decaying balcony and look at the utter chaos below. It is beyond anything I imagined. Mad Max’s knees would shake. Viv Westwood would think it was too punk even in the 1970s. Flotsam and jetsam of the protest still smolder. Bunkers housing self-appointed militias waiting for the coming Russian invasion polish swords. And it feels like it is all going to come undone. Like society is finished. But I have to go and get into it even if it means #tuberculosis because the last time society was finished Viv Westwood made some fashion wow. And downtown Kiev would be the perfect place for the next SEX.

Dispatch III

Click click click. Clack. The sound of two dueling stick swords mixes with Ukrainian nationalist anthems rocking at full volume. Katniss Everdeen the real one not the one played by Jennifer Lawrence is sharpening her combat skills against a man twice her size/age in head-to-toe olive green. They circle each other slowly as a cold mist drains from heaven and click click click. Clack. Katniss wears black on black of course. The man in olive green wears a belt so high nearly to his armpits that I feel certain it is the start of a new prog never-before-seen trend. I look down at my own “belt” a Yves Saint Laurent shoelace holding a trim pair Won Hundred jeans very much below my waist and think “Touche Ukrainian comrade. Touche” before hiking them up. I will be prog too.

And I have been wandering around Maidan getting deeper and deeper into the horror for hours or maybe days. It is a maze of bunkers rubble smoke and paranoid stares. The paranoid stares carry particular gravitas because there is real fear that Russia may invade today. The eastern portion of the country you see is voting on whether to join Russia simply secede from Ukraine or stay where they are. Conventional wisdom says the ballot boxes will be stuffed in favor of secession. Eastern Ukrainians and the pro-Russian militias that have taken over some eastern towns identify with their northern neighbor far more than western Ukrainians but in reality the whole concept of “Ukraine” is murky at best.

The region has been inhabited for more than 45000 years but didn’t achieve any real prominence until settled by the Kievan Rus’ in the 800s. The very same Rus’ who gave Russia its name. Kiev Ukraine’s capital is in fact considered the “mother of Russian cities” and Ukraine is sometimes called Russia’s older brother though throughout the Middle Ages it was simply and less honorably referred to as “Little Russia.” In 1921 it was absorbed into Big Russia i.e. The Soviet Union and there it sat until 1991 when freedom presented itself in the form of massive institutional collapse.

Certainly there have been flare-ups of Ukrainian nationalism over the past 200 years yet they are not altogether consistent and are not shared by the whole population. Here though in the dead center of Maidan circa 2014 Ukrainian #nationalism is trending hard. #Ultra-Nationalism even as evidenced by the red and black flags that flutter over the bunkers. “Ultra-nationalism” is sometimes called “fascism” and Putin regularly hurls this invective toward Kiev. He says that Neo-Nazis have taken over and he should probably invade to save the world from Hitler 2.0.

And perhaps Putin is right but probably not. The Ukrainian ultra-nationalist groups such as Right Sector and Svoboda despise Russian aggression and champion a romantic version of rose-colored Ukrainian amazingness but I could not find any overtly racial overtones within their discourse. All I see is Apocalyptic Punk 2.0.

Some men run mohawks that cascade down their foreheads into Danzig devil locks. Some sport red ankle length Cossack trench coats and by red I mean eat-your-heart-out-Christian-Louboutin red. Some wear neat little Trotskyite spectacles and blue plastic bags. Some perch black Maoist caps on their wide heads. Many have mullets that are distinctly menacing and not at all ironic.

Individualism is pronounced and seemingly encouraged but Maidan’s warrior class share one thing besides a hatred of Russia and that is camouflage. Desert camo is paired with Jean Paul Gaultier undershirts and marsh camo. Digital camo is paired with neon sashes and traditional U.S. woodland camo. Four-color semi-arid camo with anti-Russian buttons and French Tiger Stripe. Mixing prints has been hip for a minute but Apocalyptic Punk 2.0 takes it to the next level. Yes when the world ends mix your camos (and add a touch of Jean Paul Gaultier). It is a bold statement with questionable practicality. The hallmark of all great fashion.

Click click click. Clack. I look down again at my freshly hiked jeans. I was minutes late on that trend but focusing on my shoes I feel semi-satisfied. They are Louis Vuitton driving moccasins featuring a black/grey urban camo. And if my jeans were Luxembourgish forest pattern I would be completely next level #prog.

Uh oh. Not much of a peek. If I recall I ran out of money as I’d been covering fashion week in Tbilisi Georgia prior and you know how fashion weeks go. I barely made it out of the country. I will now go back and surf.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC9zbmFwY2hhdC1iZWF0cy1hbmFseXN0cy1ncm93dGgtZXhwZWN0YXRpb25zLWFuZHJvaWQtYXBwLWFkZHMtMjgwLW1pbGxpb24tdXNlcnMteW95LTM2NzU2MjYuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RlY2gvc25hcGNoYXQtYmVhdHMtYW5hbHlzdHMtZ3Jvd3RoLWV4cGVjdGF0aW9ucy1hbmRyb2lkLWFwcC1hZGRzLTI4MC1taWxsaW9uLXVzZXJzLXlveS0zNjc1NjI2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapchat Beats Analyst's Growth Expectations Android App Adds 280 Million Users YoY,"Snap on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for user growth and revenue as the improved Android version of its popular messaging app Snapchat attracted more users but growth slowed within North America. Shares of Snap rose 3.5 percent in trading after the bell. Daily active users (DAUs) a metric closely watched by investors and advertisers rose 22 percent year-over-year to 280 million in the first quarter. Analysts had expected 275.3 million according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Most of the user growth continued to come from outside North America rising 57 percent from the prior-year quarter. Snap embarked on rebuilding its Android app which struggled with technical bugs back in 2018. Snapchat’s Android user base now exceeds those on Apple iOS for the first time the company said. As more people downloaded the new app outside the United States where Android phones dominate over iPhone models Snap added support for more languages and added more media content geared toward audiences in certain countries.

It launched an original show called “Phone Swap India” in March on the Discover section of Snapchat which houses original content and shows from media partners. Revenue which Snap generates mainly from advertising grew 66 percent to $770 million (roughly Rs. 5780 crores) in the quarter ended March 31 beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $743 million roughly Rs. 5580 crores). Snap has increasingly invested in augmented reality technology betting that it can help brands market products like clothes and makeup to tech-savvy young users.

In March Snap acquired Fit Analytics a tech company that helps customers virtually determine if clothing will fit. “Augmented reality remains one of our biggest opportunities as we look to the future” said Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel in prepared remarks released before an earnings call with analysts. Snap’s net loss narrowed to $286.9 million (roughly Rs. 2150 crores) or 19 cents per share from $305.9 million (roughly Rs. 2300 crores) or 21 cents per share a year earlier.

And Perrie Edwards looked incredible as she shared a sizzling swimwear snap on Friday while embracing the warmer weather in the UK.

The singer 27 took to her Instagram Story where she displayed her toned figure in a tiny tie-dye bikini.

Perrie opted for a plunging triangle top which showcased her ample assets and matching bottoms which further highlighted her taut abs.

The singer left her blonde locks loose in a relaxed hairdo she appeared to go makeup-free as she posed in her walk-in wardrobe.

Perrie captioned the photo with: 'Such a lovely day' followed by summery GIFs.

It comes after Little Mix announced the release date for their first single since the departure of their former bandmate Jesy Nelson.

'The news you've all been waiting for': Little Mix recently announced the release date for their first single since the departure of their former bandmate Jesy Nelson

The pop trio Perrie Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock discussed the release of their eagerly-awaited track Confetti on social media on Wednesday - although life as a three-piece has not sprung into action just yet.

The new single will feature American rapper Saweetie in a version which does not appear on their album as they penned online: 'The news you've all been waiting for... our brand new single Confetti featuring @saweetie is out 30/04.'

In an accompanying video Perrie 27 sat between Jade 28 and Leigh-Anne 29 as they greeted their fans: 'Hey!'

The blonde beauty was seen sporting a white tee as she continued: 'Our brand new single Confetti featuring Saweetie is out on the 30th on Friday.

Big news: The new single will feature American rapper Saweetie (pictured) - meaning the trio remain a four-piece for the latest track

She then asked her bandmates: 'Check it out. 30th of April are we in April?'.

Jade wore a tie-dye top while Leigh-Anne also dressed casual in a green T-shirt. They responded: 'Yes' in unison.

'You are going to absolutely gag you're going to love it' Perrie concluded the video.

The single marks the band's first official record since Jesy 29 announced she was leaving the group in December to focus on herself.

She revealed that she was leaving Little Mix after nine years and emotionally admitted that the pressure of being in the band for almost a decade had affected her mental health.

Her emotional statement online read: 'To all my Mixers the past nine years in Little Mix has been the most incredible time of my life.

'We have achieved things I never thought possible. From winning our first Brit Award to our sold out shows at the O2.

'Making friends and fans all over the world I can't thank you all enough from the bottom of my heart for making me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. You have always been there to support and encourage me and I will never ever forget it.

Official statement: Jesy said she was leaving Little Mix after nine years and admitted that the pressure of being in the band for almost a decade had affected her mental health

'The truth is recently being in the band has really taken a toll on my mental health. I find the constant pressure of being in a girl group and living up to expectations very hard.

'There comes a time in life when we need to reinvest in taking care of ourselves rather than focusing on making other people happy and I feel like now is the time to begin that process.

'So after much consideration and with a heavy heart I'm announcing I'm leaving Little Mix.'

The Essex native went on to express her gratitude towards her supporters and co-members as she added: 'I need to spend some time with the people I love doing things that make me happy.

'I'm ready to embark on a new chapter in my life - I'm not sure what it's going to look like right now but I hope you'll still be there to support.

'I want to say thank you to everyone involved in our journey. All the hard work and dedication that went into making us a success.

'To every single fan who came to see us in concert who listened to our songs and sung their hearts out sent me messages and supported me along the way I want you to know I love you all so much and I could never have done this without you and I appreciate it endlessly.

'Most of all I want to say thank you to Jade Perrie and Leigh-Anne for creating some of the most amazing memories I'll never forget. I hope that you'll continue to fulfil all of your dreams and keep on making music that people love. Love Jesy x.'

Last week it was reported the solo artist is now at the centre of a bidding war between record labels worth £2million as they try to sign her.

Over the past few months Jesy has dropped several hints she is secretly working on new music by sharing snippets from inside a recording studio on social media."

Fans of Southern Charm and Summer House are in for a treat as Bravo has mashed up both shows into a new spinoff they’re calling Winter House. The show will integrate cast members from each reality series for a winter special that is sure to stir things up. Following the Summer House Season 5 finale the cable network aired a sneak peek to tease viewers into what’s to come.

Who will be in the ‘Winter House’ cast?

Although several cast members have already leaked several tidbits of the special season Bravo’s first look of Winter House confirmed the personalities on the show. In the 12-second preview the cast is seen wearing Viking-like gear in a tug-of-war in the middle of a winter wonderland.

As the bells chime at the beginning of the promo viewers can hear Luke Gulbranson yell “Let’s go!” In the same shot his co-star Paige DeSorbo is seen using all her strength to win this battle.

The scene cuts to the other said of the tug-of-war where Craig Conover is seen doing the most to not lose the fight. Ciara Miller is right behind Conover doing her part in the tug.

Kyle Cooke and Amanda Batula are then seen on the other side struggling to hold on to the rope. A brief glimpse of Austen Kroll is then shown with him wearing a plaid shirt with the sleeves cut off. Lindsay Hubbard is shown next seemingly defeated as the opposite team has won.

Noticeably absent from the Summer House cast was Hannah Berner who was probably unavailable as she is one of the co-hosts of Bravo’s Chat Room. Her co-stars Carl Radke and Danielle Olivera also didn’t make it to the cast trip. From the Southern Charm side there was no sign of Kathryn Dennis Shep Rose or Madison LeCroy.

Bravo has not released the premiere date for the new series.

https://twitter.com/BravoTV/status/1385413115035242497?s=20

Is ‘Southern Charm’ coming back to Bravo in 2021?

Summer House just wrapped season 5 and Southern Charm has not started filming yet. However the reality series has gotten a lot of attention this past year thanks to the LeCroy-Alex Rodriguez rumors. The Bravo personality was accused by a fellow castmate (Conover) of having an affair with the former MLB player. LeCroy has always stated that nothing physical ever happened between her and A.Rod and she had only talked to him over the phone.

All the headlines Southern Charm generated made Rose feel nostalgic for when the show started. The OG reality star said back in March 2021 that season 8 has not been greenlit.

“I sort of missed the early days maybe I’m nostalgic about the seven of us or how many there was in the beginning when we were just a bunch of random people from Charleston. This was inconceivable back then” Rose told Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM show.

One reality TV legend not expected to appear in the next season is Kristin Cavallari despite what her friend Conover has said in the media.

“They say ‘Never say never’ but I can confidently say I’m never going to do Southern Charm” Cavallari told Us Weekly. “I love Craig I don’t know! I don’t know why he was saying that stuff.”",,,

“20 years we’ve been trying to get them into Fresno” said Patty Lackey a passenger on Southwest’s first flight from Fresno to Las Vegas.

Lackey says before this she’d rarely get to see her family in Las Vegas.

“We will now because we can fly we don’t have to drive” said Lackey.

Her son-in-law is one of the pilots on the inaugural flight into Fresno from Las Vegas.

“I am so happy today so excited for the people of Fresno” said Mayor Jerry Dyer.

Mayor Dyer says the new flights will not only increase competitiveness “It’s going to increase opportunities in terms of business opportunities for people to relocate here opportunities in terms of additional flights connecting flights to some 50+ plus airports across the United States.”

One daily flight to Denver will usually depart at 12:30 pm and three daily flights to Las Vegas will usually depart at 7 am 11:20 am and 5 pm.

“We’ve always had Fresno on our map it’s always something that we wanted to be able to do” said Adam Decaire the Vice President of Network Planning at Southwest Airlines.

And according to Mayor Dyer there could be more to come.

“I can’t wait to see additional flights being added as the demand increases” said Mayor Dyer.

Lackey says they'll be booking at least five trips per year.

“We’re so so happy that Southwest is here now and we say welcome and good luck” said Lackey.

According to the airport the first flight from Fresno to Las Vegas had 118 passengers with only 25 empty seats.

Airlines are on the road back to normal and the travel landscape this year is already proving to be a world away from last year during the pandemic's peak.

Air traveler numbers in the US have skyrocketed to over one million passengers per day since March 11 according to the Transportation Security Administration and more Americans will undoubtedly resume flying once they receive their vaccines now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given the green light.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Flying now in many ways is just like it was before the pandemic. Masks are now mandated by federal law but most airlines that blocked middle seats in 2020 have no abandoned the practice while many are restoring amenities like the in-flight snack and drink service.

The summer of vaccinated travel is approaching and those expecting empty flights are going to be disappointed. Crowded flights are common and not all airlines are taking the same measures to keep flyers safe and healthy.

On recent trips in the first quarter of 2021 I set out to fly on as many different US airlines as possible to see how each was adapting to the extended duration of the pandemic.

From ultra-low-cost carriers to the largest airline in the US here's how each ranked in the new year.

7. Frontier Airlines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

Frontier is not blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights. Passengers that don't choose to pay for a seat have one randomly assigned and the airline doesn't appear to be prioritizing spacing.

I was assigned a seat in a crowded row for example when empty rows were available and many took it upon themselves to move rows.

Customer service agents at the airport may allow a free seat change but that all depends on the flight and the agent. Flight attendants aboard the aircraft also may allow a seat change but some prefer to wait until the aircraft is airborne.

Boarding

Frontier boards aircraft from the back to the front in an effort to ensure flyers in the back don't have to walk through a crowded plane. Passengers also must submit to a temperature check before stepping on the plane.

Onboard the aircraft

Mask-wearing policies were enforced but many passengers consistently disregarded the rule on a flight I took from Las Vegas to Seattle.

Frontier also does not offer an in-flight snack and beverage service during the pandemic. Bottles of water are available for purchase however for $2.99.

Deplaning

Flight attendants reminded passengers to keep their distance while deplaning but it was ultimately up to the passengers when they got up.

6. American Airlines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

American does not block any seats onboard its aircraft and instead gives flyers an option to change off a flight if it fills up depending on availability on other flights. It's a nice gesture but I've found that this is rarely a dependable alternative since crowded flights are becoming more common and there's no guarantee an emptier flight will remain empty.

Boarding

American still uses its normal boarding procedure where passengers are assigned a group depending on their seat location. The front of the aircraft tends to fill up first forcing passengers to walk through a crowded aircraft to get to their seats.

Basic economy passengers regardless of where they are sitting board in the very last group.

American offers a small in-flight service consisting of a bottle of water sanitary wipe and snack in a sealed bag. The offering is basic but more than nothing.

Deplaning

Flight attendants asked passengers to social distance during deplaning but it went largely unheeded.

5. Southwest Airlines

Southwest no longer limits capacity onboard its aircraft and every seat can be sold. Passengers are also no longer notified of full flights Travel Weekly reported.

Boarding

Southwest has reverted to its normal boarding process where flyers are assigned a boarding group and 30 passengers board at a time. Seats in the front of the plane typically fill up first and flyers head towards empty rows in the back.

Flyers can get in a better boarding group by checking in for their flight exactly 24 hours in advance and then head straight to the back of the plane to avoid other passengers.

Onboard the aircraft

Southwest offers a snack and beverage service on flights greater than 250 miles. On offer is ice water Coke Diet Coke and 7Up in addition to snack bags.

The low-cost airline was one of the airline airlines to offer this service at the beginning of the pandemic.

Deplaning

4. Alaska Airlines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

Alaska no longer blocks middle seats after abandoning the practice in January and doesn't proactively offer flight changes for crowded flights. Middle seats are however blocked in the airline's new economy premium class that also includes complimentary alcohol and early boarding.

JetBlue abandoned back-to-front in March and now uses its normal boarding procedure where passengers are assigned a group depending on their seat location. The front of the aircraft tends to fill up first forcing passengers to walk through a crowded aircraft to get to their seats.

Some JetBlue hubs like New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport have automated boarding gates where flyers don't have to interact with a gate agent. Airports without the technology however operate in the traditional method.

Airports have also been overhauled with new safety features and reminders to social distance can be found in the jetway.

1. Delta Air Lines

Blocking middle seats or allowing free flight changes for crowded flights

Flying on Delta Air Lines during the pandemic. Thomas Pallini/Insider

Delta is the last major US airline to keep middle seats and some aisle seats blocked. The policy is slated to end on May 1 however when Delta will fill planes to capacity.

Blocking middle seats is a popular selling feature for those flying for the first time since the pandemic began and Delta kept it going the longest. I could always breathe easier when flying Delta knowing I wouldn't have a seat neighbor.

The airline has encroached on the policy however when needed to rebook passengers from canceled flights. But for the most part it was a great strategy that made flying on Delta all the better during the pandemic.

Those in Delta Comfort+ or first class also have the option of complimentary beer or wine and snack boxes are also available in premium cabins on certain flights like those between Los Angeles and New York.

I was surprised that alcohol was on offer but there were no soft drinks to be found. Delta is improving the offering however and giving passengers more snack and drink options including hot meals in first class on certain transcontinental flights.

The Winner

Delta is still the clear winner among the airlines I've flown in 2021.

The airline's middle seat blocking policy would be enough to earn the title but the airline has gone above and beyond including completely overhauling airports in its network to its new standards as I saw in New York Texas Utah and California. The measures that Delta is taking in the in-flight offering department are also a step in the right direction.

Although Delta is abandoning the seat-blocking policy in May I'm confident that the airline will maintain a dedication to safety."

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK -1.39%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Times-Mail

BEDFORD — The problem of stopped traffic on 16th Street caused by Starbucks customers waiting to access the entrance to the chain coffee shop was again discussed by the mayor and Bedford City Council last week.

Bedford Mayor Sam Craig told council members last Monday the city continues to seek a solution to the potentially dangerous problem of cars that spill onto 16th Street on a daily basis. The problem can happen anytime of the day but tends to be worse during the morning hours and weekends.

Because 16th Street is a state highway the city has engaged with the Indiana Department of Transportation to find a solution.

Craig said he discussed the problem with Lawrence County Prosecutor Sam Arp and a letter was sent to INDOT seeking its review of the problem.

Craig said INDOT has agreed to assign a traffic consultant to review the area and recommend changes. Craig has requested to be present when the consultant comes to Bedford.

Discussion of the problem has been ongoing for months. Street Commissioner Dave Flinn has consulted with INDOT and Craig and Bedford Police Department Chief Terry Moore have met with the Starbucks manager.

In the meantime INDOT plans to install “No parking” signs on 16th Street near the business to remind motorists of the need to keep traffic flowing.

Craig said to his knowledge motorists have not been cited for stopping on the street while waiting to access the business but BPD officers have asked motorists to move on.

Councilman Ryan Griffith noted the problem of stopped traffic around restaurants is not exclusive to Starbucks. He said Arby’s on 29th Street frequently has an overflow of cars waiting in the drive-through line.

Councilman Dan Bortner said most restaurants have not re-opened their dining rooms because of labor shortages forcing restaurants to shift to just drive-through business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbmV3LWFwYXJ0bWVudHMtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNvbWluZy10by1yb3Nld29vZC1kcml2ZS8xMDEtZjY0MjQ3NzItOWU4ZS00ZmU1LTg3MGYtNmVlM2E1YjY3OTM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New apartments Starbucks coming to Rosewood Drive in Columbia,"An 80-year-old church on Rosewood Drive is about to be converted into high-end apartments restaurants and retail space.

COLUMBIA S.C. — An old church in Columbia's Rosewood neighborhood will soon be home to new apartments restaurants and retail space.

News 19 learned more about the significance of the project and how it's being received in the neighborhood.

For more than 80 years a plot of land off Rosewood Drive and Sloan Street housed Rosewood Church.

In 2019 church leaders decided to downsize and moved a mile down the road.

""We immediately saw it as a downtown infill urban apartment opportunity"" said Frank Cason President of Cason Development Group.

Instead of demolishing the church developers are repurposing the existing structure converting the building into 52 high-end apartments.

""There are ceilings that go up 25 30 feet the height of the sanctuary"" said Cason. ""We'll have about 9300 square feet.""

The existing back building and newly constructed front building will house restaurants and retail space.

Starbucks for example already claimed a spot.

""I think it's the largest development to happen on Rosewood since the Publix across the street"" said Cason. ""We are big believers in a rising tide lifts all boats. We certainly hope that it generates more development and more investment activity in the area.""

Columbia City Councilman Will Brennan who represents the Rosewood community says this is the first residential development of this magnitude in this neighborhood.

""This is a good case study of a developer coming in finding a good reuse for a quality historic building adding to the demand needed for quality residential and putting properties back on the tax roll"" said Brennan. ""This is definitely the first of its kind on Rosewood.""

The new location will be a pedestrian-safe development Brennan says that will provide more options for a booming housing market.

""The demand is there. It's needed. We need young professionals. We need them here so we can attract the innovative small businesses we need to grow our little economy"" he said.

Mike Ely the Vice President of Rosewood Community Council said members are supportive of the new development.

""It's been a mixed reception for sure"" said Ely. ""I think the prevailing attitude in the neighborhood is that we like Rosewood the way it is so we are looking forward to some responsible development.""

While Ely has heard a few complaints he says he's excited about his new neighbors and welcomes this new addition to the Rosewood corridor.

""We're also excited that the former Rosewood Church was not being torn down"" said Ely. ""There's a lot of different things that could have gone there and we thought that reusing the church putting apartments inside it and building on the parking lot was a great use of that space.""

Other Rosewood residents like Dustin Whitehead are optimistic about what could come next.

""You can go to the Hangar or the Rosewood Dairy Bar and get something to eat. That's nice but I wouldn't be opposed to a few more restaurants popping up on the main drive"" said Whitehead. ""On the main drive it's already a busy road anyway. What's wrong with a couple of extra restaurants? Nothing wrong with a new apartment complex using buildings that aren't being used.""

""I'm excited to welcome something that might stimulate the economy in the area. I'm a fan"" he added.

Cason tells News 19 demolition has begun inside the old sanctuary.

Construction will likely start in the next two months and the project is expected to be complete in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMzkxNzA4L2FsbW9zdC00MC1vZi1zdGFyYnVja3MtZmFucy1iZWxpZXZlLXRoaXMtaXMtdGhlLW1vc3Qtb3ZlcnJhdGVkLWRyaW5rL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Almost 40% Of Starbucks Fans Believe This Is The Most Overrated Drink,"What can you say about the drink that's launched a million memes? Possibly that you're now embarrassed to even order one at least if you're not a blond 20-something wearing a cozy sweater and Uggs in mid-August. Nearly 40% of those answering our survey won't have this problem since they're not really fans of the PSL.

The second-most overrated drink however is something that's been long gone from the official menu and the baristas will thank you not to request one-off that oh-so-annoying ""secret menu"": the Unicorn Frappuccino. It seems 2017's over-Instagrammed viral sensation is something 25% of the people we polled are bored to bits by after all these years. Way back in 3rd place with just over 12% were those who weren't thrilled with the more recent Pistachio Latte while almost 9.5% felt the same way about the Matcha Latte. Rounding out the rear were the plain old Vanilla Frappuccino with just over 7% and the hard to spell but easy to drink Caramel Macchiato.

So what do you think did your least favorite make the list? Or do you still like all of these and you're going to keep on drinking them anyway? Nothing wrong with that you like what you like. If you're going to make your poor barista dig back into the vault to get out that Unicorn Frap recipe though you'd better leave a nice big tip",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS92aWRlby9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hpZ2gtZW5kLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMtYW5kLXN0YXJidWNrcy1jb21pbmctdG8tcm9zZXdvb2QtZHJpdmUvMTAxLWJhMWRiYWRhLThlYTktNDY0My1hNmFhLWViZmIzMTYxMjAwZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,High end apartments and Starbucks coming to Rosewood Drive,"Next up in 5

From the day the first brick was laid the St. Cloud found itself the center point of financial drama.

In the early 1880s the town of Silver Cliff was booming because of the mining business and according to records it was the third-largest city in Colorado right behind Denver and Leadville. This standing and talks of the new railroad being built in the town made Silver Cliff a contestant for the new state capital’s location.

Investors soon began to support businesses in the town wanting to stake their claim in the upcoming prosperous city; however the tides would soon turn for Silver Cliff. In 1881 Denver was voted to serve as the permanent location for the State Capital with Silver Cliff not even in the top 10 runner-ups. Cañon City came in at No. 4 right behind Colorado Springs and Pueblo.

The cost of silver dropped the next year further cementing the town’s status. Finally the railroad chose a different route not through the town which was the final nail in the coffin for Silver Cliff. The financial troubles for Silver Cliff started almost immediately as investors began to pull resulting in liens being placed against properties.

On March 6 1882 the Silver Cliff Hotel Association obtained a portion of block 7 from A.T. Harris and construction on the St. Cloud hotel began.

A year later the $30000 St. Cloud Hotel was completed. On May 24 the St. Cloud Hotel had its grand opening. Charles Aldrich the manager of the St. Cloud left no detail undone. Featuring a grand ball hallways filled with flowers music by the Pueblo Opera Band and exquisite food served to the 300 guests in attendance it was no wonder that the opening of the hotel was the finest social event in Custer County according to an article in the Roista Journal.

While the hotel had the appearance of luxury and success the financial statements showed it was in duress before it even opened.

On Oct. 7 1882 months before the hotel opened records show that J.P. DeWoody of Cañon City filed a lien against the hotel because of non-payment for the labor and materials he supplied in plastering the building. The debt according to the lien was $2090.

While DeWoody was placing a lien against the building other liens were being placed against the land that the St. Cloud sat on.

Faced with a financial mess the Silver Cliff Hotel Association transferred the land back to an investor W.D. Smith in November 1883 and in January 1884 a Fremont County Record article stated that DeWoody was now the new owner of the hotel.

DeWoody now found himself owning a hotel — without the property — and began the process of finding a new place for the St.Cloud Hotel to call home. In January 1886 he purchased lots 1-3 in block 13 (currently the 600 block on Main Street) in Cañon City and began the process of moving the hotel to its new home.

While DeWoody was securing a new lot for his Hotel in Cañon City the St. Cloud was being taxed by the city of Silver Cliff. When DeWoody and his men arrived to move the furniture from the hotel they found themselves face to face with a posse assembled by the town treasure. Because of nonpayment on taxes for the past two years the posse stood to prevent the building and its furniture from being moved until all back taxes had been paid according to a Rosita article.

The Feb. 18 1886 article goes on to state “The St.Cloud hotel will not be moved until all taxes are paid. Silver Cliff will protect the interests of Custer County in this and all other respects.”

On Feb. 27 a county judge ruled in favor of DeWoody and deconstruction on the building finally began. As the men disassembled the St Cloud the bricks were numbered and loaded into wagons for the journey to their new home in Cañon City.

DeWoody’s plans for the St.Cloud not only included using the original materials to rebuild the hotel but to also expand it making it larger and grander than it was in its previous life.

A Colorado Daily Chieftain article May 26 1896 gives an update on the hotel.

“This is a four-story building with a mansard roof built of brick with stone trimmings and is by all odds one of the handsomest hotel buildings in the state. It is 68×120 feet in size and is now enclosed and being finished as rapidly as the carpenters plasterers plumbers and painters can do It. It has an elevator and electric bell and enunciator. The rotunda will contain electric lights. There are bathrooms on every floor and in fact it contains all the modern improvements and is being finished in the finest style of modern first-class hotels.”

On July 4 1886 the St Cloud had its second grand opening. The new location boasted four floors instead of the original three and included a barroom billiard and barbershop. The first two floors were opened that summer with the remaining floors finished in 1888. Advertisements for the St. Cloud started appearing fairly regularly in newspapers in 1888 promoting the “electric lights telephone connection hot and cold baths on each floor and electric bells”. Daily rates ranged from $2 to $3 per day.

Advertisements in the early 1900s focused on the St. Cloud being a health-seekers resort as more tourists arrived in Cañon City for its popular hot springs and climate.

‘With Cañon’s increasing population the reputation it is acquiring as a health resort at all seasons it is incomparable winter climate and the many tourists that are thereby attracted there is no reason why two first-class hotels can not be run in the city to advantage” a Clipper article stated in 1901.

However the financial issues the hotel faced in Silver Cliff seemed to follow it to Cañon City and in 1892 it found itself being auctioned off at a sheriff’s sale after DeWoody defaulted on his loan. The hotel was purchased by H.L. White who owned the hotel until 1897. During White’s ownership of the hotel thousands of dollars were spent remodeling it including electric lights throughout and installing a complete sewer system.

In 1899 the hotel changed hands again a pattern that would follow for several years with each owner making repairs and remodeling different aspects of the hotel.

The first name change happened in 1909 when C.C. Denton of Salida leased the building from Andrew Shore. Denton modernized the hotel by adding a steam heat system and running water in every room. Ten private baths were added as well and the telephone system was extended to the whole building. The 75-room hotel was advertised as fireproof in local papers as well as advertising cards.

Newspaper articles during Denton’s management paint the hotel as a social hub hosting banquets weddings balls and providing a place for associations to assemble. Not only was it popular among the locals during this time but it also found itself a perfect Hollywood setting and was often used as a location for Selig Polyscope Company and the Colorado Motion Picture Company for films they produced in Cañon City.

On June 22 1914 the fireproof Hotel Denton caught on fire resulting in $10000 worth of damages. Mainly contained to the fourth floor newspaper reports state that high winds and a faulty fire nozzle prevented firefighters from being able to contain it quickly. The next year Andrew Shore hired J.E. Miller as a new manager of the hotel and to oversee renovations resulting in the hotel being renamed as Miller Hotel.

In 1918 the hotel was given once more a new name and this would one would stick for the next 69 years surviving multiple changes in ownership the new name shone brightly in the night on its new electric sign — Hotel Cañon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9jb3VudHkvMjAyMS8wNC8yNS93ZXN0LWF1Z3VzdGluZS13b21hbi1maXJzdC1jYW5kaWRhdGUtZGlzdHJpY3QtMi1jb21taXNzaW9uLXJhY2Utc3Qtam9obnMtY291bnR5LWZsb3JpZGEvNzMyNTkyNzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Augustine woman is first candidate for District 2 Commission race,"A West Augustine resident with a focus on community service is running for the District 2 seat on the County Commission in 2022.

LUCIE COUNTY — A 25-foot-long sperm whale beached itself Saturday morning on Herman's Bay Beach in southern St. Lucie County and died according to a bystander.

""I sat there for two hours and watched it die"" said Cristina Maldonado of Stuart who was conducting a beach cleanup when she was among the early morning beach visitors to come across the whale. ""It was traumatic.""

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute responded to Herman's Bay that morning. Harbor Branch referred requests for comment to NOAA but officials there did not return calls Saturday.

Maldonado said she was told the whale was a juvenile that previously had beached itself further north on the beach but had been pushed back into the water by beachgoers.

Maldonado said the whale had a rope looped around its lower jaw.

""It looked emaciated"" she said.

Herman's Bay is off State Road A1A just north of the Martin County line.

According to oceanwide-expeditions.com sperm whales will usually eat a little over 900 kilograms of food (about 2000 pounds) a day. To find their prey preferably giant squid they usually dive somewhere between 300 and 1200 meters (roughly 1000 to 4000 feet) and an average dive lasts about an hour.

The adult males are the only members of the sperm whale family that venture into the colder waters approaching the north and south poles. The pods of females and young remain in tropical and temperate zones.

Sperm whales have a life span similar to humans living about 70 years. Males do not reach their full size until they’re about 50 years old.

The 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command is U.S. Army Europe and Africa’s executive agent for all theater air and missile defense operations and force management. Since activating the battalion in 2018 5-4 ADA has played a major role in supporting Allies and partners through their involvement in various joint and multinational training exercises across the European theater.

The first battalion 5-4 ADA was activated in Germany in 2018 as an Avenger battalion and will transition to the M-SHORAD Increment 1 vehicle with a projected fielding in 2021.

The M-SHORAD (Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense) vehicle is based on an 8x8 Stryker A1 armored vehicle which is fitted with a Reconfigurable Integrated-weapons Platform (RIwP) turret armed with a launcher pod with four Stinger missiles two Longbow Hellfire missile one 30mm automatic cannon and one M240 7.62mm machine gun. The vehicle is able to detect identifies and tracks air threats with onboard sensors providing 360-degree aerial surveillance.

The M-SHORAD is also equipped with hemispheric radar (MHR) designed and manufactured by the Israeli company Rada Electronic Industries. The vehicle is equipped with four MHR radars in order to ensure continuous surveillance short-halt execution and on-the-move operation. The Stryker M-SHORAD is also equipped with an identification friend or foe (IFF) antenna an L3Harris WESCAM’s MX-GCS electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sighting to provide the commander with 360° aerial surveillance as well as target identification and detection capabilities and electronic warfare (EW) package to provide improved situational awareness.

The U.S. Army utilized a rapid prototyping strategy to accelerate the timeline for M-SHORAD initial operating capability by four years resulting in the delivery of a prototype system in approximately one year. In 2020 18 Air and Missile Defense crewmembers from 5-4 ADA were selected to undergo a 6-month initial operational assessment with the prototype systems at White Sands Missile Range New Mexico.

The Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system is primarily intended to defend maneuver forces against air threats. It also has the capability to engage a range of ground targets. The Army reportedly plans to procure 144 M-SHORAD Systems with the objective of equipping the first and second battalions with 36 systems apiece by FY2021 and a third and fourth battalion with 36 systems each by FY2022.

The U.S. Army intends to field the M-SHORAD system to four additional Air and Missile Defense battalions beginning in 2021. Future development of follow-on M-SHORAD systems will incorporate technology insertions to include directed energy and improved missiles utilizing a mix of complementary DE and kinetic interceptor systems to protect maneuver forces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYXRzbWFncy5jb20vc2hhbmdoYWkvcG9zdC8zMjY0NS9yZWdpbmEtZ2FsYW5nLWdyZWctaG9sbWFuLW9uLXRoZWlyLXNoYW5naGFpLWZhbWlseS1mYXZvcml0ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regina Galang & Greg Holman Pick Their Shanghai Family Favorites,"Filipino-American and San Francisco native Regina Galang lived and worked in Zimbabwe Tanzania the UK and Thailand before landing in China in 2007 first in Chengdu and then Shanghai. Greg Holman came to Shanghai from St. Louis Missouri for a trip to see his brother who lived there met a woman (Regina!) fell in love settled down here and married her.

Nearly 11 years later they are still here with two amazing girls born in the city – Gwynevere (8) and Mackenzie (6).

Regina consults on a range of projects for start-ups and multinationals and is currently back working with Diageo her former employer of 10 years. She also supports new businesses focused on women’s leadership and the experience economy.

Greg was born with a heart defect and had open-heart surgery at the age of four which drove him to dedicate his career to helping people have better lives. He is a med-tech veteran specializing in neurovascular care as Vice President of Japan and APAC for Stryker a USA-based medical device company.

Favorite Restaurant in Shanghai

It’s hard to pick one but we love the F&B at The Shanghai EDITION especially HIYA and Canton Disco. HIYA’s temacos are addictive. We recently discovered Ottimo and have already gone back a few times. We love the walk-in wine cellar the vibe and the food is fantastic. Other faves include High Yaki and Mercato by Jean Georges. I’d add places like SOiF Villa Le Bec and Scarpetta while Greg enjoys Cantina Agave especially on a sunny day.



When we eat with the kids our go-tos are Beef & Liberty and Hatsune. Our girls can be picky with their meals but for some reason they prefer dishes like ribs salmon sashimi and roe over spaghetti Bolognese. And of course it goes without saying that Homeslice is on our regular rotation. Senso a casual Italian restaurant just across the street is owned by a lovely couple. We can often be found enjoying their happy hour and the girls devour their pizzas.

Favorite Date Night Spot for Mom & Dad

When we met back in 2010 one of our favorite date night spots was Franck. We loved the ambiance the menu on the blackboard and their beef tartare. We stopped going for a few years. Not long ago we went back and were happy to discover that it felt unchanged. It’s not far from where we live; we can walk there eat a nice meal and drink some wine. We make sure the kids are asleep and come home to watch some Netflix. We also like Polux – their generous wine pours are also awesome!

Favorite Family Activity in Shanghai

We enjoy exploring our neighborhood. We have our set circuit: coffee from Gentle Maker croissants and cinnamon rolls from MBD and the sea salt bread from Sunflour. Along the way we duck into various shops for things like a box of Honey Nut Cheerios bacon from Swiss Butchery and boxes of overpriced mac & cheese from Laura’s.

We almost always run into friends; it’s like living on a university campus with the various compounds feeling like different dormitories. We love that even in a megacity like Shanghai it can still feel like a small town.

During quarantine Greg suggested ‘Family Date Night.’ Since we couldn’t leave our apartment we dressed up and ordered the popular combo of Hakkasan and McDonald’s. We lit candles set the table dimmed the lights and just loved being together. We’ve continued the tradition since.

Other spots we like to frequent are Jump 360 the movie theatre at IAPM and Z&B – we do loads of fitness classes there for both ourselves and the kids.

Latest Family Activity Discovery

Monopoly Deal! It’s the card game version of Monopoly. It’s so much fun and doesn’t take hours to finish. We recently discovered that our six year old might be a real estate mogul! And of course it’s super easy to purchase on Taobao.

Favorite Family Movie

We have phases. For the longest time it was The Greatest Showman... until it wasn’t. Greg tried to get all of his girls into Star Wars but that didn’t go as planned. We actually love watching The Voice the singing competition. The girls are convinced they want to be on the show one day. Since we can’t hold a note to save our lives (and we passed these bad singing genes to our children) I think they’ll need to think of other dreams.

Best Addition to the Shanghai Scene in the Past Year

Klay the newly opened Indian restaurant in Jing’an is awesome and we already can’t wait to go back. We’ve tried and re-tried all of the restaurants in 20 Donghu Lu: Blaz Hundo and Cellar to Table. I love supporting my girlfriends so have to give a shout out to Gin & Juice and all of their delicious cocktails. Finally thank goodness for Charlotta Gandolfo and all of the beautiful clothes she designs.

NASHVILLE Tenn. — So far 86 major companies across the U.S. have signed a letter opposing anti-LGBTQ legislation being introduced in state legislatures across the U.S.

In the letter the businesses said they are concerned about the bills singling out LGBTQ people and that many specifically target transgender youth. They said the laws can limit access to medical care for transgender people. They can also limit parental rights social services student sports and access to public facilities.

""They seek to put the authority of state government behind discrimination and promote mistreatment of a targeted LBGTQ population"" the letter says.

Several household companies signed onto the letter including Adobe Inc. AT&T Facebook Amazon PayPal Microsoft T-Mobile and Wells Fargo.

The companies said that anti-LGBTQ bills in state legislatures can influence their business decisions as they invest and grow possibly decreasing the chances of the companies investing in some states.

Tennessee lawmakers have passed some laws during the legislative session that could influence whether the companies move to the state including a bill that prohibiting transgender student-athletes from participating in high school sports that align with their gender identity.

The Tennessee House and the Senate also passed legislation that would allow parents to opt their children out of school curriculum related to sexual orientation. This week the Senate also passed a new bathroom bill targeting transgender people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2luYmFzZS1oYWNrZWQtYWNjb3VudHMtZ2V0LW5vLWp1c3RpY2UtZnJvbS1ob3JyaWJsZS11cy1sYXdzLWZpbnRlY2gtbGF3eWVyLTExMzUyMDM0OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coinbase customers with hacked accounts get no justice from 'horrible' US laws: Fintech lawyer,"In four minutes cyber looters pilfered $34123 worth of virtual currency from a Virginia resident's Coinbase (COIN) account the 38-year-old told Yahoo Finance.

The man Ben says it’s still missing despite his appeals to Coinbase the FBI the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) lawmakers and the Better Business Bureau (BBB). In order for Ben to comply with a policy of his employer we have not used his full name to protect his anonymity.

Ben's loss is one of dozens reported over the past five years concerning breached accounts on the popular trading platform which started trading publicly on Wednesday April 14 and has become the world's most popular exchange for buying and selling digital currencies. While its popularity may make it a target Coinbase is not the only cryptocurrency trading platform with consumer accounts that have been hacked.

For its part Coinbase emphasizes the trading platform itself has never sustained a breach by hackers. Moreover Coinbase says unauthorized transactions are rare. In 2020 just 0.004% of customers experienced transactions where their email accounts were taken over SIM swaps attacks occurred on their cellphones or other personal information unrelated to Coinbase was breached according to Coinbase.

""It has become harder and harder for people to protect their online accounts given the amount of personal information that has become available to bad actors"" Coinbase chief information security officer Philip Martin acknowledged in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance.

He added ""Coinbase acknowledges that these are terrible crimes that can have a significant impact on consumers and believes more awareness and education on how to protect online accounts is critical.""

Victims knock on 'every possible door'

Still two legal experts say the U.S. legal and regulatory system does little to compel Coinbase as well as other exchanges to adopt even stronger safeguards for consumer accounts or to refund stolen account assets. These practices stem from “absolutely horrible” laws arbitration clauses and virtually zero law enforcement according to Max Dilendorf a lawyer who represents cryptocurrency investors.

“They don't work. It's just so frustrating” he said. “I see cases where people lost life savings then they knock on every possible door.""

Ben is still knocking and like many cryptocurrency investors to no avail. In an interview with Yahoo Finance he described scrambling to deactivate his account following what he thought was a typical sign-in using two-factor email authentication generated from Coinbase’s email address.

Story continues

“I watched in real time as my portfolio went down and down in value” Ben said. ""From the time I logged in to the time I deactivated it was nine minutes. And in those nine minutes there were four minutes with 18 separate transactions.”

The rapid-fire transactions in Ben's case consolidated all of his virtual currencies — including bitcoin (BTC) ethereum (ETH-USD) litecoin (LTC-USD) zcash (ZEC-USD) augur (REP-USD) stellar (XLM-USD) dai (DAI) and chainlink (LINK-USD) — into bitcoin cash (BCH-USD) then exported the funds to an external account he said.

Ben notified Coinbase which he said prompted a series of frustrating reply emails that appeared to have the hallmarks of bot rather than human communications. Then came the devastating news: Coinbase said it was unable to reverse the transactions attributed the loss to a “remote takeover” of his desktop computer and advised him to report the matter to law enforcement.

He said Coinbase’s explanation that his funds were taken during a remote takeover of his computer seem puzzling because he used two-factor authentication to access his account while running antivirus software on his desktop. Another scan immediately following the unauthorized withdrawals also uncovered no threats he said.

“I went through all of the protocols they have in place” he said.

Ben’s complaint isn’t unique. In 2018 through a FOIA request Mashable obtained 134 pages of fraud complaints ranging from wire and cryptocurrency transfers that never showed up to the inability to access locked accounts. The complaints filed by Coinbase users alerting the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight to the financial losses shared another common gripe — that Coinbase offers no way for customers to talk with a live customer service agent. Customers have continued to express concern over the level of customer service to the CFPB.

""They have absolutely zero live support in a market that is 24/7"" Ben said.

A warning to that effect on Coinbase's website is realized too late for some customers. The warning notes in bold letters ""Please be aware that we currently do not offer any phone support with a live agent.""

Dilendorf the lawyer for cryptocurrency investors described the shortcoming as unacceptable. ""A billion dollar company can can afford to have a small calling center"" he said.

Coinbase had approximately 56 million registered users as of April 15 and processed trades of approximately $335 billion per quarter according to Backlinko a company focused on SEO practices.

Unclear which regulations apply to crypto

Under current laws and regulations platforms like Coinbase can afford to go only so far as the law demands Texas A&M University School of Law professor William J. Magnuson told Yahoo Finance.

""There's all these regulations governing the financial industry but most of them weren't written with the idea that digital currencies existed"" Magnuson said.

To be sure regulators have enacted some rules applicable to cryptocurrencies. Magnunson said FinCEN the CFPB the SEC the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have all asserted some level of authority over crypto assets and states have additional regulations requiring platforms to obtain a license.

FinCEN for example requires cryptocurrency ecosystems to comply with anti-money-laundering and Know-Your-Customer rules for ""money services businesses"" under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). However Magnuson said the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions can undermine the regulations' effectiveness to address stolen funds. Platforms are technically compliant so long as they know the identity of their own customer but they're not required to know where funds end up in the event of a breach.

Candice Basso of FinCEN's office of strategic communications described the agency as a global leader in both regulating convertible virtual currency (CVC) activity and taking action against its illicit use. In October Basso said FinCEN assessed a $60 million civil money penalty against the founder and administrator of a convertible virtual currency ""mixer.""

Still Magnuson said another example of why today's regulations don't fully address consumers targeted with fraud is that it's unclear whether certain rules apply to crypto assets. Federal Regulation E he explained requires traditional banks to refund money taken via unauthorized transactions — but it's not clear whether that applies to crypto transactions.

""The rights available to crypto consumers is not the same as to people with banks"" Magnuson said which puts people who don't read the fine print at a disadvantage. ""In their terms of service they explicitly say we have no responsibility to you if you have a loss that was due to a compromise of your login credentials.""

Crypto consumer rights unlike bank consumer rights

Brooklyn resident Michael Pierre tested the requirements in a lawsuit against Coinbase filed in January. According to his complaint Pierre lost his life savings worth $400000 in cryptocurrency at the time of the filing as the result of a Coinbase account hack. He accused the company of employing inadequate security measures in violation of anti-money-laundering and the Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and ignoring a duty to investigate suspicious activities under state and federal rules.

According to Pierre despite his use of Duo's two-factor authentication Coinbase permitted three fraudulent password reset requests from a foreign web-enabled device with an IP address Pierre had never used and allowed transfers into foreign wallets never before associated with Pierre.

The case went nowhere. In a victory for Coinbase the New York state court judge granted the company's request to remove it from the legal system based on its user agreement mandating arbitration as the forum for customer disputes.

Hacks do not appear a systematic problem

The California Department of Financial Oversight said since Jan. 1 2016 it had received 106 reports from Coinbase customers complaining of unauthorized transactions. The agency received 829 such reports concerning Square and Square's Cash App 56 for Venmo 12 for Google Pay 3 for Apple Pay and 0 for Zelle which is operated by a consortium of traditional banks.

CFPB records show 3814 complaints concerning Coinbase since 2016 with the majority involving money transfer virtual currency or money service issues.

The SEC declined to comment on the number of reports of unauthorized transactions it has received over the past five years.

App security expert and Denim Group Chief Technology Officer Dan Cornell told Yahoo Finance that Coinbase account breaches do not appear to be a systemic problem. Still he said more detail from Coinbase and other payment platforms could help ensure they become less frequent.

“It seems like there would be a lot more transparency about the mechanics of these attacks. That would be helpful in understanding the risk associated with them” Cornell said. “Is this a technical flaw in payment platforms...or is this a more human factor?”

Coinbase does offer physical USB security key capability for added account security but the measure requires users to acquire additional hardware. Security experts say physical USB security keys would protect users from becoming victims of account hacks that occur through SIM swaps which are occurring with increasing frequency.

""Coinbase performs a lot of work on its back end systems in order to detect SIM swaps that occur in close proximity to account login attempts although not all mobile carriers provide access to this data"" Martin the Coinbase CTO said. In addition he said Coinbase analyzes and evaluates risk levels for outbound transactions — sometimes delaying a transaction and requiring additional security measures such as an account-holder's upload of an ID confirmation and ""selfie.""

Coinbase also offers customers accounts with higher default security settings than the industry average with options to increase protection levels according to Martin.

Every customer is required to enroll in SMS-based 2-factor authentication on signup and it gives everyone the option to ""uplevel"" their 2-factor authenticator to TOTP or a YubiKey. When asked why the YubiKeys aren't required for all customers Martin said that the company endeavors to keep the platform available to users who can't access or afford a physical security token.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC last week that he’s open to additional regulations imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges but warned that regulation and cybersecurity presented existential threats to his industry. He said he wants platforms to be treated on a “level playing field” with traditional banks.

In December FinCEN proposed regulations that would increase record-keeping requirements for money services businesses including cryptocurrency exchanges when transactions exceed certain thresholds and involve ""unhosted wallets."" Under the proposed scheme exchanges would need to record the name and physical address for counterparties to transactions above $3000 and for more than $10000 in transactions within 24 hours.

Still customers may be wary of trading on cryptocurrency exchanges if they know adequate regulations aren't in place. Ft. Lauderdale resident Carlos Orozco 44 had his Coinbase account breached by hackers who gained access to both his email and his mobile device using a SIM card swap. Spared the loss of his account funds he said he's nonetheless nervous about trading on the platform.

""I'm so paranoid now"" Orozco said.

While Coinbase has pledged to improve on just April 14 it warned customers of support delays in a page that appears to have been taken down. ""There may be a delay in responses from Coinbase Support"" the page said later adding ""We appreciate your patience during this exciting time for the cryptoeconomy.""

In the above sentence concerning the difficulty that consumers face in protecting their accounts the word ""your"" was replaced with ""people"" to ensure that the difficulty is referenced to consumers.

Since then 2021 has been flooded with new Galaxy A phones like the slightly upgraded Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and budget-priced Galaxy A32 5G.

Now several months old the Galaxy A42 5G may not be your first choice for a cheap 5G phone. That being said it may hit that Goldilocks sweet spot with a suite of useful features and specs at an affordable cost.

Below we've broken down the Galaxy A42's specs features and price to help you decide if you want to upgrade (or downgrade) to a different Galaxy A phone or another cheap phone. We've also highlighted the differences between the US and UK models because despite having the same name they're slightly different phones.

Take a look at the best Samsung phones

Cut to the chase

What is it? Samsung's affordable mid-range 5G phone

Samsung's affordable mid-range 5G phone When did it come out? November 11 2020 so it's available now

November 11 2020 so it's available now How much does it cost? $400 / £319 / AU$600

Samsung released the Galaxy A42 5G on November 11 2020. It was the first of the AX2 phones released with it and the Galaxy A12 being the only ones to ship in 2020.

It's currently selling for $400 / £319 / AU$600 but can frequently be found on sale for cheaper. Already that's a price drop from its launch price of $450 / £349 / AU$630 though.

In the US you cannot buy the Samsung Galaxy A42 5G unlocked and you must choose Verizon as your carrier. You'll need to look at other Galaxy A phones if you specifically want another carrier like AT&T or T-Mobile.

Design and display

The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G measures 164.4 x 75.9 x 8.6mm is 193g and has a 6.6-inch display. This just loses in size to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus and Galaxy A72 but does slightly beat the other Galaxy A phones including the A52.

The Super AMOLED display is 720 x 1600 pixels making it HD+ with 266 pixels per inch and a 60Hz refresh rate; it also has a built-in fingerprint scanner with a notch at the top and a thick bezel below the screen.

For comparison the Galaxy A32 5G has the same resolution but sports an LCD screen with no built-in scanner while the Galaxy A52 5G gives you a Full HD+ bump in resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.

The Galaxy A42 5G comes in Prism Dot Black Prism Dot Grey and Prism Dot White colors. Whichever color you pick the plastic back of the phone has a holographic glossy multi-shaded pattern that's pretty unique.

The phone has no water resistance rating nor any Gorilla Glass armor so either be careful with it or upgrade to the A52 5G for more protection in both areas. What the Samsung Galaxy A42 5G does have is a 3.5mm headphone jack and expandable storage via its microSD card slot which many phone owners will appreciate.

Cameras and battery life

Samsung's lower mid-range phone unsurprisingly comes with lower mid-range cameras. If you're looking for solid battery life however you've come to the right place.

The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G has a 48MP (f/1.8) main camera and an 8MP (f/2.2) ultra-wide snapper. That's true wherever you are in the world but the rest of the camera hardware actually varies.

In the US you then get a 2MP f/2.4 depth sensor and a 13MP front-facing camera. But in the UK (and seemingly most other places) you instead get a 5MP (f/2.4) macro camera a 5MP (f/2.4) depth sensor and a 20MP selfie camera.

Look into the best camera phones if you want something for serious photography; in this case its photos will be serviceable and backed by Samsung's camera AI tech but will lack the raw pixels of more expensive phones.

As for the Samsung Galaxy A42 5G's battery life it has a 5000mAh battery that Samsung claims will give you two days of 'average use'. If you're not frequently watching videos or using demanding apps this phone should last you a good while per charge. It also supports 15W fast charging but there's no wireless charging.

Performance and software

Perhaps the biggest downside to the Samsung Galaxy A42 5G is that it ships with Android 10 and One UI 2.5 out of the box. You can immediately upgrade to Android 11 / One UI 3.1 if you buy it today but this model could theoretically stop getting software updates before the other recent Galaxy A phones which launched with Android 11 out of the box.

Powered by the Snapdragon 750G and 4GB of RAM the A42 5G isn't going to dominate any benchmarks but that's still a respectable level of power for this price range. The Galaxy A52 5G for comparison has the same chipset but benefits slightly from 6GB of RAM.

If you're seeking a reliable 5G phone you'll be happy to know that the Galaxy A42 5G can use both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G networks in the US as a benefit of using Verizon's network. That gives it the best of both worlds. In the UK it only has access to sub-6GHz but then that's all the UK's networks offer.

The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G also has 128GB of storage and as mentioned above there's a microSD card slot for if you need more space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvT25lUGx1cy05LVByby12cy1pUGhvbmUtMTItUHJvLU1heF9pZDUwMDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"OnePlus 9 Pro vs iPhone 12 Pro Max: has OnePlus made the ultimate ""flagship killer""?","Hint : one of these phones comes with a charger in the box ;)

While both the OnePlus 9 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max have the same size 6.7-inch screens on paper the tapered edges of the OnePlus make it actually much narrower and way more comfortable to hold while the extra width and flat sides of the iPhone make it feel too big and definitely less comfortable to hold and handle. We also appreciate that the OnePlus is an ounce lighter compared to the iPhone which weighs in at almost exactly half a pound and definitely feels on the heavy side. The two feel equally well put together and they also both have an IP68 water protection rating which we appreciate.

You get the standard toughened glass on the back here with a matte finish on the iPhone while on the OnePlus you have the silver version with a glossy finish while the green one comes with a matte texture which is a nice variety to have. We also love the gradient on the silver model that gives the OnePlus a bit of a special look while the iPhone has a more traditional and a bit less exciting single color appearance.

One cool little feature that both share (and that you don't get on phones by other brands) is the mute switch! It's a two-way button on the iPhone that toggles between sound on mode and a vibrate mode while on the OnePlus it is a 3-way button for either fully silent mode vibrate only or sound on.

And as for what's missing on both well... that's a headphone jack but that's hardly unexpected these days.

Display

With a fast 120Hz refresh rate the OnePlus has the smoother moves









Both the OnePlus 9 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max have extra large screens measuring 6.7 inches and both are of the OLED kind with rich and vibrant colors excellent viewing angles and they also get very bright outdoors. In short these are two incredibly good looking screens.





There are some differences between the two though and the biggest one is that the OnePlus supports a 120Hz fast refresh rate so scrolling on that screen appears much smoother while the iPhone runs at half that rate 60Hz.





The OnePlus screen also has the slightly higher resolution but to be honest you really have to look very up close to notice the differences and from a normal viewing distance both of them look perfectly sharp.





For screen nerds below you will find the complete specs for each of these displays:









The iPhone also retains its signature notch which houses the complex Face ID sensors and front camera while the OnePlus features a much more discrete punch hole camera on the side that doesn't obstruct your view. You get used to the notch on the iPhone in daily use but it remains an annoyance while watching videos and playing games.





We have also done our traditional suite of display measurements and you can dive in even deeper in the numbers below:









Performance

The Snapdragon 888 on the OnePlus is fast but not as fast as the Apple A14









The OnePlus 9 Pro comes equipped with the latest and most powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip while the iPhone 12 Pro Max uses Apple's home-grown A14 Bionic chip.





Both are the most powerful solutions for each platform using the most advanced 5nm manufacturing technology. Still they are not the same. In fact the cross-platform GeekBench shows a noticeable advantage for the A14:









While important for specs nerds this is probably not something that the average user should be overly concerned with as both phones will provide sufficient speed for most tasks. In fact the faster 120Hz screen refresh rate on the OnePlus might actually be the deciding factor in perceived smoothness and not the processor.





Sustained Performance in gaming









The above screenshots should be of great interest to gamers. These are the results from the 3D Mark Wildlife benchmark which unlike other gaming benchmarks that only run for a couple of minutes runs for 20 minutes straight with intense gaming to see whether the chips inside the phones will heat up and throttle after extended heavy use.





It reveals a few interesting behaviors notice how the iPhone is capable of super powerful bursts of performance but it quickly throttles to its regular working temperature after just a minute while the Snapdragon on the OnePlus kind of throttles but is then again able to bounce back to peak performance.





5G and Wi-Fi Connectivity





The big question around the OnePlus 9 Pro is whether it will be available on all US carriers or not.





Currently T-Mobile is the only carrier to offer the phone but the phone has also been certified by Verizon Wireless so you can use it on both carriers. The OnePlus 9 Pro is not certified for AT&T's 5G network meaning that if you take it to that carrier it will only work on its LTE network.





The iPhone on the other hand has the advantage of being available for all three US carriers AND supporting mmWave 5G. Is that something you should care about? If you are among the 1% that have mmWave coverage AND you really need those super fast speeds than yes but for most users this shouldn't be a deciding factor.





In terms of Wi-Fi connectivity both phones support Wi-Fi 6 but we have noticed in our usage that the OnePlus has the much longer range and stays connected in places where the iPhone drops the Wi-Fi signal. If you have a weak connection or no connection in places in your house and you cannot upgrade your Wi-Fi setup switching to the OnePlus phone might actually solve your problems.





Camera

Can a OnePlus phone match the camera quality of the iPhone?









For years the number one complaint against OnePlus is that the company just wasn't able to make a camera that would be on par with the very best. Well last year's OnePlus 8 Pro challenged that assumption it was the first truly great camera by the brand and we have high expectations for the OnePlus 9 Pro as well.





First here is a look at the camera specs on each phone:









The biggest difference might just be in how wide the main camera on the OnePlus is compared to a noticeably narrower view on the iPhone main cam. Let's take a look at some photos:





< OnePlus 9 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max >



The main difference in daytime photos comes down to colors: the OnePlus has these more neutral tones compared to a more vibrant look on the iPhone with much higher contrast. We would argue that the iPhone has a bit larger than life colors but they do ""pop"" more and usually catch the eye of the viewer .



< OnePlus 9 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max >

We would argue that the iPhone has a bit larger than life colors but they do ""pop"" more and usually catch the eye of the viewer .





When it comes to zooming the OnePlus can go up to 30X zoom while the iPhone maxes out at 12 zoom in photos. At about 3X zoom the quality is similar and the iPhone even has a bit of an advantage but long range zoom like the above 10X zoom shot is a win for the OnePlus.





< OnePlus 9 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max >

And here is a portrait photo using the wider 1X view where again the OnePlus has weirdly cut out a part of my head.









In low light the OnePlus usually captures slightly darker photos than the iPhone but they have a more authentic ""night time"" feel while the iPhone is brighter but looks a bit doctored. In low light the OnePlus usually captures slightly darker photos than the iPhone but they have a more authentic ""night time"" feel while the iPhone is brighter but looks a bit doctored.











And this above photo shows that the iPhone can sometimes get the white balance completely wrong this building definitely has white walls as you see them on the OnePlus.









OnePlus teased its new ultra-wide camera like the second coming and it certainly performs well but maybe not quite up to the incredible hype. OnePlus teased its new ultra-wide camera like the second coming and it certainly performs well but maybe not quite up to the incredible hype.





It is in low light however that we see the true power of the ultra-wide camera on the OnePlus as it can capture even better photos than rivals.









Video Recording





On the video front you can shoot up to 8K video on the OnePlus while on the iPhone you get 4K video resolution. On the other hand you can record HDR at 10-bit and 4K resolution on the iPhone while the OnePlus cannot record HDR video.





Do keep in mind that both these extras come at the expense of file size: 8K video files take up 1GB of space for just a minute of recording and lack any form of video stabilization so a gimbal is strongly recommended while 4K HDR on the iPhone also takes a bunch of space to record but at least it does support video stabilization.





At the regular non-HDR 4K30 recording option that most people would use we found that the iPhone captures a bit more in the frame with its main camera while the OnePlus crops in and when you switch to the ultra-wide camera the difference grows even more as the iPhone has the much wider field of view. Stabilization is good on both phones but if you have to be picky there is a bit of a jitter as you walk on the OnePlus while footage from the iPhone appears almost perfectly smooth. In low light the iPhone definitely had the better dynamic range and we would give it the upper hand.









Battery Life and Charging speeds









4500mAh battery for OnePlus 9 Pro vs 3687mAh battery on iPhone 12 Pro Max

OnePlus 65W fast charging vs iPhone 20W fast charge

OnePlus has fastest ever wireless charge at 50W vs 15W





Finally these two have different battery sizes. Android phones like the OnePlus 9 Pro typically come with larger batteries than iPhones and this is also true here as the 9 Pro has a 4500mAh battery significantly larger than the 3687mAh battery on the iPhone. That's a nearly 20% difference in size!





However in our daily routine we noticed the OnePlus 9 Pro draining a bit faster than the iPhone. On a typical day starting at around 8am with a fully charged phone yours truly would need to top up the OnePlus at about 8pm while the iPhone would usually last all the way until the morning or even into the next day.





That's anecdotal evidence of course but we have also run a series of battery benchmarks in identical conditions on both phones and below are the results:





Portrait mode above can be hilariously wrong on OnePlus phones and sometimes takes two or three attempts. The iPhone is by no means perfect but it usually gets it more or less right from the first go."

The next Grand Theft Auto game could unleash a huge next-gen experience that easily surpasses Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA Online. Rockstar Games has yet to announce its plans to launch GTA 6 on PS5 Xbox Series X and PC but recent reports suggest that it's a project that has been in the works for years. Red Dead Redemption 2 was Rockstar’s last major release and having launched back in 2018; it set a new bar for graphics and open-world immersion. While the story didn’t impress everyone and the multiplayer has failed to catch on the sheer beauty and complexity of its open-world won plaudits across the gaming community. And with another few years to wait the GTA 6 release date is reportedly not arriving until 2022 at the earliest. That means Rockstar Games will have had another five years free from building Red Dead Redemption 2 to bring the next Grand Theft Auto game to life. Fans recently got excited by the news that Take-Two Interactive will be part of E3 this year.

The parent company is among a number of big names that will be partnering with the digital games show this year. A message from E3 adds: “For E3 as The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) officially unveils plans for a reimagined all-virtual E3 2021 that will engage video game fans everywhere. “With early commitments from Nintendo Xbox Capcom Konami Ubisoft Take-Two Interactive Warner Bros. Games Koch Media and more to come E3 2021 will take place June 12 through June 15. “Developers will be showcasing their latest news and games directly to fans around the world. The ESA will be working with media partners globally to help amplify and make this content available to everyone for free.” Unfortunately for gamers there is no guarantee Rockstar Games will be among the studios showcasing its latest work.

Take-Two owns a number of developers and any one of them could be the focus of Take-Two’s attention at E3. So when could we start hearing more about a possible Rockstar Games surprise in 2021? Take-Two Interactive will be hosting its Q4 2021 Take-Two Interactive Earnings Conference Call next month. This will be an event where CEO Strauss Zelnick and other higher-ups will be quizzed about what is coming next. And while there is no chance of anything directly GTA 6 related being announced that doesn’t mean we won’t learn anything. Take-Two might want to indicate that the big project being announced this year and something like this could be covered. Zelnick might also be asked about E3 and the company’s plans for the event meaning we could get more hints on whether Rockstar Games will be there. The groundwork is being laid for GTA 6 to become the biggest next-gen experience yet with PS5 and Xbox Series X hoping to learn more sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tMi1jaGFuZ2UtZmFtaWx5LWFydGh1ci1kdXRjaC1taWNhaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Dead 2: The Biggest Themes of the Wild West Game,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JlZC1kZWFkLXJlZGVtcHRpb24tMi1jaGFuZ2UtZmFtaWx5LWFydGh1ci1kdXRjaC1taWNhaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvaXQtdGFrZXMtdHdvLWhhcy1zb2xkLW92ZXItb25lLW1pbGxpb24tY29waWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It Takes Two has sold over one million copies,"Co-op adventure It Takes Two has sold over one million copies.

There also is the version that’s powered by a ramjet the R-77PD. This version was seen at MAKS 2001; however it has not been seen since and development is believed to have stalled or been canceled.

The R-77 air-to-air missile which will be the primary air-to-air armament of the upcoming Su-57 has had a troubled development compared to its American counterpart the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Starting life in the 1980s as a Soviet developmental program aside the AMRAAM its testing and development dragged on due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was only adopted in 1994 two years after the AIM-120’s first operational kill during Operation Southern Watch. However recently it has seen a revival arming some Russian fighters operating over Syria. It also has seen considerable export success. Its manufacturer JSC “Tactical Missiles Corporation” is now working on an upgraded version that is to arm the Su-57 that includes a new AESA seeker a technology that has not been included on the AMRAAM (although the Japanese AAM-4B has one).

Technologically the R-77 is an active-radar homing missile meaning that the seeker itself has a small radar that sends out radar pulses to detect the target and then uses that information to home in on the target. The current R-77 and R-77-1 use mechanically directed doppler radar without AESA while rumored future variants will use AESA in which the radar beam can be electronically directed with greater precision and speed (the use of AESA does not preclude the use of mechanical direction; modern Russian radars have been seen with both). The missiles also possess inertial guidance. Aerodynamically the R-77 is distinctive among air-to-air missiles in that it uses grid (lattice) fins an innovation that greatly increases the surface area versus traditional fins. This allows the R-77 to maneuver at higher angles of attack. These fins are also foldable allowing the R-77 to be placed on internal missile bays of some aircraft. The R-77 also uses a laser proximity fuze in contrast to the AIM-120 which uses a radar proximity fuze. The laser fuze is immune to ECM by design principle; however the AIM-120’s fuze is said to be designed to be resistant to ECM as well.

So why have we seen the R-77 deployed operationally only recently despite its adoption in 1994? One of the primary reasons for this is the lack of integration onto the Russian Air Force’s primary fighter the Su-27. At the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union the primary air-superiority fighter of the Russian Air Force the Su-27S could not use the R-77. In the tactical-fighter realm only the MiG-29S (9.13) could use it and this aircraft was far more limited in radar capability relative to the Su-27S limiting its utility in air-to-air combat. (While interceptors like the MiG-31M have been seen with the R-77 these are unlikely to be used in a dogfight.) Only in 2004 did the Russian air force start modernizing its Su-27S fleet to the Su-27SM standard which could carry R-77s. The fighters seen carrying R-77s recently in Syria are Su-35S which only began deliveries in 2013. Overall this points to a lack of urgency in fielding R-77 capable aircraft until recently. Presumably this is because of the lack of real air-to-air confrontations that the Russian Air Force saw to be in its future in the 1990s and 2000s. Most of the conflicts that Russia was involved in were primarily counterinsurgency wars or against weaker powers like Georgia with limited air forces. Only recently has Russia been using its air force in a position which puts them in possible contention with countries with air forces with peer capability. In comparison the USAF saw a lot of air-to-air action during the AMRAAM’s initial fielding period in the Middle East and Balkans.

Even then the original R-77 was not really produced in large numbers. Fewer than three hundred were produced after its adoption mostly used for training and testing. Only the later R-77-1 was produced in large numbers. This is the missile that has been seen mounted on Su-35S aircraft in Syria. While they were only first ordered in small numbers to arm the Su-35S in 2009 followed by a larger one in 2012. Finally a thirteen-billion-ruble order for these missiles was placed in 2015 which shows that the Russian Air Force is finally procuring these missiles in number.

Where the R-77 really was a success for Russia was on the export market. The R-77 is called the RVV-AE on the export market (all export versions of missiles produced by JSC “Tactical Missile Corporation” carry RVV designations: RVV-AE for R-77 RVV-SD for R-77-1 RVV-BD for the R-37M and RVV-MD for R-74). Many foreign operators of Su-27 and MiG-29S/MiG-35 variants most notably Su-30 operators such as India with the Su-30MKI and Algeria with the Su-30MKA have ordered RVV-AEs. While this is not as many countries as those that operate AMRAAM the cheaper cost of the RVV-AE (said to be around half that of an AMRAAM) has made it popular with countries with smaller budgets that still wanted the performance increase that the RVV-AE gives over previous R-27 semiactive radar homing missiles. The RVV-SD is also looking to be an export success as the MiG-35 and Su-35S are also being exported both of which can fire this missile. Given Indonesia’s recent selection of the Su-35S the inclusion of the RVV-SD in this contract is logical. RVV-AE has also been offered as a surface-to-air missile like SLAMRAAM but has found no customers.

So what’s next for the R-77 missile? The upcoming R-77M variant for use on the Su-57 is exciting with the possible AESA seeker and return to a traditional fin layout. There also is the version that’s powered by a ramjet the R-77PD. This version was seen at MAKS 2001; however it has not been seen since and development is believed to have stalled or been canceled. If it does make a comeback it would give the R-77 series a significant boost in range going out to possibly beyond 180 kilometers at Mach 5 compared to the Mach 4 of the AMRAAM. Murmurs in the Russian defense community have been suggesting that it might have returned to development as at a weight of around 225 kilograms it’s far lighter than the R-37M long-range missile which weighs six hundred kilograms. This would allow for it to be possibly carried in internal bays of the Su-57 due to the grid fins and smaller diameter of the missile.

Courtesy of Yuhan-Kimberly



By Kim Bo-eun



Personal care manufacturer Yuhan-Kimberly is stepping up efforts to engage customers by continuing to be a socially responsible company.



Last month it launched a campaign in which participants upload photos wearing masks. Yuhan-Kimberly decided to donate 10 masks to delivery workers and bus drivers for every participant setting aside a total of 100000 masks for that purpose.



The company said that the campaign was designed to raise awareness about the importance of wearing masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic.



Yuhan-Kimberly also hosted an event in which it donated menstrual pads after reaching its viewership target for a live session.



The company earlier pledged to donate 100000 pads if the show managed to attract 100000 viewers. More than 150000 viewers joined the show.



This pledge enabled a 250-percent increase in the sales of pads from sales generated through a live show held a month earlier.



Earlier Yuhan-Kimberly held another menstrual pad donation campaign which garnered 170000 supporters and 1098 donors.



The company has been donating 1 million pads to underprivileged women and teenagers every year since 2016. It has donated 6.17 million pads so far.



""It appears that trust has been built up between Yuhan-Kimberly and consumers as we have continued to host campaigns that seek to show our sincerity"" an official in charge of corporate social responsibility (CSR) at the company said.



""We will continue efforts to exert a good influence on society through donations to which consumers can relate.""



Yuhan-Kimberly has been leading the corporate social responsibility movement. It is known for its campaign in which it has planted and cared for 54 million trees since 1984.



The company was set up in 1970 as a joint venture between U.S.―based Kimberly-Clark and the Korean pharmaceutical firm Yuhan Corporation. Among its products are: Huggies baby diapers menstrual pads and Kleenex tissues.

Why NWSC is a target of allegations again,"KAMPALA – The National Water & Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) is once again a target of smear campaign with a regurgitated wave of allegations of impropriety at the government water utility company targeting the Managing Director Dr. Silver Mugisha.

It has now emerged that the government corporation may be a victim of it’s own success with strong performance returns a headache for some specific political players who targeted Dr. Mugisha in the aftermath of the fallout in the Bushenyi district political affairs.

Under Dr. Mugisha’s helm the NWSC’s annual turnover has in the last 7 years increased from Shs 150Bn to Ushs 460Bn; surplus before depreciation has increased from Ushs 30Bn to Ushs 103Bn; the number of customer connections from 270000 to 780000 and the pipe network length from 6500kms to 20000kms countryside.

It is understood that some political heavy weights from Bushenyi the traditionally political poralised district who initially dismissed Ms Annet Mugisha’s ability to win the district woman MP seat have since decided to target her husband to dislodge him from the NWSC Managing Director’s job.

Dr. Mugisha’s wife Ms Annet Katusiime Mugisha is incoming Bushenyi Woman MP after she won the race on the ruling NRM ticket with a thumping percentage of the vote. Her campaign was opposed by a top NRM official worried of losing a stranglehold influence on affairs in the district.

However it has now emerged that political fallout from the race continues to instigate those pushing to have Dr. Mugisha clipped from the NWSC Managing Director’s chair and have combined with some elements inside the corporation unhappy with tighter controls in some departments and an upcoming restructuring of the transport and security department on the other hand.

“NWSC recently signed an MOU with the UPDF to help boost our transport and security department and despite the board approval of this arrangement there was some resistance” a top official said.

It is understood that under the arrangement the Corporation will carry out maintenance works on her own fleet a development that is expected to save a lot of funds.

“Naturally those who have been benefitting from the outsourced function are not happy” a source noted.

In another instance an audit of the recruitment processes it was found out that some cartels working with some internal NWSC staff were issuing unauthorised job offer letters a matter that was investigated and closed with tighter controls.

In a separate development the NWSC after embarking on an ambitious plan of reaching more towns in Uganda and connecting more people the top management decided to invest in ventures that only add value by getting more people connected to the grid.

“As a result ventures that did not add value have gone unfunded and some staff who were benefiting from these felt unhappy. Some even resigned and left” an official notes.

Coupled with the above it has also emerged that some unhappy prospective bidders of the various infrastructure projects at the government water utility company decided to fan allegations after failing to influence the bidding processes of some projects because they have been denied meetings with top managers including the NWSC Managing Director.

Teaming with some political elements those frustrated then have decided to instigate some staff and fan allegations of impropriety all previously investigated by different institutions including the NWSC Board and found to be without merit diversionary and in most instances instigated by political interests.

Investigations indicate that most of these allegations including suggestions of impropriety in procurement of NWSC training centres in Northern and Western Uganda and other projects are “being sponsored to serve certain political interests”.

It is also reported that some political players have been promised huge financial support in upcoming elections in a certain sporting area in Uganda. This was on condition that they help in incentivising the NWSC smear project.

Top officials have since defended Dr. Mugisha against allegations of involvement in some of the mentioned projects dismissed allegations that his private residence was constructed on the corporation’s land and also dismissed allegations that the NWSC MD had through the Bamugisha Community Welfare Ltd (BCWL) run by his wife and now NRM’s Bushenyi Woman MP-elect Annet Mugisha misused resources of the corporation to fund positive community initiatives to boost his wife’s political fortunes as it was discovered that there was no nexus between the corporation’s resources and funding of the NGO.

The allegations that the NWSC chief used his official mobile number to make huge private transactions off the corporation coffers have also since been dismissed as unfounded.

According to Mr. Sam Apedel the NWSC Senior Public Relations Manager the private mobile money transactions using a CUG number attached to the MD and publicly known were purely private and “the practice did not violate any laws of the country”.

It was also noted that for the record while the NWSC does get receivables through mobile money it doesn’t pay out through the same medium.

The NWSC has also explained that the company has never gotten COVID-19 relief funds from Government as alleged as the government has only been paying water bills owed to NWSC in accordance with Corporation’s financial procedures.

According to Senior Public Relations Manager Sam Apedel the Corporation’s Board last year received and adopted explanations in relation to all the allegations being regurgitated and the narrative targeting Dr. Mugisha’s position.

“The matters were heard to the satisfaction of the board” Mr. Apedel said on Friday.

Dr. Mugisha responding specifically about the politics that come with his wife’s involvement in elective politics said on Friday:

“Ofvourse my wife is with in her rights to run for a political office and I could not stop her”.

“However I have remained professional and I continue to focus on performing my duties in the best interests of the NWSC” Dr. Mugisha told the media from Pader on Friday where he was on a performance improvement tour of the corporation’s operations in Eastern and Northern Uganda.

Dr. Mugisha says he was fully focused on working with his team to hit the institution’s targets of “securing water for all” as tasked by the Board.

The NWSC Board recently approved the Corporate Plan 2021-2023 which has given the corporation’s management a new outlook and ambitious targets including new areas of transformation to re-engineer business.

I just got the dreaded Turtle icon followed immediately by a slew of errors stating that the ""Electrical system is unable to support all features"" and ""Vehicle may not restart"". Battery showing 54%. Just drove 5 miles to Home Depot and back to my house when I started seeing the warnings. I also saw a red text error on the bottom of my screen that stated ""LOW VOLTAGE ENERGY REMAINING = 37%"". I assume this is the voltage for the 12v? Anyway as i was on the phone with Tesla they encouraged me to drive it to the nearest service dealership. I didn't feel comfortable with that decision as I started to notice that the warning voltage percentage was decreasing pretty rapidly. Turns out it was decreasing a % point every minute while just sitting in my garage. At about 17% I was not longer able to turn on the car or move to Neutral. I exited the car with about 5% left while on the phone with roadside and I am assuming that when it reached 0% I heard the car click and screen blanked out and even though the car was unlocked on the app the door handles would not work leaving me locked out of the car. The car is dead in the water (or garage in my case). So if I had followed their instructions on driving the car to the service center I am pretty sure that when that low voltage meter got to 0 my car would have locked up (on whatever highway or street I was on at the time). Tesla sent a flat bed out and they wanted to drag the car of out of the garage LOL. I'll pass on that. The tow truck driver said that he could possibly get the car powered up but not sure if it would get it powered enough to get the car into a place where it could be driven onto the flat bed. Not comfortable. I have had major issues with a towing company hauling and damaging a previous car behind a tow truck and didn't want to go through that again. I called roadside service again and we decided to have a Tesla Service person come out to my house tomorrow (this is Sunday) and take a look at this issue. I'll post some screenshots of the errors and keep you guys posted on the outcome. I hope this helps anyone else that may have this issue. I love my Tesla but major issues at 1300 miles is a big concern. And luckily I was home as I was planning on driving a 4 hour round trip to the desert tomorrow (yikes!). Thanks everyone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzUwMzM1MS9lbGVjdHJpYy1tYW4tdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwteS_SAUFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vbmV3cy81MDMzNTEvZWxlY3RyaWMtbWFuLXRlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Electric Man Almost Approves Of Tesla Model Y Build Quality,"The Electric Man changes things up in his latest video. This time he visits a different Tesla showroom in the Toronto area for his almost weekly Tesla build quality inspection videos. If you haven't been following this Tesla YouTuber started inspecting Teslas at his local showroom a few months ago. What started as a monthly inspection has turned into a weekly one. This time around he doesn't visit his usual Tesla Ashville location instead he checks out Model Ys at Tesla Vaughn.

Unlike most of his quality check videos he is very pleased with the batch of Ys he inspects this time around. I've never seen him so excited for tight panel gaps before. The most common issue he found again was the misalignment of the passenger side rear door. It's something that seems to plague most Teslas he inspects. It's a recurring issue that can be seen in most if not all his build quality videos. I'm curious as to why that is. If anyone has any ideas please comment below.

Keep in mind that The Electric Man is a Tesla owner and is doing this to help others who are about to take delivery of a Tesla and for those who are thinking of purchasing one. Commenters on his YouTube channel are usually very nice and supportive of what he is doing. This one commenter even gave him a heads up on a new batch of Teslas arriving at Tesla Ashville:

""There is a batch coming into Oakville somewhere between Sunday and Wednesday with 175XXX Vins.""

Another commenter also noticed that the panel gaps in the area where the liftgate meets the body are better and mentioned something interesting about Tesla's price fluctuations and delivery time:

""The hatch panel gaps have really improved. It’s because of your QA videos that I waited to place our Model Y order. The MSRP has increased $2k since we placed our order at the end of February. They must be using a pricing algorithm similar to airlines rental car companies hotels etc. When demand increases the MSRP increases. The current delivery time has now jumped up to 7-10 weeks for the Y. It was 2-5 when we placed our order almost 2-months ago.""

That same commenter took delivery of his Telsa and noticed some issues that got resolved:

""We took delivery almost 2-weeks ago and we are loving every minute behind the wheel. On delivery we noticed the steering wheel cocked ever so slightly to the right ( 4 wheel alignment) frunk hood slightly low (adjusted bump stops) and the charging door not quite flush. My local Tesla service center had everything repaired quickly and professionally. They texted me a link for Uber credits to get home.""

He probably knew what to look out for thanks to these videos. The Electric Man promises to keep making these videos. He is of course just inspecting a small number of Teslas in Canada but it gives people a good idea of the type of exterior build quality issues Tesla vehicles could have.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8yNS9ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LWEtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy1mb3ItMjUwMDAv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9jbGVhbnRlY2huaWNhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L2hvdy10by1nZXQtYS10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLWZvci0yNTAwMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get a Tesla Model 3 for $25000 (in California),"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

Originally published on Tesla Oracle & EV Annex.

While an affordable $25000 Tesla remains a dream for some this might not be the case for some in-the-know California residents. Geography is key here. Being located properly in California (and qualifying) you can actually purchase a Model 3 for around $25000. Hey why wait for a $25000 compact Tesla in a few years when you can get a larger more luxurious Model 3 for that price right now?

Even though the federal tax credit has already been phased out for Tesla California still offers a good number of perks to significantly lower the price of a Tesla (or any other electric vehicle for that matter). These include tax credit programs and cash rebates.

There are other states (and countries) that offer some compelling incentives for transitioning to a zero emissions vehicle but California seems to have taken the lead in the United States.

When you order a Tesla Model 3 Y S or X from the state of California your purchase automatically includes a $1500 California Clean Fuel Reward deduction (see example below) — no need to apply for this grant separately.

After the recent price increase (note: the price tag is always changing at Tesla so be sure to double-check at time of purchase) the price of a Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus is now $38490 — at the time this article was originally written. After the $1500 California Clean Fuel Reward deduction the price is then reduced down to $36999.

California residents can also apply for a $5000 grant offered by the Clean Vehicle Assistance Program (CVAP). This program has eligibility criteria based on individual or family income. Reportedly approval for this grant usually takes around 2–3 months. Once you get approval you can bring the paperwork to a Tesla store for processing.

The California Clean Vehicle Assistance Program also offers a $2000 grant for the installation of charging infrastructure at your home. So this bumps up the total grant to $7000 for eligible applicants.

Bay Area residents also have another option called the Clean Cars For All program. If this grant is stacked on top of the $7000 grant noted above the maximum of a $9500 rebate can be available to a prospective (and qualified) Tesla buyer in California.

By the way there’s more! It turns out that there’s another grant named the California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP) and luckily Tesla Model Y and Model 3 both are on the eligible vehicle list. This adds another $2000 rebate if you apply online. Once approved you’ll get a check for $2000 sent to your mailbox — simple and straightforward.

The CVRP grant also offers an additional $2500 rebate for low and moderate-income households in the San Joaquin Valley and San Diego County. To be specific the California CVRP website notes “The option to get pre-approved through Rebate Now is currently available for increased rebates to low and moderate-income residents in San Diego County and the counties that make up the San Joaquin Valley who have not yet purchased or leased their vehicle.”

The following table shows a complete breakdown of these grants to help clarify.

Okay. So what if you live in California and are able to qualify for these grants? What if you’re looking at purchasing a Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus and like many you’ve got a limited budget? Let’s be honest the most you could spend is around $25000. Could this really work? Well let’s take a look below.

Above: Tesla Model 3 prices after California rebates depending on various specific counties within the state. (Source: TeslaOracle.com)

Yes it’s possible! As noted above with the (current) lowest cost totaling $25450 assuming all rebates and perks are possible in your specific situation and geography a Tesla Model 3 SR+ price becomes quite competitive with a low-priced 2021 Honda Accord. Wow. And as EV price parity occurs with gas-guzzling internal combustion engine cars Teslas (and other electric cars) will become ever-more desirable to the masses — and that’s a good thing for the transition to EVs.

Tesla analyst Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research is not impressed with Consumer Reports’ test that apparently “tricked” a Model Y into driving itself without anyone in the passenger seat.

Earlier this week Consumer Reports claims that it made a Model Y drive itself by “tricking” it with a series of weights contraptions and loopholes that everyday drivers would never use. The experiment concluded that Tesla’s self-driving systems could operate without a driver in the driver’s seat but many weren’t impressed with the study’s findings.

Now Ferragu is commenting on the CR experiment and he destroyed the testing process along with the overall results of the test.

“Consumer Report showed you can trick à tesla to self-drive without a driver. This car is dangerous! Stop selling it! I just showed you can drive an F150 with windows open a machine gun in your hands and shoot around random bullets. This car is dangerous! Stop selling it” Ferragu said in a satirical Twitter post.

Consumer Report showed you can trick à tesla to self drive without a driver. This car is dangerous! Stop selling it! I just showed you can drive an F150 with windows open a machine gun in your hands and shoot around random bullets. This car is dangerous! Stop selling it! — Pierre Ferragu (@p_ferragu) April 24 2021

While CR was attempting to prove that Tesla’s Autopilot and Full-Self Driving systems could operate without anyone specifically monitoring the wheel the experiment was unrealistic in terms of what everyday people would do. It seems that if someone wanted their car to drive itself they could make it do it but there would be a series of loopholes that the owner would have to jump through to make this happen. Ultimately any car could be subjected to a test where it makes its operation look completely unfavorable. Anything on Earth can be outsmarted but the people doing it must know that they’re attempting to do something dangerous at their own risk. It is tough to see how Tesla could be blamed or held liable for owners “tricking” the FSD sensors which monitor the driver’s hands on the steering wheel along with the weight in the seat.

Tesla has never indicated that its cars can drive themselves and Level 5 autonomy which would make a car operate without any interventions from the driver has been discussed by Elon Musk in the past. Musk said in late 2020 that he was “extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year.” He has not commented on Tesla’s potential capabilities since then.

Ferragu a notable Tesla bull is one of the most realistic analysts on Wall Street when it comes to the carmaker. While he is a Tesla owner he is also a valuable critic of the company. He is candid with his synopsis of its outlook when adjusting price targets or releasing investor notes and has dropped his price target when the automaker isn’t performing at its best. With that being said Ferragu has experienced Autopilot for himself in his own car and in February he talked about its impressive performance on a 70-mile highway drive.

Did autopilot get a material update recently? I just drove 70 miles of complex highway. Zero touch I was blown away. For the first time I thought the car behaved like a human in slip roads densifying traffic changing lanes and most importantly when facing unclear situations. — Pierre Ferragu (@p_ferragu) February 12 2021

When it comes down to it drivers ultimately hold the responsibility of using Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. Even if the system was “tricked” by Consumer Reports their testing process was questionable and it is likely that very few people would be willing to let their cars operate through a loophole especially when Tesla indicates that drivers hold the ultimate responsibility of paying attention to the road and its conditions while operating their all-electric motor vehicle.

We have lately been increasing our activities in the U.S. market and hold an important position with materials and solutions for the semiconductor industry.



Who invented it?



The telephone videogames chewing gum and cola – all these products which we are used to in our daily lives were invented or made market-ready in the land of opportunity. It’s no wonder that the world’s first computer chip the Intel 4004 first went into production there in 1971.



And this trend has continued. In particular companies from Silicon Valley which is known as the “cradle of technology” continuously churn out their technical achievements. Tech companies such as Apple Facebook Google and eBay as well as leading semiconductor manufacturers are based in the United States. Five U.S. companies including industry leader Intel rank among the top ten in the chip industry. Micron Technology Qualcomm Broadcom and Texas Instruments also rank near the top.



As I explained in my blogpost on the semiconductor market in Asia Asia-Pacific may be the world’s largest semiconductor market. However the Americas rank second. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics this region accounted for US$ 95 billion in semiconductor sales in 2020.



Semiconductors are the key to success



The semiconductor sector has been an important pillar of the U.S. industry for many years. Thanks to technologies such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and wireless networks like 5G demand for chips will remain high after seeing a dynamic acceleration during the pandemic. And politicians are also helping to support this industry. For example at the beginning of this year the U.S. government announced its intention to ensure that the United States remains an attractive production location and to make the country less dependent on imports from Asia in particular. Among other things U.S. President Joe Biden intends to pass a law to provide US$ 50 billion for the chip industry in order to in the future prevent the kinds of bottlenecks in chip production that were seen in the automotive industry at the start of the year. The industry association SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) had previously requested more government money for the U.S. semiconductor industry for this reason.



The U.S. government isn’t the sole driver moving the country forward as a semiconductor hub; companies are also getting involved. For example in November 2020 Apple revealed their own new computer chip M1 with which the tech giant will replace the Intel processors that it has been using in its products for more than two decades. The Taiwanese company TSMC intends to invest US$ 12 billion in the construction of a new chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona. Samsung is also considering investing tens of billions of U.S. dollars in the construction of a factory in Texas for the production of three-nanometer chips.



However the United States and the companies based there rely not only on investments but also on the education of highly qualified employees. Education in STEM subjects is therefore strongly promoted at U.S. universities. I would love to see Europe and Germany join the US in strongly promoting curiosity and STEM for our future generations of scientists.

Facts About Gabi Wilson Oscar Winnner,"Our editors handpick the products that we feature. We may earn commission from the links on this page.

H.E.R. has four Grammys including one for song of the year in 2020. Now the R&B songstress has earned her first Oscar after winning an Academy Award for Best Original Song in the film Judas and the Black Messiah. The ballad ""Fight for You"" was co-written and produced alongside Tiara Thomas and D'Mile.

The 23-year-old is now halfway to earning the coveted ""EGOT"" which is when an artist is awarded an Emmy Grammy Oscar and Tony.

H.E.R spent the introductory period of her career working to keep her identity under wraps. Releasing an album with just seven songs no biography and only a mysterious full-body silhouette on the cover H.E.R. had people buzzing: Who is this person? What is this music? Why won’t she show her face? But it wasn’t all just a gimmick. While she went to great lengths to remain lowkey her jig was up once Rihanna Janet Jackson Drake and Alicia Keys sang her praises.

Today H.E.R. is almost entirely shedding the secrecy though she does still gaze at her adoring fans from many a pair of stylish sunglasses (We’re not sure we’ll ever see the day that she doesn’t perform without them). It’s almost ironic actually that as her name is an acronym for ""Having Everything Revealed."" Hiding one’s identity so that her craft does the talking or in other words reveals nothing so as to reveal everything. Read on to learn more about the 22-year-old rising star poised to have a huge night at the Grammys.

She keeps a low profile.

In modes of incognito similar to the wigged Sia and the masked Pussy Riot H.E.R. would prefer to keep her identity concealed—though not for reasons like her fellow musicians (for Sia it’s to stay mysterious; for the feminist protest punk rockers it’s so they don’t get arrested). For H.E.R. she prefers anonymity to celebrity because she would rather let the music speak for itself.

With her debut album Volume 1 and the follow-up Volume 2 she teased only her silhouette on their covers. Since then her identity has been revealed. According to Billboard fans figured out who she was after digging through SoundCloud with Janet Jackson and Drake both raving about her and revealing H.E.R. identity on social media. Still she continues to flex her extensive collection of shades on and off the stage à la Sir Elton John.

H.E.R.'s real name is Gabriella Wilson.

Born Gabriella Wilson she goes by Gabi or her stage name H.E.R. An acronym that stands for Having Everything Revealed it’s an ironic moniker for someone who would rather remain unknown. But we’ll let her explain.

“I reveal who I am and my stories and my emotions and music is an outlet for me. But it’s all revealed through my music and my message. Even though I don’t show my face and I don’t tell people who I am or more about me it’s—really you get to know who I am in my music” she explained in a radio show interview.

In a 2018 interview with Interview though her true identity was neither confirmed nor denied despite the fact that there's ""little doubt"" H.E.R. and Wilson are the same person. As the magazine put it her “legion of fans” didn’t care about her real name. They only cared about her brilliant music.

She got her big break on Radio Disney’s Next Big Thing in 2009.

A child prodigy H.E.R. had been singing and performing since girlhood. Little Gabi Wilson sang in her dad’s cover band as a child and at age 10 she covered Alicia Keys’s “If I Ain’t Got You” on the Today show. When she was 12 she got her big break: She was one of five finalists in an American Idol-like radio show contest hosted by Radio Disney (she lost). The real break however came when she signed her first record deal with Sony at 14.

But she exploded onto the scene in 2018 when she was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys.

Late 2018 H.E.R. woke up to news of two Grammy noms: one for Album of the Year (for the self-titled H.E.R. Volume 1) and another for Best New Artist. Couple her top-category nominations with her cryptic seemingly overnight fame (it wasn't) and you have quite the social media maelstrom taking over internet feeds.

H.E.R.'s last album was released in 2019.

We love her for “ ” “ ” and “ ” but her upcoming album may sound a little bit different. “You never necessarily know what sound you’re going to get” she told Rolling Stone. With this album though we can expect a “more musical” EP following in the footnotes of her predecessors. “People like Quincy Jones and even Rodney Jerkins perfected their mixes and made sure each instrument was doing the right thing. They were looking for that feeling as opposed to looking for that hit” she added.

She can play five instruments.

Lizzo may be a goddess with a flute and Alicia Keys a maestro of the ivories but H.E.R. can get down with one two three four five musical instruments. A pianist drummer and masterful guitarist who can solo with the electric acoustic and bass guitar the woman can rock out. It’s not a competition of course but if we’re keeping score H.E.R.’s translucent Stratocaster is tops.

“Playing guitar is part of who I am since I was a kid. I remember watching a video of Lenny Kravitz and Prince [from the Rave Un2 the Year 2000 concert] when I was a kid. That video changed my life—it made me want to play guitar just because of how rock star it is” she said to Rolling Stone.

Prince Lauryn Hill and B.B. King are among her inspirations.

“When H.E.R. was a child she’d wake up in the morning to her dad making breakfast in the kitchen and blasting the late musician’s concert DVD on the television” WWD wrote about H.E.R.’s affinity for Prince. And fans celebrate the similarities between H.E.R.’s “Lost Souls” (off I Used to Know H.E.R.) and Lauryn Hill’s “Lost Ones.”

Further Rolling Stone got the artist talking about her blues roots. “B.B. King with literally one note on the guitar does something to everyone in the room—and that’s what I’ve been inspired by as far as playing: feeling instead of technique” she said.

She knows the secret to life. And she learned it from Alicia Keys.

Alicia Keys who hosted the 2020 Grammys gave the budding R&B icon a few words of wisdom. “Alicia Keys told me that when it comes to music all you need is three chords and the truth” H.E.R. said to Refinery29. “I think you can apply that to life too.”",,,,,,,,,

Education: BS International Affairs Western Europe US Air Force Academy

Occupation: Former Air Force Officer; Customer Experience Coordinator TJX Companies

Relevant experience: My career in the military as well as several post-military opportunities make me uniquely qualified to serve as a Trustee on the Helena School Board. I have managed and led several organizations. My working titles have included: Director of Personnel Quality Advisor Chief of Training and Flight Instructor. When my children were young I had the great privilege of working from home and volunteering my time to their schools (classroom volunteer) sporting activities (soccer coach) and throughout the Helena community. I have been on the Board of HYSA and served as a volunteer for The Helena Food Share HYSA Queen City Football Club Cathedral of St Helena and Family Promise.

What are the three key issues facing the school district?

Helena has great public schools but there is always room for improvement. One I would love to help make a positive difference in our public schools by continuing to ensure that our budget is viable for many years to come. Two we need to continue to address facilities’ needs. While we have 3 amazing new elementary schools we also have very old facilities (Helena High School) and extremely crowded schools (C R Anderson) . Three I also believe that the District would benefit by improving communication with parents students and the larger community. I want to repair the disconnect that I am seeing after the Covid-19 crisis.

How would you rate the school district’s COVID-19 response so far and what would you like to see going forward?

The school district’s response mirrors the confusing message the entire nation received last year. I fully comprehend that it has been extremely difficult for everyone. Most of us know someone who has lost a loved one. While I am not home schooling and dealing with multiple platforms my children are and have lived alone in their college dorm rooms almost every hour of every day this year. I believe that following the guidelines set forth by the CDC and the Harvard Global Health Initiative was an appropriate choice. However I also believe that the school district needs to work on improving its communication with the community. Balancing the need to keep safety first during an ongoing emergency while also meeting the crucial need of families to know when and how school will function is a difficult task and there are lessons to be learned from our response. As challenging and frightening as this year has been it has also spurred great innovation in the classroom. I believe that this summer will provide time for the board to reflect on the lessons that were learned and to conduct a post-mortem of sorts to devise strategies for future crises and to retain helpful innovations created over the last year. What I do not doubt is the intent of our educational community to rise as best as they can to meet the needs of the students regardless of the situation. Going forward I want to see the number of infections going down so that we can with innovation safely meet in community-have art shows family nights open houses sports practices and so on. The importance of our schools in connecting our communities is quite clear after this past year.

What do you hope to accomplish on the board?

I hope to accomplish the following. One I want to ensure the new superintendent has the support needed so that we can stop the negative impact of turnover from leadership change and instead focus on long term planning. Two I want to improve messaging and connection between the school district and the community. Three I will work to get the budget in line with our financial resources. Four I will connect with the state legislature about the importance and necessity of public education in order to improve public funding. Five I plan to continue addressing facilities’ needs. Finally I intend to serve as a thoughtful and unifying voice in this amazing community.",,,,,,,,,

(AP) - Hours before the crack of dawn Billy Joe Craven turns on his potter’s wheel transforming blocks of clay into commercial pottery and works of art.

Although the founder of Craven Pottery Inc. in Gillsville announced his retirement over seven years ago the 73-year-old still produces around 100 pieces a day.

“When I retired I went home and sat on the porch for a little while and realized I can’t sit on the porch” Craven said while making a large pot. “So I kept coming back. They named me ‘Boomerang.’”

This year Craven’s business turned 50 years old. It was mid-March in 1971 when his first two customers pulled up to his shop. They were Ira Goin and Elvin Owen who lived in North Carolina. Descendants of this family still buy from Craven Pottery Inc. to this day.

Marcia Craven Stamey Craven’s daughter said her father likes to say he’s been “Owen and Goin all his life.”

After his first year in business Craven said his gross sales came out at $25000 and over the years quickly grew into a multimillion dollar company that distributed all over the U.S. with partners across the globe.

“My career was blessed with a lot of good people” Craven said. “I take very little credit for what happened.”

Living in Gillsville Craven said he was exposed to the rich pottery culture of the town learning how to make his first piece when he was around 11 years old. Both Craven and his younger brother Mike are ninth generation potters with Georgia red clay running deep in their roots.

When Craven was 14 years old he went to work for the Hewell family who has a lineage of potters dating back to 1850. Craven said Harold Hewell taught him the craft of commercial pottery setting him to work for years.

“I never dreamed I’d be in the pottery business” Craven said chuckling. “The only reason I never moved was because I didn’t have enough money to get a bus ticket.”

After Craven graduated from high school and started going to college he said Hewell approached him and said he would sell him half the business if he went back to work with him.

Craven took up the man’s offer then 19 weeks later he was drafted into the U.S. Army. He served from late ’66 to late ’68 doing a tour in Vietnam.

When he returned from Vietnam he went back into business with Hewell until 1970 - the day he quit.

Craven said he was raising two kids in a 12-by-60-foot mobile home and felt like it was time to start his own pottery shop.

“It was tough starting out we didn’t have any money” he said. “I borrowed $10000 from my daddy and that was his life savings back then. And we made it somehow.”

Craven said he quickly learned that there’s three things in business that people need to have to succeed: God family and “you’ve got to give 110% of yourself to the business.”

“I got those three things mixed up sometimes but I’ve had a good life experience” he said. “I managed to build a big company.”

Craven said his younger brother Mike was the first staff he ever hired. Mike worked with him for around 30 years before opening up his own shop in 2007 which is called “Craven Family Pottery.”

Craven said Craven Pottery Inc. went from serving as a one-man operation in Gillsville to having a staff of 368 four locations and 20 connected side businesses.

He noted that his first step to becoming a pottery giant in the U.S. started with KMart. In 1975 Craven said he packed his bags and flew to the retailer’s headquarters in Michigan.

Without an appointment and wearing blue jeans he remembers strolling past men dressed in three-piece suits and asking to speak with someone who oversees the garden department.

Luckily the company gave him the right person to talk to. Walking up to the man Craven said he set a little flower pot on his desk.

“I said ‘I made that’” Craven recounted. “He turned around to the United States map and said ‘We’ve got 1600 stores. Can you service all those stores?’”

Craven replied with “No sir.”

Changing gears the man offered him another proposition - supplying 239 stores in the Southeast with pottery pieces. Craven took the offer.

“He gave me the order and I walked out of his office” Craven said. “On the airplane coming home I got to counting it up and it would take me 20 years at my current rate of production to fill that one order.”

Rounding up his friends back home Craven said he trained more staff to help supply his hefty deal.

“I never did fill the man’s orders but I stayed in touch with him and had a good relationship with him” the potter said. “He was still buying what I was making.”

During that same year Craven said he came across a broken piece of terracotta pottery and noticed its Italian origins. He added that it was “the prettiest clay” he’d ever seen.

Sure enough Craven said he went to his trailer home snatched up his Army duffel bag lifted up his mattress and grabbed a handful of cash.

“My wife said ‘Where are you going?’” Craven recounted. “I said ‘I’m going to Italy.’ She said ‘You’ve lost your mind.’”

Craven traveled to Italy and met with the manufacturers who made the piece of pottery he found and cut them a deal. The Italian company would make pottery pieces for him that he would in turn sell across the U.S.

Craven said he went back to KMart’s headquarters and told them he could now supply 1600 stores.

“He gave me one order” he said. “That put me on the map.”

In the years following Craven went on to make other international connections expanding his imported work in Thailand Taiwan Hong Kong Haiti Mexico and other countries.

Stamey his daughter said Craven didn’t just focus on producing pottery but also silk flowers wicker baskets soil furniture the oil used in cinnamon brooms and other goods.

When Craven decided to retire at 66 he said he shut down all of his businesses and international partnerships to focus on pottery production in Gillsville.

Today Stamey who manages the company’s sales said they still work with Tractor Supply Co. Walmart and wholesale clients. Craven currently operates the shop with a staff of five.

Some of their popular products include jack-o’lantern pots face jugs Rebecca pitchers and strawberry jars which are large pots used to grow strawberries.

Despite the long hours of hard labor and the perpetual moisture that causes his hands to become tender Craven said he has loved every second of his craft.

“I never did go to work a day in my life” he said. “I never have been at work because I enjoy what I do everyday to the fullest.”

When Craven can no longer turn pots Stamey said the family’s legacy will carry on through her 24-year-old niece Savannah Craven Arnold. Like Craven Stamey said Arnold has quite the potter’s gift.

“She’s amazing” Stamey said. “When she does come (to the pottery shop) she and Daddy get to work on that glaze. He’s been good medicine for her. They have a neat bond.”

Craven Pottery Inc. is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday May 8 at the shop’s headquarters on 6640 Highway 52 in Gillsville. The event is free to the public and will feature many local potters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvcGFydC1vZi1zdWdhcm1hbnMtcGxhemEtcmVvcGVucy9hcnRpY2xlX2M0MzZjZDcyLTcwYzAtNTM2My05ZGYyLWEzMDUwZWI0NTIwYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Part of Sugarman's Plaza reopens | News | thetimes-tribune.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Mike Swehla often waits with them as he takes Canadian citizens across the border.

Swehla runs Grand Forks-based S & S Taxi and his company has never been busier. Swehla and another S & S driver ferry Canadian travelers and snowbirds just across the border then turn around and come back. Both countries agreed to close the border to nonessential travel in March 2020 and have extended the travel ban multiple times since then.

It’s something they would not have done before the pandemic when Canadians could simply use their own cars to enter the United States then return home. In 30 years Swehla said he has never had to cross the border--until the pandemic put these travelers in his taxi.

“They want to come back my list is pretty heavy” Swehla told the Herald. “I go every day this week then I have Monday off.”

Business has been good for S & S a trip either to or from the border costs $200 but it has been a balancing act for the drivers as they need to pick up their regularly-scheduled clients in Grand Forks. The trip takes about two and a half hours depending on road conditions. S & S has six drivers but only two do border runs as they are familiar with the process.

“Sometimes it gets to be ‘how am I going to get back in time for all my regular time calls’ you know?” Swehla said.

And that process is unique. Usually drivers go to Grand Forks International Airport to pick up their Canadian customers. From there they head to the border and cross over 25 feet into Canada. A last-chance turnaround just before the border has been blocked off by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials making crossing over a necessity.

Once in the country the taxi stops and the passenger walks about 100 feet to the Canada Border Services Agency checkpoint. The drivers then make a U-turn on a frontage road and come straight back to the U.S. checkpoint where they are questioned by CBP officers. Once cleared they head back to Grand Forks. It’s a process they have gotten down to an “in-and-out” science and one that doesn’t require a passport.

According to CBP Chief Matt Gruenberg at the Pembina port of entry U.S. citizens returning to the country by a land crossing can do so by showing a driver’s license and birth certificate.

“You have to prove your citizenship one way or another” Gruenberg said and added he’s glad to see regular passenger vehicles instead of a long line of commercial trucks.

Reentering the country usually goes pretty smoothly Swehla said. There’s the usual questions: ‘what are you up to?’ and ‘where are you going?’ but some border officials have come to recognize Swehla and sometimes offer a “Hey how are you doing today Mike?”

For Canadian travelers returning home means having COVID-19 test results three days prior to entering the country. They take another test at the border then quarantine at home for two weeks. On Feb. 4 the Canadian government limited returning citizens to four airports: Toronto Montreal Calgary and Vancouver with a mandatory three-day stay at a hotel to monitor for COVID symptoms.

An April 10 CBC report noted the hotel stay which travelers pay for out of pocket has prompted many to fly to near-border cities where they can be driven across. The Canadian government considers travel services to be essential and there is no hotel requirement for those either walking or driving across the border which has boosted business for taxi companies in border states.

Manitobans Wayne and Colleen Deslauriers were headed back to Winnipeg on Tuesday April 13. They met Swehla at Grand Forks’ airport after driving up from Minneapolis. They were in the U.S. to visit their daughter in Atlanta who had recently had a baby. The couple said it’s “great fine” returning to Canada by taxi and they get to bypass the hotel stay and the expense of flying home.

Colleen Deslauriers who was wearing a UND Fighting Hawks sweatshirt she picked up at a gas station after forgetting her coat in Atlanta said they turned to the internet to find a way back.

“We found out about Mike on Facebook through someone who had done that” she said and added she had never heard of the Fighting Hawks and will give the shirt to her son.

The couple had friends drop off their car at the border. They can’t go home with anyone else because of quarantine restrictions. Once home they can't leave their yard she said.

And when Swehla isn’t running Canadian snowbirds to the border or arranging service for other clients around town in his Chrysler Town and Country taxi he tools around in a 68’ Camaro. He told the Herald he did the mechanical work himself and at a recent visit to the taxi company’s office popped open the hood to show off the car’s immaculate engine.

“I’m a big block guy” he said."

Andrew Trimble said he did at one point make ""enquiries"" about singing the anthem which is not traditionally sung by by players from a Protestant background before Ireland games but decided against it when he was told he would ""get a hard time"".

The song Ireland's Call is also sung before home internationals to reflect the cross-community make-up the team.

The Coleraine-born player who retired in 2017 was speaking during a discussion on a shared future in Northern Ireland on the Second Captains podcast.

Also appearing was former Armagh Gaelic footballer Oisin McConville.

Speaking about the Amhrán na bhFiann ('The Soldiers' Song') Mr Trimble said he ""never sang"" it because ""I didn't want to be different"".

""I wanted to be part of the Ireland team and contribute to that and be a part of that as anyone else. I remember I did think about it at one stage and I just bottled it.

""Maybe if people like you and I could stop bottling it maybe that might kind of change the narrative or challenge someone else.""

The two sports men also discussed the recent trouble on the streets of Belfast and said they did not believe Northern Ireland was ready for a border poll.

Mr Trimble said: ""Until we understand each other's perspectives and have more of a collective unity I just think ideology is always going to trump values and divide us further"" while Mr McConville said he did not believe ""the south have any sort of hunger for a united Ireland"".",,,,,,,,,,,,

A storm brought hail and heavy rain to Truist Park on Saturday afternoon and the probability of additional rain forced the postponement.

The game will be made up with a traditional doubleheader on Sunday. The first seven-inning game is scheduled for 1:20 p.m. The second game will begin approximately 40 minutes after the conclusion of the first game.

This is Arizona’s first game postponed by weather since May 4-5 2015 at Colorado. It ends a streak of 866 games without a weather postponement the longest active stretch in the majors.

Arizona had a game postponed against Colorado on Aug. 27 2020 in support of social justice and equality.

The Braves will start right-hander Bryse Wilson in Game 1 and left-hander Drew Smyly who had been scheduled to pitch Saturday night in the second game.

Left-hander Madison Bumgarner who had been scheduled to start on Saturday night and right-hander Zac Gallen are expected to pitch in the doubleheader for Arizona. The team did not immediately announce the order of the pitchers.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Diamondbacks: 2B Ketel Marte (hamstring) could be moving closer to his return. “It’s just a matter of him running and feeling comfortable and feeling confident in his running” manager Torey Lovullo said. OF Tim Locastro (disclocated left pinkie) will have his stitches removed on Monday and then “can jump right back into games” according to Lovullo.

Braves: RHP Chris Martin (right shoulder inflammation) is not expected to need simulated games at the team’s alternate training site. Any practice game will come with the team and manager Brian Snitker said “he shouldn’t need a whole lot if he’s healthy.”

NO QUICK RETURN FOR PACHE

OF Cristian Pache (left groin) won’t return to Atlanta with his exit from the 10-day disabled list on Saturday. Instead he was optioned to the alternate training site. The rookie was hitting only .133 in 11 games and will remain at the team’s alternate training site to work on his swing.

“There’s not a timetable on it” manager Brian Snitker said. “We’d like for him to go down and get hot. ... He was struggling mightily when he was here.”

Guillermo Heredia hitting .286 will continue to start in center field.

The Braves on Saturday reinstated Smyly (left shoulder inflammation) from the 10-day injured list and optioned infielder Sean Kazmar Jr. to the alternate training site.

UP NEXT

Wilson (1-0) will be making his second start of the season for Atlanta. Smyly had a 5.73 ERA in his first two starts. Bumgarner is 1-2 with an 8.68 ERA while Gallen has a 3.72 ERA in two starts.

Brian Snitker provided injury updates for Max Fried and Chris Martin during Saturday’s pregame media session. Fried threw a side session Friday and took part in fielding drills. He was scheduled to hit this weekend and it sounds like he could be nearing a return.

Snitker also said that he doesn’t think reliever Chris Martin will need to spend time at the alternate site before he returns from the injured list. Martin has been on the injured list for the last three weeks but could resume throwing from a mound soon. Snitker said that Martin could pitch in some sim games at Truist Park before returning.

The Braves made a couple of roster moves prior to Saturday’s scheduled game reinstating Drew Smyly from the injured list while optioning infielder Sean Kazmar to the alternate training site. The team also reinstated outfielder Cristian Pache from the injured list and optioned him to the alternate site as well. Snitker said that they want Pache to see some consistent at-bats and to get back on track before they throw him back in the fire.

Can home runs help feed the hungry? They can when Noah Charlton Tyson Frolek and Dexter Stoiber and some Saanich firefighters are at bat.

The three teens Grade 12 students at Lambrick Park Secondary School and avid baseball players started the Home Runs for the Hungry fundraiser as part of a final project for their Career and Life Connections class – a planning course students must take to graduate.

They initially hoped to raise $200 by offering to hit a home run for every dollar donated. All three play baseball – Charlton and Stoiber plan to pursue the sport at the post-secondary level – so they felt it was fitting. They quickly surpassed the initial goal when Dansko Studios and Thrifty Foods donated $250 and $200 respectively.

While brainstorming possible charities to support Charlton got the idea to team up with the Saanich Fire Department to raise money for the Mustard Seed Food Bank because his father Capt. Aaron Charlton works for the department.

Firefighter Bonnie Fiala director of the Saanich Fire Fighters’ Association charitable foundation was “super excited” to take part in the fundraiser and help the students support the local food bank – especially during a year when so many are struggling financially.

“We partner with a lot of organizations through the year” to assist various local charities – including the Mustard Seed – so this was a “good fit” she said.

The plan – devised with the help of mentor Brian Catinus firefighter and president of the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 967 – was to do the home runs with Charlton’s father and firefighter Phil Reaume in front of a large crowd at a celebratory event but with pandemic restrictions the students had to make other plans.

Instead on April 11 the five went to Victoria HarbourCats Players Club a training centre on Cook Street and spent 45 minutes collectively hitting 200 home runs while streaming live on YouTube.

As of April 16 nearly $700 had been donated – more than triple the target. Stoiber said they plan to keep the GoFundMe page open until April 23 for any final contributions before they turn the money over to the Mustard Seed.

Running a fundraiser during a pandemic and having to change plans at the last minute was “pretty difficult but it was also really fun” Charlton said. Once all the funds are in the students must present a slideshow about the project for course credit.

Columnist

Quite often these columns when dealing with the downtown mention the classic National Bank building that was located on the southwest corner of Front and Croghan streets.

That spot is now the Fremont Federal Credit Union parking lot.

It comes to mind that many readers may not remember the building. After all it’s been gone for almost 60 years.

The First National Bank of Fremont was organized in 1863 100 years before the classic building was leveled to make room for a parking lot for another bank — the Fremont Savings Bank which was located where the credit union is now.

The First National Bank of Fremont was the second national bank organized in Ohio and just the fifth national bank organized in the United States. It was organized under the National Bank Act of Congress of 1863 with Sardis Birchard as the first president.

One hundred years later Fremont Savings Bank announced that it had purchased the landmark building and two adjacent buildings to provide parking for banking customers and downtown shoppers during nonbanking hours.

According to a story in The News-Messenger “Fremont Savings Bank through its president William M. Haynes today announced that it is exercising option on downtown real estate directly east of the financial institution’s main office.”

The bank president said property being purchased included the former bank building at the corner of Front and Croghan streets the Jean Frocks building just south of the bank building on Front Street and the Persing building just west of the bank building on Croghan Street.

The Persing building housed the offices of H. A. Kuntz Insurance the only active business in the three buildings at the time.

In announcing plans to tear down the classic bank building Haynes referred to it as a one-purpose structure built for use as a financial institution and nothing else.

At the time of the announcement the Fremont Savings Bank was leasing property at the corner of Arch and Garrison streets from Bond Furniture for use as a parking lot.

The National Bank had merged with the Liberty Bank of Fremont in the late 1950s and was located in a new building at the northwest corner of State and Arch Streets.

That lot had been the home of the Fremont Opera House for years but that building which had not been used as theater for some time was torn down to make room for a building that became the home of a series of banking companies — most recently the downtown offices of the US Bank.

Plans were to have the Front and Croghan corner converted into a parking lot with spaces for 24 cars by early spring of 1964. Interestingly when the parking lot plans were announced in the newspaper it was said that the entrance would be on Croghan Street and the exit on Front Street — just the opposite of how it is now operated.

An East Coast businessman lures in more than two dozen investors with promises of lucrative profits — when in reality those profits don’t exist and he’s using money from new investors to pay back previous ones.

But in this particular case his name isn’t Bernie Madoff. It’s Ian Bick.

By 2013 Bick was an 18-year-old event promoter with multiple businesses in Danbury Connecticut. On the outside they seemed to be the successful ventures of an entrepreneurial prodigy. But behind the scenes “it was a free-for-all s**tshow” Bick says in “Generation Hustle” HBO Max’s new anthology series about the young ambitious and fraudulent.

While Bick says he wasn’t trying to run a Ponzi scheme – “I looked at it as taking one loan to pay off another loan” Bick explains in the series – the feds disagreed. In 2016 Bick was convicted of defrauding his business investors of nearly $500000.

Whether on the smaller scale like Bick’s or superlatively large like Bernie Madoff’s this kind of financial fraud is unnervingly and increasingly common. Here’s a look at eight of the most notorious Ponzi schemes in US history:

1. Charles Ponzi – $15 million

Compared to today’s notorious cons the loss associated with this scam in 1920 might seem a pittance. But in the tale of Charles Ponzi it wasn’t just the size of the swindle but the speed with which it was done. According to Smithsonian Magazine Ponzi made an estimated $15 million in eight months by convincing lenders he could make them rich with investments in international postal reply coupons. His story was so infamous that the basics of the pyramid scheme – take money from a new investor to pay back an old one – began to carry his name despite the fact that he wasn’t the first to do it.

2. Lou Pearlman – $300 million

The man behind platinum-selling boy bands ‘NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys Lou Pearlman’s legacy also includes a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition to being sued by the very boy bands he created for stealing money Pearlman swindled investors and banks out of more than $300 million on the basis of companies that only existed on paper.

In 2008 he was convicted of conspiracy and money laundering charges and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. He died at the age of 62 in 2016.

3. Gerald Payne and Greater Ministries International – $448 million

In the 1990s Gerald Payne and leadership at his Greater Ministries International Church convinced nearly 20000 investors to hand over millions in a program that claimed it could “Double Your Blessings.” The IRS began to investigate based on suspicious bank activity and by 2001 Payne was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison. At the time the IRS called it one of the biggest Ponzi schemes it had ever investigated.

4. Reed Slatkin – $593 million

Known as a co-founder of EarthLink the internet service provider that launched in the mid-90s prosecutors say Reed Slatkin’s massive Ponzi scheme began long before the company existed. In 2003 the former Santa Barbara investment manager pleaded guilty to defrauding his investors of more than $500 million across 15 years starting in 1986.

5. Scott Rothstein – $1.2 billion

It isn’t always finance types who run the biggest scams: Scott Rothstein used his Fort Lauderdale law firm to run an eye-popping $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. According to the Miami Herald Rothstein convinced his investors to buy into bogus legal settlements. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 – a term that’s held despite his attempts at reduction.

6. Tom Petters – $3.7 billion

Businessman Tom Petters was accused of stealing money from hedge funds missionaries and pastors alike according to the New York Times. Petters promised investors that by pouring money into his organization they’d fund the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit. But that’s not what happened and in 2010 Petters was sentenced to 50 years in prison. The scam is reportedly the biggest in Minnesota history.

7. R. Allen Stanford – $7 billion

Texas tycoon R. Allen Stanford masterminded a 20-year scheme via his offshore bank in Antigua cheating almost 30000 investors from more than 100 countries out of billions. The scam involved fake certificates of deposit and prosecutors accused Stanford of funneling funds into his personal interests including real estate and cricket tournaments. In 2012 Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in federal lockup.

8. Bernie Madoff – $20 billion

It’s unclear at what point Bernie Madoff began shaping the largest Ponzi scheme in history; some believe it may have extended all the way back to the 1960s. Regardless of the timeframe what is known is that he conned thousands of investors out of $20 billion in principal funds. After his arrest in 2008 he was sentenced to 150 years in prison where he died on April 14 at the age of 82.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA0LTI2L3Vicy1kZXV0c2NoZS1iYW5rLXRvLXNob3ctaWYtZXVyb3BlLWJhbmtzLW1hdGNoZWQtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UBS Deutsche Bank to Show If Europe Banks Matched Wall Street,"European lenders are about to show investors if they can ride the pandemic-induced wave of investment banking revenue that propelled U.S. peers to a record quarter.

Now one press of a button can trigger cascading rows of animated characters. Players can score bonus rounds and free plays.

In short they have become more fun — and a whole lot like slot machines. And in Minnesota slot machine gambling can happen only at tribal casinos.

""The state has a very long history with not keeping its word when it comes to agreements it makes with tribal governments"" said Rep. Zack Stephenson DFL-Coon Rapids who is pushing to return electronic pulltabs to the originally intended version of the game. ""I don't want to be a part of that long history of not keeping our word.""

The proposed changes at the Capitol have sparked an outcry from bar and restaurant owners and charities that have come to rely on the electronic pulltab revenue. They argue the state should not deal another financial blow after the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the hospitality industry.

""It's not right to change the rules of the game right now on our struggling industry and on these struggling charities. This bill is unnecessary and irrational"" the director of the Minnesota Licensed Beverage Association that represents bars and restaurants Tony Chesak wrote to legislators.

Meanwhile Minnesota Indian Gaming Association Director Andy Platto said in a statement that the association is urging legislators and the Minnesota Gambling Control Board to ensure the electronic games comply with the intent of the 2012 statute that authorized their use.

Electronic pulltabs first were authorized to pay for the U.S. Bank Stadium debt service not to help bars or charities said Sen. Tom Bakk I-Cook who also is pushing to rein in the games. He was involved in the original agreement and said the intent was never to let the games morph into slot machines.

""Unless people are careful about this the state will get sued by the tribes and we may lose the devices completely"" Bakk said in a statement.

Electronic pulltabs and electronic bingo which also would have to change under the legislative proposal are estimated to generate $1.3 billion in Minnesota in fiscal year 2021 according to a state House analysis. Local bars would receive an estimated $29 million of that through rent payments they get for allowing gambling at their establishments. About $33 million would go to charities the House estimated.

Electronic pulltabs are not as popular as their paper counterparts but revenue from the games has been growing. As of last June 1490 locations around Minnesota offered electronic pulltabs a Gambling Control Board report states.

None of the existing electronic pulltab games in the state comply with the proposed legislative change according to the Gambling Control Board. The board could not predict whether companies that provide the games would come up with new versions to comply with the proposed law.

Stephenson said he intentionally gave a long lead time to allow game developers to come up with versions that would comply. His proposal which would do away with the bells and whistles that are now ubiquitous in the electronic games does not take effect until September 2022.

He doesn't dispute that fewer people will play the less-exciting electronic version but said the state cannot estimate how much of a financial drop-off there would be.

The timing could not be worse for Colin Minehart who owns MineAgain's bar in Alden and purchased the previously closed Trumbles restaurant in Albert Lea a few weeks ago. He was hoping to add six electronic bingo stations and six pulltab games at Trumbles. He said if the games look just like the paper versions ""it loses its entertainment value.""

""It's designed to entertain your customer so they want to stay in your place and enjoy themselves"" Minehart said and the proposed change would mean lost revenue for charities and bars that ""got kicked in the shorts in 2020.""

Republican Rep. Keith Franke a bar owner from St. Paul Park said many people who would be hurt by the change do not know it is being considered and don't have a voice in the process. He urged legislators last week to slow down the decision.

Nonetheless the Minnesota House passed a wide-ranging budget bill Wednesday that included the electronic pulltab limits. Although there's widespread bipartisan support for the change the bill has stalled in the Senate. Its fate will be decided as lawmakers negotiate the state budget over the next month.

Steve McNamara head of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association which represents London's 24000 black cab drivers has asked Nigel Boardman to expand his inquiry to include Mr Cameron's 'undue influence' as Prime Minister.

Four years ago an investigation by the Daily Mail claimed Mr Cameron and the then Chancellor George Osborne told aides to lobby Boris Johnson who was London Mayor at the time against proposed curbs on Uber a smartphone app that lets users hail minicabs.

The lawyer investigating David Cameron's lobbying attempts on behalf of loans firm Greensill has been urged to widen his probe to cover the former Prime Minister's role in torpedoing proposed curbs on online taxi company Uber

Mr Johnson's planned crackdown followed fears that Uber was putting traditional taxis out of business and adding to traffic air pollution illegal parking and accidents.

In September 2015 Mr Johnson said Transport for London (TfL) was considering 25 measures including making Uber and other private hire firms wait at least five minutes between taking a booking and picking up a customer.

It was hoped this would curb the proliferation of minicabs but the Mayor and his aides began receiving angry messages from Downing Street and 'forthright texts' from Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne.

At the time Mr Cameron had close personal relationships with Rachel Whetstone Uber's then senior vice-president of policy and communications and her husband Steve Hilton who was his director of strategy from 2010 to 2012.

Daniel Korski deputy head of Cameron's policy unit led secret crisis talks between Ministers and the Mayor and his staff. In January 2016 the Mayor decided to drop almost all the curbs Uber disliked.

Mr Johnson's planned crackdown followed fears that Uber was putting traditional taxis out of business and adding to traffic air pollution illegal parking and accidents

In his letter to Mr Boardman Mr McNamara wrote: 'The unprecedented interventions… included direct text messages believed to have been sent by Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to the Mayor as well as Number 10 officials special advisers and Cabinet Ministers…dispatched to send a clear message that the proposed changes were unwelcome – even reportedly shouting at City Hall officials.'

He claimed the lobbying by Mr Cameron Mr Osborne and other No 10 officials amounted to an 'embrace of Uber' and an effort 'to protect its position in the market'.

In March 2017 Downing Street was accused of a cover-up for failing to divulge details of the lobbying operation following a Freedom of Information request. Emails between Mr Korski and the Mayor's staff were released by TfL.

The Information Commissioner's Office investigated but The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Government was cleared due to Cabinet Office rules that let officials destroy 'trivial information' including emails within three months.

Caroline Pidgeon a Liberal Democrat London Assembly member also wants the inquiry to be broadened beyond Mr Cameron's lobbying for Greensill Capital to issue Government-backed loans to firms during the pandemic. She said it had to 'address the lax lobbying culture.'

Greensill adviser Mr Cameron – who did not respond to a request to comment last night – stood to make a fortune if it floated but it collapsed in March. Uber declined to comment. A source said more than 200000 signed a petition in autumn 2015 against curbs on the firm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZ2lnLXdvcmtlcnMtZmVhci1jYXJqYWNraW5nLW90aGVyLTEwMDA1NjYzOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delivery drivers have one of the most dangerous jobs in the country. It's gotten worse.,"Just before Christmas last year Willy Solis a 42-year-old residential construction worker-turned-delivery driver was hired to take a late-night $100 bottle of cognac to an apartment complex in Denton Texas. Once Solis found the apartment he met a stocky man who gave a name that not only didn't match the ID he showed but it also wasn't the name of the person who placed the order. Confused Solis called Instacart's phone support line.

Solis said that that angered the customer and his three male friends and that they ordered him to hand over the cognac. Even though he had qualms about it Solis under the direction of the Instacart supervisor who was still on the phone gave them the bottle.

Solis sped off in his 2018 Nissan Sentra before the situation escalated. It wasn't the only recent time he had felt unsafe. Solis who has worked for DoorDash Shipt Grubhub and other gig economy companies said he also delivered to an apartment in Haltom City outside Fort Worth where a female Uber Eats driver was murdered in January.

Solis said that since then he has stopped working after 9 p.m. and has considered carrying a gun. But he fears that if he violates gig companies' rules not to carry firearms he could risk losing his job.

""I'm very fearful every time I go out"" said Solis who makes $800 to $1000 a week before expenses and taxes. ""I don't want to lose my life over a $100 bottle of cognac or a fast food order.""

Solis is one of 15 gig economy workers who spoke with NBC News and said they feared for their safety as violence against the industry has spiked during the coronavirus pandemic. Police in several major cities including Minneapolis and Washington D.C. say carjackings and car thefts particularly against gig economy drivers rose during the pandemic.

Some drivers say that despite the companies' best efforts they are changing their hours avoiding certain areas and even carrying weapons like wasp spray Mace Tasers and firearms to protect themselves.

""As the danger grows more and more that's what's pushing me more towards the possibility of doing it"" Solis said about carrying a gun.

It's a pattern that especially affects minorities working in the lower-paying jobs said Veena Dubal a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has extensively researched the taxi industry and the gig economy.

""A lot of these workers are subordinated racial minorities and they are likely to bear the brunt of physical violence because they are in public doing this kind of work"" she said.

Story continues

The problems have become widespread enough that the major tech companies have been stepping up to address them. Uber recently instituted safety measures to protect drivers including more verification requirements for people who set up accounts with gift cards or other anonymous payment systems.

DoorDash spokesperson Campbell Matthews said in an email that the company is ""deeply troubled by reports of increased crime"" and that it intends to add an ""emergency assistance button into the Dasher app to help connect Dashers to emergency services.""

In a statement Grubhub spokesperson Grant Klinzman echoed Matthews' remarks saying the safety of the company's drivers ""is our top priority"" and that the company was ""ready to support law enforcement investigations ... as they take steps to address the unacceptable spike in vehicle thefts.""

Lyft spokesperson Ashley Adams said that the company considers safety to be ""fundamental"" and that ""we are working closely with law enforcement to help keep drivers safe.""

Instacart expressed similar concerns but said it hadn't ""seen an increase in carjackings or assault towards shoppers.""

""We take the safety and security of the entire Instacart community very seriously"" Natalia Montalvo a company spokesperson said by email. ""Shoppers have many resources available to them to ensure their safety and protection while shopping and delivering on the Instacart platform.""

Rising crime

The attacks on drivers which appear to have started last year may be part of a larger trend of a rise in violent crime in major cities according to research in November by the Police Executive Research Forum.

Chicago police found that there were 424 carjackings from January through March more than double the 198 carjackings the same time last year. In San Diego carjackings more than doubled last year to 97 from 44 in 2019. In Minneapolis carjackings also more than doubled to 97 in the first three months of the year compared to 39 in the first three months of last year. In Washington carjackings more than quadrupled in the first quarter of this year from the first quarter of last year to 102.

Such growth has happened elsewhere too. In Cincinnati 38 vehicles were stolen from Jan. 1 through March 20 in the ""CUF"" neighborhood near the University of Cincinnati. Emily Szink a police spokesperson said ""many of those cars were left running and were delivery drivers"" estimating them to be two-thirds of the 38 reports or about 26.

But the spikes aren't universal: Police in Sacramento California; Phoenix; Lansing Michigan; and Dallas say they haven't seen such rises. It isn't clear why some cities are experiencing more of this type of crime than others.

Even before the rise in violent crime against gig workers being a delivery driver was identified as one of the most dangerous jobs in America — typically as a result of traffic accidents — according to an analysis last year of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries.

Last month alone several high-profile events shook the gig worker community. In New York City Francisco Villalva Vitinio a DoorDash delivery worker was killed after he refused to give up his e-bike which he needed for work to would-be robbers. Authorities said Mohammad Anwar 66 an Uber Eats driver died at the hands of two teenage girls who investigators said used a stun gun on him in Washington. Days earlier in Chicago Javier Ramos an Uber driver was shot in the head and killed; police said his killer was a passenger he had picked up after 3 a.m.

Child kidnappings

On Feb. 6 Jeffrey Fang 39 a DoorDash driver in San Francisco left his silver Honda Odyssey minivan running while he made a delivery — leaving inside his 4-year-old daughter and his 2-year-old son who speak only Mandarin. When he returned he found a strange man sitting in the driver's seat.

Fang said he dragged the man who he said snatched his cellphone out of the car and chased him on foot to get his phone back. Fang lost the man ending up a short distance away. When he returned he discovered that his minivan had been stolen with his children inside. (The children and the car were recovered hours later unharmed.)

""There are a lot of things that people need to know"" Fang said speaking of gig work in general. ""It's not simple and it's at times dangerous.""

Small-town America isn't immune. In Rapid City South Dakota a 20-year-old DoorDash driver named Danielle — whose last name is being withheld as she fears reprisal from the company — said she has felt unsafe.

Danielle's two-year-old is a passenger when she works as a DoorDash driver. (Danielle)

She said that last month when she was making a delivery with her 2-year-old son in the back five men surrounded her car. As she sped away with her son in the back ""they tried opening my car doors and banging on my windows."" The incident left her shaken and she said she is thinking about buying a handgun which she isn't legally allowed to do until her next birthday.

""I would feel a lot safer taking my son with me if I were carrying"" she said. ""In a time of need I will be able to use it and defend myself and my son.""

Deaths

Early on the morning of March 23 Javier Ramos 46 an Uber driver was found shot in the head in Chicago's Lawndale section less than 8 miles north of Midway Airport. Police rushed him to a hospital; he was pronounced dead just over four hours later.

Lenny Sanchez a longtime ride-share driver and labor organizer based in Chicago tweeted the next day that Ramos had ""tried to fight off his attackers."" Ramos appeared to have been left for dead having been run over by his own car seemingly after a struggle.

Since the beginning of the year Sanchez and the Independent Drivers Guild a union have been sounding the alarm online and at in-person rallies about carjackings of gig drivers in Chicago. He said many drivers he has talked to are scared and have changed how where and when they work. Some gig workers are considering taking stronger measures.

""Drivers are brandishing their weapons to us. A lot of them are arming themselves"" Sanchez said.

While Sanchez applauded Uber's new efforts this year to keep drivers safer and said his group is seeking additional safety measures he worried that Lyft drivers in Chicago and elsewhere face renewed threats pointing to the recent killing of a Lyft driver in St. Louis.

He said he thinks Uber's changes have had an effect. ""We know it won't be perfect but we would like to see more and we would like to see Lyft do more"" he said. ""We are seeing the criminals switch over to Lyft.""

Lyft didn't respond directly to Sanchez's claim. Adams the company spokesperson said by email that it was ""working to proactively identify"" accounts that ""we determine to be high-risk.""

""In doing so we look at a variety of account attributes including the use of anonymous payment methods which are more frequently linked to fraudulent accounts"" she wrote. ""Actions we take include temporarily and permanently deactivating accounts as well as requiring additional validation before being able to order a ride.""

Hortencia Ramos Ramos' cousin said her family has been devastated by his death particularly his 9-year-old daughter. She described Ramos as an ""entrepreneur always looking to set an example for his daughter"" an observant Christian and someone who had a daily fitness and workout routine.

She said her family has been very disappointed with how Uber has handled her cousin's death; she said no one from the company had reached out to even offer sympathy much less anything more substantive.

Jodi Kawada Page an Uber spokesperson said in a statement: ""We are deeply saddened by this news. Our thoughts are with Javier's loved ones and we've reached out to the family to offer our support.""

Law enforcement efforts

Law enforcement agencies have been stepping up. Chicago police have expanded a ""vehicular hijacking task force"" with state and federal agencies. Since the beginning of the year Chicago police have published 30 news releases describing indictments of carjacking suspects including those alleged to have targeted gig workers. The police department has even published two-page flyers in four languages — English Spanish Polish and Chinese — explaining how victims should respond to minimize harm.

Similarly the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington reported a steady increase in carjackings as well. In 2019 there were 142; last year they jumped to 345. There were 47 carjacking-related arrests in the first three months of this year compared to just two during the first quarter of last year.

Police have put out flyers alerting people to the dangers of leaving their vehicles running while making deliveries.

""Over the last few months we have worked to partner with delivery companies to get the word out to their drivers"" Kristen Metzger a police spokesperson said by email.

The early efforts by police departments seem to be resulting in change. Last month Cincinnati police even put up electronic signs to remind drivers to ""Lock Car & Take Key"" among other safety messages.

""Thefts of delivery driver vehicles left running have started to trend downwards which means our messaging is working"" Szink the police spokesperson said by email.

Longer consequences

But gig workers who have been victims may need more time before they feel safe again. Back in San Francisco Fang has been taking a break from gig work. After the harrowing kidnapping of his children supporters raised over $100000 through GoFundMe and DoorDash donated several thousand dollars to his family directly.

Jeffrey Fang (Nina Riggio / for NBC News)

Still Fang remains fearful of going back to work. During his time as an Uber driver he said guns were pointed at him multiple times. Nowadays he carries a Taser in his car.

""Prior to the Taser I had a knife in the car but that was stolen"" he said. ""Especially after the February 6 incident and the spate of anti-Asian violence I'm looking into getting a firearm.""

When the pandemic hit and passenger rides largely dried up he switched to food delivery because he thought he would make more money and it would be safer.

""I felt it was OK to take the kids even though I knew it was a risk but I had no child care and I felt the risk was minimized"" he said adding that he tried to stick to wealthy neighborhoods. His car and his children were taken in Pacific Heights one of San Francisco's richest areas.

Jeffrey Fang (Nina Riggio / Nina Riggio for NBC News)

Fang said he would like DoorDash's and other companies' leaders to consider the needs of working parents particularly those who feel the need to drive at peak evening dinner hours.

""If they're getting paid six figures with ergonomic furniture and break rooms and all that — if you ask me how about setting up child care service for dinner hours like 4 to 10 p.m.?"" he said. ""So the driver can drop them off? For a billion-dollar company that shouldn't be too costly.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1hem9uLWV4ZWNzLWxlYXZpbmctZHJvdmVzLWNsb3Vka2l0Y2hlbnMtdWJlci1jYXBpdG9sLWhpbGwtYnVybm91dC0yMDIxLTTSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtYXpvbi1leGVjcy1sZWF2aW5nLWRyb3Zlcy1jbG91ZGtpdGNoZW5zLXViZXItY2FwaXRvbC1oaWxsLWJ1cm5vdXQtMjAyMS00P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CloudKitchens Travis Kalanick's latest startup hit by exodus,"Hello!

Hundreds of employees left Travis Kalanick's ghost-kitchen startup this year — in an exodus that reflects long-simmering tensions about leadership secrecy and pay. Inside the organization people described an alpha-male society reflective of Kalanick's first startup:

The Kalanick leading CloudKitchens was not changed humbled or reformed. He was the same Kalanick who in just a few roller-coaster years had turned Uber into a global juggernaut — at one point the world's most valuable tech startup — by barreling full speed ahead and ultimately crashing out.

In one important way though Kalanick has changed. The man leading CloudKitchens is incredibly concerned with secrecy and preventing any challenges to his control and he has designed the company with that in mind.

The result is a business that looks like the old Uber — but without the guardrails. Without a VC-filled board Kalanick who reportedly owns about half the company enjoys free rein to pursue his vision of reinventing the restaurant business.

Given that Amazon has about 350 vice presidents that's a turnover rate of more than 10% in the vice-presidential level and above — rare for a company that once prided itself on the loyalty and long employment history of its most valued senior leaders.

It's one of the most dramatic management upheavals in company history. As Amazon looks to a post-Bezos era the departures present incoming CEO Andy Jassy with the dual challenge of having to work with less familiar faces while maintaining the company's unique culture.

""The risk-reward isn't there for big leaders to stay at Amazon right now"" one former Amazon executive who left in the past year told Insider. ""It would not surprise me if 2021 has more VP attrition than 2020.""

The market for quant and data-science specialists on Wall Street has never been hotter but the trading firms that employ them are highly secretive — as are the recruiters they work with:

""You're OK that I've recorded this call right?""

So said one veteran recruiter who works with proprietary-trading firms before apologizing for his paranoia at the end of a 30-minute conversation. Other headhunters wanted to ensure up front that Insider wasn't secretly recording them (we weren't) and agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity — that what they said wouldn't be attributed to them or their company. Some would dish about the industry or their competitors but discussing clients was verboten.

Welcome to the secretive world of Wall Street quant recruiting.

While secrecy abounds across finance it's especially prevalent in the world of quantitative trading where noncompetes in excess of a year nondisclosure agreements and lawsuits over defectors are common.

Here's what more than two dozen quant recruiters about their competitive stealthy field:

Congressional staffers at all levels — from fellows to chiefs of staff — have struggled with burnout several current and former employees told Insider. They described how remote work obliterated the line between their work and personal lives:

""It was the working from home it was the level of intensity of being a chief of staff the recent passing of my mother"" that led Jose Borjon to look for a job outside the public sector.

Even in normal times working on Capitol Hill is no walk in the park. But after a pandemic a year of remote work feverish partisan rancor surrounding the 2020 presidential election and an unprecedented terrorist attack inside their place of employment the thousands of congressional staffers who make Congress run are burning out. Badly.

Current staff and experts fear the exhaustion and trauma are pushing qualified people out the door exacerbating the long-running problem of brain drain on Capitol Hill while denying lawmakers talented staff members as they try to tackle some of the most pressing issues to face the country in generations.

The research commissioned by Uber surveyed 1000 Australian adults finding that four in five people believed an increase in the uptake of electric vehicles could make a significant contribution to reducing Australia’s transport emissions. It also found that 45 per cent of Australians were willing to pay more for greener transport options.

A third of respondents to Uber’s study also said that the use of electric vehicles in ride share services would help provide an incentive to choose electric transport as their primary transport choice.

While Australians are evidently enthusiastic about making the switch to electric vehicles most of those surveyed said that significant barriers still remain that make it difficult to justify the purchase of an electric model.

See: New EVs wow Shanghai auto show but few are coming to Australia

Uber found that 73 per cent of Australian’s identified the perceived cost of ownership as the top barrier to switching to electric vehicles.

Australia has lagged behind other markets in taking up electric vehicles with just 0.75 per cent of new cars sold in 2020 being all-electric models. This compares to 10.7 per cent in the United Kingdom 8.1 per cent in California.

Significantly around half of respondents said that ensuring electric vehicles were not targeted by new taxes would help provide an incentive to make EVs a preferred transport choice.

State governments have come under fire for the proposed introduction of new road-use taxes that could be imposed on electric vehicles as governments attempt to make up for lost revenue that would otherwise be generated by tariffs on the cost of petrol. This includes a Victorian government plan to tax electric vehicles 2.5 cents for every kilometre driven.

Automakers electric vehicle charging providers and industry groups recently joined together to slam the Victorian government proposal labelling it as ‘the world’s worst EV policy’.

More than two-thirds of those surveyed as part of the Uber study also said that the introduction of supportive government subsidies would help encourage EV usage.

General manager for Uber Australia and New Zealand Dom Taylor said that Australia was falling behind other countries on electric vehicle uptake as other countries were implementing policies to reduce the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle.

“Australians care deeply about our beautiful natural environment but unfortunately as a nation we are behind countries like the US and UK in the effort to switch to electric transport options” Taylor said.

“As Australia leads the world in COVID recovery we have an opportunity to change the way we think about the new normal – with electric vehicles at the forefront of travel.

“We now know Australians are ready to embrace a greener future and are even committed to personally investing their hard-earned dollars into the solution. The public and private sectors need to work together to give them the opportunity to do so and respond to the demand.”

CEO of the Electric Vehicle Council Behyad Jafari said the study showed Australians were eager to make the switch to electric vehicles even if governments appeared to be more ambivalent.

“Australians are way out ahead of their politicians when it comes to understanding the benefits of electric vehicles” Jafari said. “The average Australian understands that electric vehicles help clean the air cut carbon emissions and reduce our dependence on imported oil.

“Australians are early adopters and we hate pollution. It’s painful for most of us to see the world racing ahead with electric vehicles while we get forced into the dirty slow lane.

“With just a little leadership from the top we could get access to the world’s best and most affordable electric cars and start seizing the benefits. Research like this should serve as a horn blast to our elected representatives” Jafari added."

A year after the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic and the quarantines that stopped air travel worldwide generating millions in losses for the entire industry several Colombian airlines have launched new routes in order to get up from what has widely beocme considered to be the worst crisis the commercial aviation has faced in its history.

According to larepública LATAM Airlines Colombia and Wingo are the carriers that have launched the most new routes so far this year adding five and four respectively.

In the case of LATAM at the restart of its operations in September 2020 the carrier operated only nine destinations. Currently in advancing in its recovery plan it already has activated 14 destinations connected by 24 distinct routes

“Supported by the reorganization process in which the companies of the LATAM group in the United States are under the protection of Chapter 11 this will allow us to have lower and more efficient operating costs” said Santiago Álvarez president of LATAM Colombia.

Likewise Wingo which had to suspend its 22 routes due to the pandemic already has its entire network active except for two routes: one flight between Bogota and Caracas Venezuela and another from Bogota to Curaçao.

“We have added three new national routes from Bogotá to Medellín Cali and Santa Marta thus tripling our offer of chairs. In addition we added a new flight between Medellín and Cancun” Carolina Cortizo general director of Wingo said in a statement.

For its part Avianca operates more than 40 domestic routes in Colombia in addition to more than 15 international ones with around 800 frequencies totaling some 110000 weekly seats. Recently the airline launched domestic routes between Pereira and Santa Marta Pereira and Cartagena and San Andrés and Cartagena.

“On the international side in July we will start direct flights on the Medellín-Cancun and Medellín-Punta Cana routes” said Silvia Mosquera commercial vice president of Avianca Holdings in a separate statement.

Additionally Viva Air reactivated its 26 routes and inaugurated two new routes in the domestic market: Medellín to Bucaramanga and Medellín to Cúcuta.

“In June we will begin operations of four new international routes: Medellín-Cancun Medellín-Orlando Medellín-Mexico City and Bogota-Mexico City” Viva Air Commercial Director Juan Diego Zapata said in a statement adding that last month the airline grew its total available seats by 30% to 2019.

At the beginning of 2020 Colombian low-cost carrier Easyfly operated 44 routes that connected a network of 30 cities. “To date we have recovered 86% of our routes” said Isaac Herrera the airline’s product manager.

Despite the almost universal relaunch of service Avianca believes the increase in flights going forward will largely depend on the evolution of the pandemic since in recent weeks restrictions in several cities have undoubtedly impacted the movement of passengers for the purpose of tourism.

In the first three months of the year LATAM Airlines Colombia reached 85% of its operational capacity and transported more than one million passengers. Easyfly estimates that it stopped moving 1.5 million passengers due to restrictions. However for the second quarter of 2021 the company projects 100% recovery at its destinations. Viva Air announced that in the last month it flew with an average load factor of 80%.

Earth Day just came and went and hopefully you took a pause and thought about your environmental footprint. Going plastic-free eating less seafood and buying environmentally-friendly gifts are all great steps you can take to live a more eco-conscious life. It’s all about eliminating waste and recycling as much as possible and there are new products coming out all the time aimed at making every corner of your life more sustainable. A brand new one for me? Reusable garbage bags. I know it sounds potentially ridiculous and very gross but hear me out.

Today's Top Deals

Using fewer single-use plastics is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint as an individual. We produce upwards of 300 million tons of plastic each year as a human race a staggering number and about half of that is single-use plastics. They’re made primarily out of fossil fuel-based chemicals and designed to be thrown away almost as soon as you get them. Not very sustainable and garbage bags are a great example of one. They’re unpacked used until full and then thrown away without a ton of regard for the added waste they themselves are contributing to landfills. However there is a more sustainable and reusable option out there.

TOMbag Reusable Garbage Bag

Reusable garbage bags are made out of durable strong usually recycled material and are designed to be washed after each use. They made excellent liners for smaller garbage or recycling cans throughout your house or can be used in the kitchen for your messiest garbage with a solid cleansing routine. They’re waterproof and some even have handles for making carrying and emptying easy.

One could also argue that using a reusable trash bag will make you more conscious of what you put in it. A compost bin might help you divert messy food waste from going in the bag and needing to be cleaned out afterwards. Recycling properly will also cut down on what you place in the reusable garbage bag and thinking of other innovative ways you can reuse items like plastic containers. Switching to longer-lasting reusable versions of items like floss straws silverware and napkins will also lighten your load.

Story continues

In my opinion it’s possible if you’ve got the time and patience for doing a little extra clean-up. This might be you — or you might find other preferable methods for being gentler on the earth. Whatever you can do it’s a step in the right direction.

URI,United Rentals,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMS8wNC8wNC0yNS1TdW5kYXktTm90ZWJvb2stU3RQZXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paddock Buzz: Rahal Rossi Keep Cool after Contact,"Respect between a pair of veteran NTT INDYCAR SERIES drivers allowed the fallout of a flat right-front tire to not be a hot-topic issue.

Alexander Rossi and Graham Rahal were battling for position approaching Turn 4 in Sunday’s Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg when Rahal dove to the inside of Rossi in a bid to draw alongside him. Their contact cut Rossi’s tire keeping him from being able to turn his No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda as they arrived at Turn 5. They bumped twice more before coming to a stop.

Rahal was able to get his No. 15 United Rentals Honda backed up to continue in rather short order but many positions had already been lost both drivers’ chance at good results gone. Rahal finished 15th Rossi 21st in the 24-car field.

“I think it was a little bit of a racing incident” Rahal said. “Obviously I had a bit of a slow pit stop (just prior to the contact); I think he might have as well. We thought we were just going to (pass) him.”

Rahal said he “had to make the move” entering Turn 4 because of there are only three legitimate passing zones on this 14-turn 1.8-mile circuit.

“(Contact) happens” Rahal said. “Alex is a pretty fair guy so I don’t think there are any hard feelings. It’s a shame for the flat right front because I think we both could have gone through perfectly fine and continued our days. But it is what it is.”

Rossi said he was still on cold tires and therefore not yet up to full speed when the initial incident occurred.

“I feel like I gave him room – I didn’t have him on the curb or anything” Andretti Autosport driver Rossi said. “It’s one of those racing things.

“Obviously looking at (the television replay) it’s unfortunate he ended up on the outside of me when I had the flat tire. I wasn’t trying to drive him into Turn 5. The contact in Turn 4 is what kind of caused our issue and it’s one of those things – you’re racing for the same piece of real estate.”

Rossi’s poor finish dropped him to 16th in the standings after two races not the position he hoped to be in after struggling through last year’s winless season. But he refused to hang his head.

“I think frustration building in the past has cost us” he said. “The good thing is the car is fast. That’s usually the harder problem to fix. It’s a lot different than last year when we were having these issues and didn’t have car speed.

“The car is quick this year and at one point things will line up for us.”

Bourdais Delivers Another Strong Result

Members of AJ Foyt Racing have taken to calling Sebastien Bourdais the “Million Dollar Man” after his fourth-place finish in last year’s season-ending race in St. Petersburg secured their place in INDYCAR’s Leaders Circle program for 2021. That bonus is worth approximately $1 million per entry annually.

Bourdais is still paying dividends to the team which signed him last year with Sunday’s 10th-place finish paired nicely with the fifth place finished he delivered last week at Barber Motorsports Park.

After two races the driver of the No. 14 ROKit Chevrolet is tied for sixth place in the standings just 16 points out of the lead.

Bourdais who lives only about a mile north of the track in St. Petersburg completed this 100-lap race when it seemed like he might not even get started. He sat on pit road for the two warmup laps while the crew switched out the radio in the car’s footbox.

Then in the opening journey through the tight Turn 1 Bourdais had nose contact with Josef Newgarden’s No. 2 Hitachi Chevrolet and side contact with another Team Penske driver Simon Pagenaud in the No. 22 Menards/Australian Gold Chevrolet. Remarkably Bourdais didn’t even lose a position despite damaging his car’s nose with an onboard camera dangling from the front for most of the race.

Bourdais should be getting used to driving a wounded car. Last month he drove the final winning segment of IMSA’s 12 Hours of Sebring sports car race with a damaged rear wing and he finished last week’s Barber race with sidepod damage.

On ‘Road to Indy’

David Malukas of HMD Motorsports finished the Indy Lights presented by Cooper Tires weekend with a second podium finish winning the Sunday race after finishing third Saturday. The win was his second of the season having taken the second race last week at Barber Motorsports Park. Andretti Autosport’s Kyle Kirkwood who won Saturday’s race finished second in this one.

Christian Rasmussen of Jay Howard Driver Development scored a convincing 7.3-second victory in the Indy Pro 2000 race Sunday. The win was his first in the series in three starts; he finished second Saturday.

Up Next for INDYCAR

Fans of next weekend’s INDYCAR doubleheader at Texas Motor Speedway will get a preview of pit stops Friday in an event directly behind the Fort Worth Library. The 2nd Cowtown Pit Stop Challenge will feature Team Penske vs. Chip Ganassi Racing in a four-crew battle.

Josef Newgarden and Will Power will represent Team Penske while Tony Kanaan and Alex Palou will compete for the Ganassi team. The event begins at noon local time on 2nd Street between Taylor and Burnett Streets.

The Genesys 300 will be held Saturday at 7 p.m. (ET) with the XPEL 375 on Sunday at 5 p.m. (ET). Both races will air live on NBCSN with practice sessions and qualifying on Peacock Premium NBC’s streaming service available at www.peacocktv.com.

INDYCAR’s competitor field certainly will look different. Kanaan will take Jimmie Johnson’s place Carlin will announce this week who will drive its No. 59 Chevrolet that Max Chilton pilots in road and street-course races Ed Carpenter returns to his No. 20 Chevrolet driven so far this year by Daly and Pietro Fittipaldi steps in for fellow rookie Romain Grosjean in the No. 51 Honda of Dale Coyne Racing with RWR. Twenty-four car-and-driver combinations are again expected.

Dixon dominated last year’s Texas race leading 157 of the 200 laps as part of three consecutive victories to open his sixth championship-winning season. Dixon has four wins at the 1.5-mile oval tied with Helio Castroneves for the sport’s all-time lead at the track.

Odds and Ends

Alex Palou the driver of the No. 10 NTT DATA Honda of Chip Ganassi Racing continues to hold the series lead but his advantage is just two points over a pair of former series champions -- teammate Scott Dixon and Team Penske’s Will Power. Power claims second place in a tiebreaker because he has the better finish this season second last weekend at Barber. Dixon who drives the No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda is off to a good start in his bid to earn a record-tying seventh INDYCAR championship finishing fifth Sunday after a third-place finish at Barber. Power has finished second and eighth in the No. 12 Verizon 5G Team Penske Chevrolet. After winning the Barber race Palou was 17th in Round 2.

Pato O’Ward the driver of the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet had one of the strongest cars at Barber where he won the pole and finished fourth. But this weekend was different. He never seemed to have his car rolling in the same manner and his sixth-place start was reduced to a 19th-place finish after late-race contact with Ed Jones the driver of the No. 18 SealMaster Honda of Dale Coyne Racing with Vasser Sullivan.

Takuma Sato was one of the biggest movers of the race in the No. 15 Panasonic/Shield Cleaners Honda of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing advancing nine positions in the race to finish sixth. Right behind him was Marcus Ericsson in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate of Chip Ganassi Racing. He too improved nine spots to finish seventh. Power improved 12 spots from his 20th starting position.

Overall INDYCAR’s rookies fared reasonably well given they had no preseason track time on this temporary street circuit. Team Penske’s Scott McLaughlin (No. 3 DEX Imaging Chevrolet) finished 11th with Romain Grosjean of Dale Coyne Racing with RWR (No. 51 Nurtec ODT Honda) in the 13th position and Chip Ganassi Racing’s Jimmie Johnson (No. 48 Carvana Honda) 22nd. Johnson had an off early in the race approaching the final corner then spun in Turn 3 late in the race. This was his first race of any kind on a street circuit.

Ed Carpenter Racing’s Rinus VeeKay (No. 21 SONAX/Autogeek Chevrolet) finished seventh in just the second street-course race of his INDYCAR career. He finished 15th in this event last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvZ2FyeS1uZXZpbGxlLWJyaW5ncy1sdXh1cnktcmVudGFscy10by1tYW5jaGVzdGVyLWZvci0yMC0wMDAtYS1tb250aC1iZ2R2Z3drOHLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gary Neville brings luxury rentals to Manchester for £20000 a month,"During his long career in football as a player pundit and coach the former Manchester United and England right-back Gary Neville has been steadily amassing a property development portfolio worth £10.5 million.

Among his latest acquisitions are four elegant Georgian townhouses on St John Street in Manchester city centre in a conservation area near Deansgate. The first of the four to be completed is now available for rent at £20000 a month.

Inevitably St John Street has already been dubbed Manchester’s “millionaires’ row”. Even fully furnished with 5350 sq ft of living space fashionably stripped-back brick walls four bedrooms four reception rooms a double garage for the Bentley and a covered outdoor terrace with a retractable roof what kind of rental commands this kind of money in a northern city still reeling from the economic effects of the pandemic?

A rare one it seems. “St John Street is the only tree-lined Georgian street in the city centre and it ends in a park [St John’s Gardens]” says Anthony Stankard managing director of Reside the property company marketing Neville’s townhouse. “Despite being minutes from Spinningfields and the bustle of the city it feels very discreet.”

He adds: “We’re expecting interest from CEOs who want a base in the city. With many companies making a move out of London we expect to see demand for this level of property. Or high-net-worth individuals who like the idea of a substantial home minutes from the heart of things but on a quiet street. The option to rent gives flexibility that many people want right now or require if they are moving to a new city and need to set up home quickly.”

There are many notable historic buildings in the centre of Manchester but relatively few are full houses or offer the potential for re-conversion. Lever Street in the Northern Quarter with several old townhouses is a notable exception. But typically it’s warehouses mills factories and commercial buildings such as banks that have been given a new lease of residential life by developers and private buyers.

The wealthy and well-to-do rapidly moved out to the suburbs as the Industrial Revolution began to shroud the city in smoke and noise. The houses they left behind including those on St John Street built between 1770 and 1850 were either demolished or found their own commercial use. Until recently this area was dominated by private medical practices and barristers’ chambers and at times squatters.

Then about three years ago buyers spotted the potential and these dusty and half-forgotten buildings started to sell for between £500000 to £750000 each. Stankard explains that seven houses on the “odd” side of the street numbers 11 to 23 have all now been purchased and there are potentially 11 possible further homes to be created opposite from numbers 8 to 28.

Neville’s second townhouse is being renovated in a similar style to his first No 21. It is due to be completed this summer and will offer just under 5000 sq ft of accommodation. The two others will follow.

Inside one of the houses on St John Street RESIDE MANCHESTER/OBI

Neville 46 a founder of the business network UnitedCity is a fanatical supporter of city-centre regeneration. These new signings highlight a serious gap in the market; he believes that Manchester city centre needs “really high-specification properties really top-of-the-range accommodation as it progresses. There is room in the market for all different types of residences but where we miss out is in providing that level of housing. If people are moving to Manchester and they want a top international-standard house or apartment then they will struggle in the city centre and that needs to be put right.”

“St John Street does indeed represent a landmark shift” Stankard agrees. “However we also completed two weavers’ cottages on Liverpool Road 100 metres away in Castlefield last year and have another one under way so this whole area right in the very centre of Manchester has the opportunity to create this kind of home.”

Most people fired him for being rude and full of himself but perhaps the best comment of all time was from an IG user who commented on UTV’s post of the moment he insulted DKB and the comedian threatened to walk out.

His daughter Vivian now 5 years old benefited from a tube implanted in her ears using a Preceptis Hummingbird device. The procedure was done in a doctor's office. No hospital operating room or anesthesia was needed. That made it far less costly than the standard procedure which can run up to $5000 and less worrying. Vivian previously had a set of tubes inserted in the traditional manner.

""I'll never forget the moment we handed our 9-month-old baby to the nurse to be put under general anesthesia"" Delgado said. ""It was very traumatic for me and my wife. After her tubes fell out in four months my wife and I both wanted an alternative.

""With Preceptis the experience was dramatically different. She recovered immediately and was smiling within a minute of the procedure being completed. That's why I'm so passionate about what we're doing.""

There are more than 1 million pediatric ear-tube procedures in the U.S. performed annually by ear nose and throat (ENT) doctors mostly in operating rooms.

But after a decade of development including $26 million in investor capital Preceptis is gaining traction with the device that simplifies such procedures.

A 250-child study of its procedure in 2018 and 2019 was covered in the Laryngoscope an ENT peer-reviewed journal. The Food and Drug Administration gave clearance and the American Academy of Otolaryngology endorsed the device for in-office procedures.

""We have received orders from Health Partners St. Cloud ENT and the Mayo Clinic"" said Steve Anderson chief executive of Preceptis. ""That being said ear-tube procedures are down 80 to 90% this year due to COVID-19. But ENT doctors pediatricians and Preceptis expect tube procedures to start coming back in the second quarter and return to more normal in 2022.""

The Hummingbird device which costs less than $1000 was invented in part by Dr. Michael Loushin an anesthesiologist. Loushin and Anderson were neighbors in Roseville when about 15 years ago they started talking about alternatives to surgery for children who needed tubes for ongoing ear infections.

In 2013 Preceptis won the Minnesota Cup competition for innovative business plans as well as an industry-technology award. However the FDA slowed the company's jump into office procedures. The agency required that tests first be done in operating rooms with patients under sedation but not general anesthesia. It worked. The study in 2018 and 2019 was done by ENT surgeons in their offices without anesthesia.

""It's an enormous cost saver"" Anderson said. ""The money comes right off the top. You go from operating room to office. Everybody knows that saves money. And moms like this. That's huge. They love this thing. Every case we do the moms and dads virtually become spokespeople for us.""

Anderson has elected to conserve capital by not hiring a sales force. Preceptis instead is working directly with several care providers including Mayo Clinic and Health Partners on a pilot commercialization to validate the business model.

Preceptis' most significant competitor is Tusker Medical which received FDA approval for a drug/device combination product in 2019. It was acquired by Smith & Nephew a British medical device company in 2020.

Anderson said he's not pressured to sell the company because his investors which include affluent individuals and a Chinese medical concern are patient. Children's Minnesota recently put in $1 million. He has avoided traditional venture capital.

""Our investors believe in where we are going"" Anderson said. ""That we can become a standard of care.""

Maple Grove-based Preceptis designs and manufactures the product in the Twin Cities.

""Our goal now is to not raise a huge amount of capital and hire a whole bunch of sales reps"" Anderson said. ""We don't think we need to do that. What we are doing now is a commercial pilot. We want to validate the business model and then we can decide to add representatives and grow or partner with a larger company.

""Eventually after the commercial pilot we may hire a sales force. Or we could be a good fit with a larger corporation.""

It's encouraging to see a health care innovator that economically improves care.

This follows a pattern: the three decades since the end of the Hoxhaist regime in 1991 have seen these two parties alternate in government leading the country from a planned economy toward the free market. In the early years following the collapse of the dictatorship the main economic and financial reforms promoted by both main parties consisted of stabilizing the currency privatizing state-run enterprises and opening the market to foreign investors. This soon hit trouble: the failure of Ponzi schemes in 1997 prompted a near-civil-war situation. But over the last two decades the Albanian economy has been relatively stable with GDP growth peaking at 4.1 percent in 2018 albeit falling back the following year due to a series of both natural and governmental disasters. Unemployment figures are however still high and volatile — even the low of 12.3 percent reached in 2018 was considerably higher than the average for EU countries. During its two terms in office Edi Rama’s nominally socialist PS has attracted wide criticism for its ties with business magnates. Even a former foreign minister in Rama’s government Ditmir Bushati denounced the problem as he pointed out that national wealth is concentrated in the hands of four of five oligarchs. Along with critical views from within the PS the government has faced clear discontent reflected in numerous and massive protests organized by students mine workers and opposition leaders. Rama’s administration has also courted controversy for its use of public funds spending more than €40 million on renovating government buildings in a country where GDP per capita is only $4700. Other scandals include one of its interior ministers being accused of drug trafficking as well as wider claims of a lack of transparency in public procurement. Illustrating the prevalence of this issue in Albanian politics in September 2020 PD’s parliamentary group even filed a lawsuit against then–defense minister Olta Xhaçka and interior minister Sandër Lleshaj. While these parties have dominated the post-transition period there have been occasional signs of alternatives emerging. Erion Veliaj mayor of the capital Tirana started his political career in 2009 by founding a new party called G99; it originated in Levizja Mjaft a social movement created in 2003 to protest poor public services organized crime poverty and discrimination. But Veliaj and a few crucial personalities from G99 later joined PS. This does not mean that PS is itself a space for critical voices. For this election it has some new candidates including Dr Najada Como a well-respected doctor and director of Tirana’s hospital of infectious diseases who has been on the front lines of the COVID-19 battle and has become a beloved figure. Yet it has also excluded thirty-five well-known left-wing personalities from its list; former foreign minister Ditmir Bushati has also been dropped following his criticism of the party’s ties to oligarchs.

Miner Parties The situation for forces outside the PS has however slightly changed. In 2020 the parliament amended the electoral code: one measure lowered the election threshold meaning a party needs just 1 percent across Albania to qualify for parliamentary representation. This will doubtless ease the path of new parties. Moreover a whole generation that was born after the fall of the Hoxhaist regime are now running for election outside the lists of the two main parties and no longer so governed by rival attitudes toward the communist era as the PS-PD duo. One especially promising candidacy is miners’ union leader Elton Debreshi an independent backed by activists from OP (Organizata Politike) the largest leftist organization in Albania. Debreshi’s program combines local issues (improved transportation the protection of forests and rivers) with a wider focus on workers’ rights and social rights. These demands especially arise from the dire working conditions in the Albanian mining industry where the last half century has seen 531 deaths due to poor safety measures. Debreshi is running in Dibra in one of the poorest regions in Albania and is combining a bid for improved status for miners with a broader social program. Albania does still have elements of a universal health care system currently offering a free full checkup once per year for those aged between thirty-five and seventy years old. Debreshi promises to fight for special health care conditions to be given to mine workers and extend the yearly checkup to full checkups twice a year along with free treatment of occupational diseases and full refunds for medication. Another force on the Left of Albanian politics is Lëvizja Vetëvendosje (LVV Self-Determination Movement) a progressive party that recently won a landslide 50 percent vote in neighboring Kosovo. It is backing three independent candidates: Boiken Abazi Iliaz Shehu and Kreshnik Merxhani. The involvement of Vetëvendosje in Albanian politics signals its commitment to advance a possible unification. Albin Kurti the historical leader of LVV has publicly stated that in a hypothetical future referendum on unification he would vote in favor. One of the candidates LVV supports Boiken Abazi is a well-known activist. Previously connected to the Mjaft Movement and Tirana mayor Erion Veliaj Abazi joined LVV and quickly became a crucial figure in the party becoming its international spokesman. Abazi is running in the Tirana region; the main point of his electoral program consists in the proposal of a new economic deal that would fight poverty through soft loans protection of natural resources and a gradual replacement of imported products with Albanian ones. Another LVV-backed candidate Iliaz Shehu is running in his hometown of Lezha. His political program calls for a higher budget in the health sector (from 5.2 to 9.9 percent of GDP) and a higher budget in education (rising from 3.6 to 4.9 percent) bringing Albania up to the EU standard. Kreshnik Merxhani an architect by profession is running in Gjirokastra a region he knows well due to his work on the preservation of its cultural heritage which also plays an important role in his program.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vYXVyb3JhLmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTE0NDAyOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Roadmap for Universal Health Coverage - Recent - Aurora,"Although the Sehat Sahulat Program is an important step towards providing universal health coverage to the citizens of Pakistan the government will have to invest in healthcare infrastructure to achieve sustainable success.

When his physician told Rehman Gull 42 that he needed a minor surgical procedure to cure his back pain he didn’t have to worry about how to cover his hospital expenditures surgeon fees lab tests and medicines. The next morning he checked into a private hospital in Peshawar underwent the procedure and returned home after three days without paying a single paisa.

“I just had to produce my CNIC to prove that I am a permanent resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) to avail the facility of free hospitalisation and treatment” says Gull a resident of Jhagra village who works as an office attendant at a media company in Peshawar.

KPK’s Sehat Sahulat Program (SSP) provides universal access to healthcare to permanent residents of Pakistan’s North-Western province like Gull and their families which they could not otherwise afford. The program entitles 7.2 million families free in-patient treatment for up to one million rupees per family a year. “They only need to present their CNIC at the SSP counters set up at the 400 ‘empanelled’ private and public-sector hospitals across the province – and in Islamabad Punjab and Karachi for non-resident families” says Zain Raza an analyst working with the Internal Support Unit of the provincial Health and Finance Department.

Gull is not the only one from his extended family to have availed the free health facility. His sister-in-law was recently treated for heart issues. Another family member underwent a minor procedure two months earlier. “This is an amazing facility for the poor and low-income people like myself” says Gull the father of four children. “Now we don’t have to worry about money when we need hospitalisation.”

How It Began

In 2012 the Federal Government introduced a micro health insurance scheme for the beneficiaries of its flagship social protection program the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP recently rebranded by the PTI government as Ehsaas) under which the poorest of the poor and their families were provided monthly stipends. Taking a cue from this Punjab rolled out its own initiative and enrolled 75000 poor families between 2012 and 2014. In 2015 the Federal Government launched a national health programme in the former FATA districts of KPK – with Punjab Sindh and Balochistan adopting it later. This programme has been extended to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.

PTI-led KPK however chose to independently launch and pursue its own project in four districts with support from Germany and then expanded the scope to the entire population with the government assuming the costs for all citizens. This decision was made to avoid ‘exclusion and inclusion errors’ owing to the outdated BISP 2011 poverty survey data.

“Setting up a social health protection scheme is a step-by-step process. KPK launched its pilot in 2015 targeting the poorest 21% in four districts. A year later the Provincial Government decided to invest its own money to expand the coverage to all districts and the poorest 50% of the population. And from November 2020 the health insurance scheme has been available to every resident and non-resident citizen of the province irrespective of their income” says Riaz Tanoli Project Director for the provincial SSP.

“In addition to the provincial programme a similar federal facility is being provided to the 1.2 million people of the former FATA districts where each family is entitled to free treatment worth Rs 750000 per year.” According to Tanoli the province plans to expand the health insurance coverage to liver and kidney transplants. “For this we are in the process of signing an agreement with a hospital in Islamabad.”

How the Program Works

To avoid complications KPK adopted a single-payer model whereby it fully subsidises the annual premium of Rs 2849 per family from its health budget and contracted the State Life Insurance Company (SLIC) to manage the healthcare expenditure as a third-party administrator. The insurer negotiates provider contracts with the empanelled hospitals including the treatment packages and the amount of reimbursement. Data on the beneficiaries and their use of services are managed by NADRA and SLIC which is also responsible for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the empanelled hospitals and excluding poor performers from the contracts.

“The contract has been awarded to SLIC through national competitive bidding. Eight firms applied and three were shortlisted” Tanoli says. “The premium is paid through the government budget. We allocated Rs 10 billion for the ongoing financial year. The premium amount is likely to rise to Rs 21 billion in the next fiscal year.” According to him at least 75000 people have so far taken advantage of this health insurance whichspared them a combined expenditure of two billion rupees between November 2020 and February 2021.

Tanoli says that the government paid the insurance company the entire premium for the year in a lump sum. “Under the contract the company is entitled to keep 15% of the saving (unspent amount from the total premium) and return the remaining 85% to the government at the end of the year. If the expenditure crosses the agreed premium amount the risk is borne by the insurer.”

The Provincial Government feels that it can easily manage the costs for the next three years. “After that period we will have a fair idea of the rate of increase in expenditure as more people become aware of the scheme and begin using it” contends Tanoli. He is of the view that the scheme will ultimately reduce government expenditure on public-sector hospitals going forward as they start earning money from their contracts with the insurer leading to a significant reduction in the subsidy amount the government has to pay them from its budget.

Punjab Lags Behind

Pursuing the KPK model the Usman Buzdar government plans to extend the coverage of its health insurance project to the entire population of Punjab by the end of 2021 although so far it lags behind KPK. According to officials Punjab has so far succeeded in bringing health coverage to the 5.3 million out of nine million families living below the poverty line in 28 districts in two years. “We are increasing the scope of the scheme and issuing health insurance cards to eligible families. So far 290000 in-patients have availed free medical treatment and we are quickly moving towards universal health coverage” says a health department official. In Punjab the government is paying SLIC a premium of Rs 1998 per family to provide health coverage of Rs 720000 per family per year. “Once we achieve universal coverage the premium will go up and the expenditure ceiling for each family will be enhanced to one million rupees.”

The publicly funded SSP is an important step towards universal health coverage that delivers healthcare to everyone equally and free of cost. However it is unlikely to meet its goal unless the provinces start investing in health infrastructure bringing modern diagnostic and treatment facilities closer to the areas where the poor and vulnerable targeted under the scheme actually live. Unless the infrastructure is created the majority of the people will remain excluded from the so-called universal health coverage.

Update on June 29 at 9:50 a.m. PT: A domestic violence bill coined “Jennifer’s Law”—in honor of missing mother Jennifer Dulos—has been signed into law in Connecticut by Gov. Ned Lamont. State Sen. Alex Kasser who represents Jennifer’s district and introduced the bill in the Senate calls it “groundbreaking domestic violence legislation two years in the making that can’t wait any longer.”

Update on June 5 at 7:53 a.m. PT: The Connecticut House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 1091 otherwise known as “Jennifers’ Law” on Friday June 4 with a final vote of 134 to 8. The bill now heads to Governor Lamont’s desk for his signature.

Update on May 18 at 5:10 p.m. PT: The Connecticut Senate passed Jennifers’ Law (SB 1091) by a vote of 35–1. The bill now moves to the House for a vote.

“If I limped onto the court you’d notice. If I had black eyes and broken bones you’d notice. If I had marks on my arms and fear in my voice you’d notice. It’d be easy to see that I need help to know something was wrong. But what about the abuse you can’t see?”

Serena Williams said these words in a 60-second public-service video to raise awareness about financial abuse—when an intimate partner controls access to money including hiding assets keeping a victim from getting a job or denying them access to a bank or credit card account.

Williams’s video is part of a growing movement to raise awareness about non-physical forms of domestic abuse known as coercive control which includes psychological emotional sexual and financial abuse.

“Coercive control deprives people—mostly women—of their liberty” said Dr. Lisa Aronson Fontes a University of Massachusetts professor and author of Invisible Chains: Overcoming Coercive Control in Your Intimate Relationship. “The freedoms that every human being should enjoy—to make the small and large decisions about her life—are not accessible to a victim of coercive control. She is hostage to the whims of her partner.”

Coercive control includes isolating an intimate partner from friends and family; depriving them of basic necessities; monitoring and controlling their activities and communications; gaslighting; frequent name-calling degradation and demeaning behavior; damaging property or household goods; and threatening to publish sexualized images of them.

“Coercive control is a gateway to physical violence” said Doreen Hunter co-founder of the Americas Conference to End Coercive Control. “A high percentage of people who engage in coercive control will eventually resort to physical violence.”

Earlier this month the Connecticut Senate Judiciary Committee passed SB-1091 that would expand the state’s definition of domestic abuse to include coercive control. Lead sponsor Sen. Alex Kasser calls her bill Jennifers’ law after Jennifer Dulos and Jennifer Magnano. Dulos’s estranged husband was accused of abducting her from her home in New Canaan Connecticut in May of 2019 and murdering her. Dulos had sought a restraining order and emergency custody of her five children when she left her husband in June 2017 but a judge denied her request because she could not show she was physically abused. Dulos’s body has not yet been found but she has been declared dead. Charged with murder and other crimes her husband committed suicide in February of 2020. Magnano was murdered in 2007 by her abusive husband Scott Magnano who then committed suicide. Both Jennifers experienced coercive control.

Kasser’s proposed law would make it easier for abuse victims to obtain restraining orders and protect their children.

“Coercive control legislation would enable people who have been victimized by their partners (or ex-partners) to bring the totality of experience to bear” said Fontes. “It would expose the truth—that domestic abuse is not simply the ‘big violent assaults’ but also the entire picture in which one person deprives another of resources and their freedom. Many victims of domestic abuse report that the physical violence was not the worst part. This new category of criminal offense would capture a pattern of behavior that current law addresses poorly if at all.”

Several countries including Scotland France England Wales and Ireland have adopted coercive control laws over the last decade. Hawaii and California passed the first such laws in the United States last year.

The Hawaii law defines coercive control as a “pattern of threatening humiliating or intimidating actions [that] … take away the individual’s liberty or freedom and strip away the individual’s sense of self including bodily integrity and human rights.” The Hawaii law allows courts to consider evidence of coercive control when deciding whether to issue a protective order against a family or household member. Hawaii is now considering whether to make coercive control a misdemeanor.

The California law defines coercive control as a “pattern of behavior that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes with a person’s free will and personal liberty.” The law applies to protective orders but also amends the state’s family code so that coercive control will be considered in custody and visitation decisions.

The state of Washington also recently passed a law prohibiting abusive litigation against domestic violence survivors including misusing family law cases or civil lawsuits in order to control harass intimidate coerce and/or impoverish an abused partner. The law provides the courts with tools to curb “procedural abuse” and to mitigate its harms.

Other states currently considering coercive control laws include New York South Carolina and Maryland.

“Other changes that would help reduce the way in which people are trapped in abusive relationships include access to a living wage affordable housing universal health care and a great deal of training and education for police judges medical providers and the general public.”

But coercive control laws are an important part of addressing the abuse you cannot see and preventing the physical violence that often follows from it.

Moore Jr. pictured here with POOR Magazine’s Tiny Gray-Garcia has lived in the Acton Courtyard Apartments in Berkeley for 17 years experiencing the same difficulties disabled people report facing due to neglect of subsidized housing all over the country from broken elevators to bedbugs. – Photo: San Francisco State University

by Leroy F. Moore Jr.

It was 2004-05 when I saw Acton Courtyard go up because I lived next door in a small studio and saw an empty lot grow into a beautiful state-of-the-art large apartment complex. I was excited for a chance to go from a studio that was so small I had to go outside to change my mind.

I was new to Berkeley because like many others I was gentrified from the Mission District in San Francisco. I pulled all the strings to get an emergency housing voucher – getting letters from the mayor of Berkeley and from Rep. Barbara Lee and other housing advocates. Plus an agency for people with disabilities helped out a lot!

I was one of the first groups of people to move into Acton Courtyard and it was beautiful clean and came with cable free wifi and more. The beauty didn’t last as the property changed owners constantly. Original residents started to move out. That’s when Equity Residential started to come after me with notes and phone calls saying that I didn’t pay rent for months.

After going through the hassle of dealing with my bank to prove that they were wrong I realized another long-time resident was dealing with the same harassment. Then came the broken elevator in 2015 that lasted almost a month over the Thanksgiving holiday until we wrote an article in the Berkeley Planet and got a lawyer. That case took almost three years to settle. Our collective sustained efforts strengthened local laws related to repairing elevators and the need for more inspections and notifications for residents when the work will be done.

Now in 2021 my neighbors and I have seen a drastic cutback in the upkeep of the building – from spots on the dirty carpet to dead plants racist stickers and urine in the elevator. It has been a slow crawl to criminal malfeasance which happens in buildings serving low and no-income tenants by landlords who don’t care.

My second hotel stay was in March 2021 because of infestation of bedbugs. Both times my community – aka Poor Magazine and a friend – saved me by helping me throw 95 percent of my clothes and furniture out and raise emergency funds to put me up in a hotel.

I found out that the new owner sold its other properties that were nicer compared to Acton Courtyard. Equity Residential tried to sell Acton Courtyard but no one wanted it. In 2016 I asked if I could transfer to another Berkeley unit before they sold them off. The landlord told me that it was an eight-year waiting list just to transfer to another building.

At the same time I would come home from college campus lectures in places like New York to Toronto and see a three-day eviction notice. It happened over and over again! Another change: The so-called upper-class residents were leaving quickly. Acton Courtyard became a building for only low-income residents and that’s when the cutback of services in the building started from firing the live-in manager to keeping the carpet clean and letting plants die.

In 2015 managers of Acton Courtyard Apartments in Berkeley became notorious for failing for weeks to fix broken elevators in the complex which houses multiple disabled individuals and families who became trapped in their apartments unable to leave as a result of the severe negligence of the building by property manager Equity Residential. – Photo: Equity Residential

I know that the cutbacks on the upkeep of the building have led to the year-long outbreak of bedbugs that infested my apartment in fall 2020. And because the landlord has not taken this outbreak of bedbugs seriously I had to stay in a local hotel almost all on my own dime and with help from friends.

I started typing this from my second hotel stay in March 2021 because of infestation of bedbugs. Both times my community – aka Poor Magazine and a friend – saved me by helping me throw 95 percent of my clothes and furniture out and raise emergency funds to put me up in a hotel.

The first time I was away from my apartment for almost two months between the hotel and an offer from a friend to stay at her place. In turn the landlord offered me $1500 to reimburse me for my hotel stay and the contract they wanted me to sign said that Acton Courtyard used a heat treatment to kill the bedbugs.

You can’t tell me that the city is not in the pocket of the landlord.

In addition I must bring up that before my friend and Poor Magazine got me into a hotel the landlord was rude to me and my sister. They told me that it was up to me to clean the apartment and get it ready for the treatment. When I reminded them that I have certain accommodations as a disabled person they told me that “maybe your family or in-home support person can help you clean”!

Before I moved back in the first time in January 2021 I called the city to come to inspect my place. The city inspector came and saw two bedbugs. On Jan. 16 2021 I moved back into my place and noticed that the landlord didn’t clean the carpet so I hired a company to deep clean my carpets on my dime.

Two weeks back in my apartment I noticed I was beginning again to itch. Then two bedbugs appeared on my white pillowcase. I stayed as long as I could handle it. Once again my friends came in and got me to the same hotel in March 2021.

The city came out again and noticed bedbugs in their own traps they put down in my apartment plus two bedbugs on my bed. The company that my building hired to treat the bedbugs had this conversation with me:

Bedbug company guy: It’s getting better.

Leroy: Look on my pillow.

Bedbug company guy: But it’s only two and only in the living room.

Leroy: But as you see there is nothing in the bedroom and I sleep in the living room where the city person found three in their trap and as you can see on my pillow and sheet – at least three!

Bedbug company guy: But Leroy you have to admit it’s getting better!

Leroy: But … never mind …

I started writing this on March 16 2021 my last night in the hotel. After not hearing from my landlord on when the treatment would be over and when would it be safe to move back in I emailed to ask when the treatment would be done. They emailed me back to say yes the treatment was done and it’s safe to move back in.

I saw bedbugs on my pillow I decided to sleep in the bathroom – sometimes in a chair and sometimes in the tub.

Throughout this bedbug situation my friends and the organization Poor Magazine have not only put me up at a hotel but have helped throw away 95 percent of my clothing and furniture and buy and wash new clothes but they also started a fundraiser and made sure I had food!

As I make my way back to my apartment for the second time after being dis/misplaced my confidence in my landlord to do the right thing – like treating the whole building or at least my neighbors – is on zero. So that’s why the only option is to write my story and also look for another place to live in Berkeley!

March 19 2021: Hold up! I go on Berkeley Tenants Union to speak to a lawyer. It cost five dollars to type questions then they gave me an option to get a call from a lawyer for $60.00. So I took it and paid them. That was yesterday – still no call. WTF. You can’t tell me that the city is not in the pocket of the landlord.

I emailed the landlord to let them know that more bedbugs appeared after I returned. Their reply: “Those bedbugs you saw may be coming out due to the pesticide treatment. If we still see them two weeks from now then it will be a problem. That’s why I would like to wait two weeks before setting the traps in your apartment unit.”

The reporter who visited my apartment on March 21 2021 called me to let me know that he found four bedbugs in his place – not in Acton Courtyard.

The first time I returned to my place my neighbors said I looked healthier. I did notice that dark circles around my eyes were slowly disappearing. The second time I returned to 1370 University Ave. and saw bedbugs on my pillow I decided to sleep in the bathroom – sometimes in a chair and sometimes in the tub.

After a few days I noticed my feet and my lower legs started to swell up. A friend offered that my feet were swelling because I was sleeping in the chair. I had no choice but to return to my bed. To be clear: at the same time my landlord and a city employee told me that I was overreacting and just wait a couple of days and the bedbugs would be gone.

Sleeping in the Bathroom

I didn’t want to write this song

It’s just not right it so so wrong

My bed has bedbugs

Sleeping in the bathroom I need a hug

The city says it’s getting better

As bedbugs make a ladder

To get to my pillow

Eye to eye as I kill it I have no sorrow

I’ll be sleeping in the bathroom tomorrow

Scratching the itch over and over

The city says it’s getting better

As they form a ladder trying to suck my blood

I didn’t want to write this song

It’s just not right it so so wrong

My bed has bedbugs

Sleeping in the bathroom I need a hug

At night my bed they flood

Wake up in the morning and they are gone

I’m itching all day this is so wrong

Another night in the bathroom with a fat bong

Got to get high cause I can’t believe this is my life

Every month I still pay my rent on time

Slumlord I want to take your life

As The Coup’s song plays over and over

Have you tried sleeping in the bathtub

My skin I’m trying to rub

To smooth my bones as it hits fiberglass

Relief finally not scratching my ass

I didn’t want to write this song

It’s just not right it so so wrong

My bed has bedbugs

Sleeping in the bathroom I need a hug

How did it end up like this

This is some bullshit

From the bedroom to the living room

Now sleeping in the bathroom.

March 24 2021: Knock! knock! Yes it was my freakin’ landlord just now wanted to spray! Yeah no notice no nothing! I told them to send me so I can put it in my freakin’ calendar! WTF!

March 25 2021: I just want to note that yesterday March 24 2021 Acton Courtyard Apartments and the bedbug company knocked on my door to spray around my apartment. I told them to give me notice by email and to come back tomorrow. Today another knock on the door – it’s the bedbug company guy to spray. I said OK and he did. However I never got that email to reschedule. Now I need to open windows and leave for some time so it can air out!

March 29 2021: The reporter who visited my apartment on March 21 2021 called me to let me know that he found four bedbugs in his place – not in Acton Courtyard – this morning. As of March 30 2021 I have not seen more bedbugs in my apartment at this time.

I’ve lived at Acton Courtyard for just about 17 years – experiencing some good times ongoing harassment from Equity Residential and now bedbugs throwing away 95 percent of my things and risking my health. The handwriting is on the wall saying that I must continue my search for a new place to live in Berkeley!

Me and the Krip-Hop Nation that I founded have big plans and we want to continue our work in Berkeley establishing a Krip-Hop Institute and becoming the Berkeley poet laureate one day. So as you can see I must remain in Berkeley.

VALÈNCIA. (EFE) Mercadona se convirtió en 2020 en el nuevo líder del comercio nacional -y no solo del alimentario- tras completar dos décadas de crecimiento sin freno un período en el que ha multiplicado por ocho su facturación y en el que ha pasado de rozar los 500 supermercados a superar las 1.640 tiendas.



Así se desprende del análisis de los datos del pasado ejercicio presentados esta misma semana y los correspondientes al año 2000 -todavía en pesetas- cuando la firma ya había dejado de ser un operador regional y trabajaba para competir de tú a tú con los grandes de entonces.



Hace dos décadas su cuota de mercado era del 45 % por detrás del 9 % que presentaba Eroski el 6 % de Auchan y muy lejos del 23 % que registraba Carrefour entonces a la cabeza con sus enseñas Champion DIA y Pryca (nombre que desapareció ese mismo año) según un informe de la época de la Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC).



Aunque en 2020 perdió décimas de cuota -al crecer en ventas pero menos que otras cadenas- a cierre del ejercicio Mercadona rondaba el 25 % del mercado de gran consumo prácticamente la misma cifra que concentran sus siguientes cuatro rivales juntos: Carrefour (84 %) Lidl (61 %) DIA (58 %) y Eroski (48 %).



El crecimiento de la compañía presidida por Juan Roig le ha permitido adelantar a todos sus contrincantes: de las 493 tiendas del año 2000 pasó a 1.310 en 2010 y a las 1.641 actuales; sus ventas ascendían a 3.360 millones hace 20 años a 16.500 millones hace una década y se dispararon hasta los 26.932 millones en 2020.

Por delante de Inditex y El Corte Inglés

También ha evolucionado al alza su beneficio neto que aumentó de 52 a 398 millones entre 2000 y 2010 y que durante el pasado ejercicio batió su propio récord al alcanzar los 727 millones.



En un año como el 2020 marcado por la fuerte subida de las ventas en el supermercado por el trasvase del consumo del bar a dentro del hogar Mercadona ha conseguido el hito de desbancar en facturación -aunque sea de forma coyuntural por la covid-19- al otro gran gigante del sector del comercio nacional Inditex.



De hecho el grupo textil propietario de Zara sufrió en sus carnes los efectos de la pandemia y sus ingresos bajaron un 28 % hasta los 20.400 millones de euros pese a que su negocio tiene un marcado carácter internacional mientras que la actividad de Mercadona se concentra en España.



También ha logrado la cadena de supermercados derribar barreras en su pugna con El Corte Inglés por ser el mayor empleador del país dentro del sector ""retail"": ya supera los 95.000 trabajadores frente a los 88.000 del grupo de grandes almacenes que acaba además de pactar la salida voluntaria de 3.500 miembros de su plantilla.

Sin parangón en Europa

Si la comparación se circunscribe al sector supermercados la gran diferencia en cuota que separa a Mercadona de sus competidores no tiene parangón con la mayor parte de países europeos de acuerdo con los datos recogidos por la consultora Kantar.



En el Reino Unido por ejemplo Tesco aglutina el 27 % de las ventas pero Sainsbury's Asda y Morrisons oscilan entre el 10 y el 15 %; en Francia E.Leclerc encabeza la estadística con el 22 % de cuota con Carrefour siguiéndole de cerca (20 %) y Les Mousquetaires en tercera posición (16 %).



""El liderazgo de Mercadona no está en riesgo"" reconoce en declaraciones a Efe el director de Servicio al Cliente de Kantar Worldpanel para España y Portugal Carlos Cotos quien no obstante sí detecta amenazas para la firma presidida por Juan Roig.



""El éxito de nuevos modelos de negocio (operadores regionales las cadenas de 'discount' como Lidl o Aldi y el auge del comercio electrónico) presenta un reto sin precedentes para el gigante español de la distribución"" señala.

Portugal primer paso internacional

Fuentes del sector consultadas por Efe coinciden en destacar la saneada situación de Mercadona en lo que a deuda se refiere como una de sus grandes fortalezas y apuntan a su salto internacional como el gran reto a abordar por la compañía tras haber tocado techo en número de tiendas en España.



Su presidente Juan Roig admitió esta misma semana que acceder a otros países figura en los planes a medio-largo plazo de la compañía aunque advirtió de que durante ""los próximos 5 6 o 7 años"" su foco se centrará en crecer en Portugal donde cuenta con una veintena de establecimientos y prevé llegar a los 150.

El hermano de Alberto S.G. conocido como el 'caníbal de Ventas' ha declarado este viernes en el juicio que el acusado no tomaba la medicación diaria que se le había recetado para los episodios de psicosis que sufría y que le llevaron en varias ocasiones a ingresos psiquiátricos.

Su relato es clave para dar luz a los motivos que llevaron al joven de 28 años a acabar con la vida de su madre cuando le estaba preparando el desayuno. Tras cometer el crimen la descuartizó con un serrucho y comió sus restos durante días hasta que fue detenido por la Policía Nacional. El acusado afronta una petición fiscal de pena de quince años de cárcel por un delito de homicidio y cinco meses por profanación de cadáveres.

Mala relación con su madre

El hermano ha narrado que la mala relación entre el acusado y su madre se agravó a raíz de que muriera su padre en 2008 lo que provocó que su progenitora entrara en depresión y cayera en la bebida. Alberto solía reprochar a la mujer que se gastara la pensión de viudedad en alcohol.

El chico era buen estudiante pero ""fumaba porros"" e iba de botellón. Iba a la universidad y trabajaba. Con una beca se fue de Erasmus a Grecia pero el consumo de drogas le llevó a sufrir alucinaciones. Su hermano fue en su ayuda y vio entonces cómo había cambiado.

“Vivía en un mundo imaginario”

""Estaba como ido. Vivía en un mundo imaginario diciendo paranoias"" ha relatado recordando lo sucedido en la Embajada española en Grecia cuando su hermano le comentaba que les querían matar y secuestrar. Ya en Madrid tuvo diversos episodios de panaroias con ingresos psiquiátricos. Le diagnosticaron psicosis y le recetaron una pastilla diaria que no quería tomar.

El hermano ha señalado que nunca presenció maltrato físico del acusado hacia su madre quien le justificaba las marcas que tenía diciendo que se había caído. ""Tiene un carácter muy temperamental más que violento solía chillar. Había insultos y amenazas"" ha contado el testigo quien ha detallado que su madre no solía dar importancia a esas amenazas y solía dejarle estar en casa a pesar de que tenía una orden de alejamiento.

Declaración de vecinas y amigas

En la sesión ha comparecido una vecina amiga de la madre y que conocía a Alberto desde pequeño. Según su relato se cruzó con el chico después de que hubiera cometido el crimen y no sospechó nada. ""Le veía bien y guapo me sonreía. Nunca sospeché nada"" ha apuntado. Al salir de la sala le ha dicho al acusado; ""suerte"".

Otra amiga de la madre ha relatado que el joven le mandó desde la cárcel una carta en la que le pedía perdón y le preguntaba sobre su perro. ""Me voy a arrepentir toda la vida"" escribió el chico en la misiva.

Alberto S.G. relató en su declaración que tenía discusiones habituales con su madre al ser consumidor de drogas y relató que oía voces que le decían que la matara y la descuartizara",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYW5pbWFscG9saXRpY28uY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvZXN0YXMtY2FzYXMtbm8tc29uLXBhcmEtaG9tb3NleHVhbGVzLWlubW9iaWxpYXJpYS1kZS1zbHAtbmllZ2EtdmVudGEtZGUtcHJvcGllZGFkLWEtcGFyZWph0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Estas casas no son para homosexuales': inmobiliaria de SLP niega venta de propiedad a pareja,"Los vendedores de todas las inmobiliarias a las que llamaron o escribieron fueron muy amables cuando la pareja los contactó para pedir informes.

Could they compete with Comcast and Verizon?,"Mark Arnold Telecommunications Director for Kutztown poses for a portrait in front of the historic train station in Kutztown Pa. on Friday April 23 2021. President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan aims to expand internet access by building more publicly-owned broadband networks. Kutztown runs one of 200 city-wide broadband networks across the country that offer internet service. Read more

The rural borough of Kutztown couldn’t convince companies to bring faster internet to its community. So the town about 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia built its own broadband network.

Since 2000 Kutztown’s 5000 residents can buy internet service from a municipal entity just like the water and electricity they purchase from borough utilities. The publicly-owned fiber optic network has not only provided improved download speeds but has also lowered prices the town says. A private company has since slashed its rates to compete it adds.

“Whether you subscribe to the service or not you’re still benefiting from its existence” said Mark Arnold the borough’s telecommunications director.

President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan aims to expand internet access by building more such community broadband networks. The Biden administration has called broadband “the new electricity” noting the federal government worked to bring power to nearly every home under President Franklin Roosevelt because it was crucial to the economy.

Biden’s internet proposal would override 19 state laws that restrict municipalities from competing with private providers including a law in Pennsylvania that passed after Kutztown already built its network.

Biden’s plan has renewed debate over whether municipal broadband makes the internet more affordable and accessible. Advocates including Democrats in Washington argue that public networks give internet titans like Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. much needed competition. That would drive down prices and create more options.

But critics including Republican lawmakers and the cable industry say the taxpayer-funded networks are unfair competition discourage private investment and are ill-equipped to keep pace with technology.

A University of Pennsylvania study found the public projects can be money-losing operations. And Philadelphia offers a cautionary tale about how municipal internet projects can fail.

The coronavirus crisis underscored the necessity for high-speed internet as governments closed schools and offices forcing Americans to stay home. Cities such as Philadelphia scrambled to connect low income families that did not have computers or internet.

According to the Biden administration over 30 million Americans live in areas without broadband infrastructure and millions more can’t afford it because the U.S. has higher broadband prices than other countries.

At the same time more than three-quarters (76%) of Americans believe that internet service is as important as water or electricity in today’s world according to a February survey by Consumer Reports a pro-consumer group.

‘Gig City’

Biden’s plan would spend $100 billion on broadband infrastructure prioritizing support for networks run by local governments cooperatives and nonprofits. The president believes such networks have less pressure to turn profits and can commit to serving entire communities an administration official said.

“Broadly speaking I think what the president wants to do is encourage more competition” said Bharat Ramamurti deputy director of the National Economic Council. “There are a lot of parts in this country where there’s only one maybe two internet providers in the area which means that oftentimes the price is high or service isn’t as high quality as it should be.”

Chattanooga Tenn. offers a broadband success story. The city’s electric power company deployed a fiber optic network a decade ago to deliver the internet and operate a smart grid.

The utility paid for the project with a $169 million bond issue and a $111 million grant from the Obama administration which wanted to stimulate the economy after the Great Recession.

The city has been dubbed “Gig City” for offering gigabit (1000 mbps) internet speeds. More recently PCMagazine called the city something else: the best city to work from home after the coronavirus forced consumers to work remotely.

The city-owned network has never raised its prices claims to have the world’s fastest speeds and has lured tech startups to the city. A recent study from the University of Tennessee said Chattnooga’s Hamilton County received $2.7 billion in economic benefits from the infrastructure including business investments and residential bill savings.

The public network’s primary competitors are Comcast and AT&T Inc. and it’s winning the market share battle. It serves 116000 customers out of about 170000 homes and businesses in its footprint according to J. Ed. Marston head of marketing for the utility EPB formerly called the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga.

For $58 a month EPB customers can get download and upload speeds of 300 megabits per second far exceeding the Federal Communications Commission’s minimum broadband requirements. It also offers 1000 mbps for $68 per month and 10000 mbps for $300 per month the latter plan it calls “the world’s fastest internet.”

“We have to charge enough for our services to make what we’re doing sustainable” Marston said. “But we’re community based so our focus is providing the best value the best pricing that we can.”

‘Oversold solution’

Municipal broadband models widely vary. While Chattanooga’s system is city-owned other towns have built then leased their infrastructure. Others have paid private firms to build and operate community networks.

In all about 200 cities offer such citywide internet service said Christopher Mitchell director of the community broadband networks program at the Institute for Local Self Reliance an advocacy group.

Although municipal broadband has worked in places such as Kutztown and Chattanooga taxpayers can be on the hook if the expensive projects don’t work out.

Christopher Yoo a University of Pennsylvania professor of law communications and computer science studied the financial viability of 20 municipal fiber networks. He found that 11 of 20 didn’t make enough cash to cover operating costs and just two were on track to pay off the total project costs during the 30- to 40-year useful life of the systems.

“Municipal broadband is often oversold as a solution” Yoo said. “Taxpayers are sort of told this is something for nothing that it’s going to make money for the city and it’s not really portrayed as a potential burden.”

The cable industry criticized Biden’s broadband plan for prioritizing the public sector. Republican lawmakers have introduced their own proposals including one that claims to promote competition by limiting government-run networks.

“The White House has elected to go big on broadband infrastructure but it risks taking a serious wrong turn in discarding decades of successful policy by suggesting that the government is better suited than private-sector technologists to build and operate the internet” said Michael Powell president and CEO of the NCTA also known as the Internet & Television Association.

Corporations such as Comcast have worked to close the digital divide with free and low-cost service.

The company offers a $10-per-month plan for low-income customers. In Philadelphia the cable giant has partnered with the city to connect thousands of families with free home internet during the pandemic and has equipped 50 community centers with free WiFi called “Lift Zones.”

But activists and elected officials note there are still gaps in the market with people unable to access or afford an increasingly important internet connection. They argue community networks can help.

“People appreciate that this is not easy. It’s hard work. And it’s not for every city” Mitchell said. “But it needs to be the cities that decide whether or not this is the right solution for them.”

Pennsylvania’s history with broadband

In 2004 Philadelphia planned to build the largest municipal WiFi grid in the country. The ambitious “Wireless Philadelphia” project drew worldwide acclaim and envisioned over 100000 people especially its poorest residents connecting to low-cost internet.

But the endeavor failed four years later when Earthlink the private company the city chose to build and run the network pulled the plug after spending $17 million and signing up just 6000 customers. Experts now say the wireless technology wasn’t ready for the moment and the city erred in handing ownership to a private firm to avoid spending tax dollars.

A lasting legacy of Philadelphia’s failed effort is a Pennsylvania law that limits municipal broadband. Sensing government competition Verizon and other internet incumbents successfully lobbied lawmakers in 2004 to largely bar local governments from providing broadband. The law prohibits localities from offering broadband “for compensation” if a company is already operating there unless the company refuses to offer internet speeds the city is seeking.

Pennsylvania was not the first state to restrict municipal broadband but it “really ignited the monopoly movement to try to prevent cities from building networks” said Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self Reliance

Kutztown’s fiber network launched four years before the state law and is grandfathered in. The public broadband provider now serves more than half of the borough’s roughly 2500 homes.

The biggest challenge of running the network? Competing with the lower prices suddenly offered by a private company once Kutztown launched its network. “When the price war started it wasn’t as profitable” Arnold said noting it took longer to pay off the building cost.

But the whole project was never meant to be a big moneymaker he added. “It was designed to bring the services to the residents that they needed.”

PETERSBURG Fla. — Will Power will remain the most senior member of the Team Penske IndyCar team for several more years. Saturday afternoon IndyStar confirmed that the Australian driver recently signed a two-year contract extension linking him with Roger Penske and Tim Cindric until at least the end of the 2023 season.

""It's fantastic"" he said Saturday on the Peacock broadcast following qualifying for Sunday's Grand Prix of St. Pete. ""I really love being with this team. They've been very loyal to me and it's just awesome to be part of such a great organization with a great sponsor like Verizon and Chevy.""

Power confirmed earlier this year that he was entering 2021 as a contract year the same season as Team Penske was growing from three full-time cars to four with the addition of IndyCar rookie Scott McLaughlin. The arrival of the New Zealander a three-time Supercars defending champion appeared to put the futures of Power and Simon Pagenaud in precarious positions long-term. Though Pagenaud declined to address his contract situation during IndyCar Content Days when asked he is also believed to be in a contract season.

Penske has stated several times in the past that he prefers to run three full-time IndyCar entries rather than four meaning with Josef Newgarden and McLaughlin in the middle of multi-year deals the team owner and team president Cindric could be looking to downsize entering 2022 as they did following the 2017 season moving Helio Castroneves to a Month of May-only role while retaining Newgarden Power and Pagenaud. They kept that same balance until the end of last season.

Power started 2020 with six finishes outside the top-10 in his first eight races including a disappointing 14th-place in the Indy 500 after starting 22nd. His end of the season picked up with two wins over the final six races to go with another 3rd-place finish. Despite crashing out of the St. Pete finale from the pole in October he maintained his 12 consecutive years of finishing in the top-5 in the series championship -- his entire full-season Team Penske tenure that began in 2010.

With a handful of his poor races stemming from mistakes during pitstops Power told IndyStar Friday that his No. 12 Verizon Chevy team underwent a somewhat significant shakeup in the offseason to give some people a change of scenery with the addition of McLaughlin in the No. 3 car.

In particular Power changed crew chiefs from Matt Jonsson who slid onto McLaughlin's car to Joel Svensson. With Svensson Power finished second a week ago during the season-opener at Barber Motorsports Park down less than a half-second to winner Alex Palou when he crossed the finish line. It came after the previous four seasons where the 40-year-old driver had finished in the top-10 during the first four races of the year just six times.

""There's a positive feeling believe me"" Power said of the podium this week. ""We've certainly had some pretty bad starts to the season over the last few years but we've got some new guys on the car.

""It's good to bring some different perspectives in. Some people do different things in different ways and different personalities gel together and that's all that matters. On a team like this you've got to get along well.""

Fitting with IndyCar's veteran movement that includes 40-year-old defending champion Scott Dixon Power the 2014 season champ and 2018 Indy 500 winner still believes he can compete with anyone in IndyCar. Presently he has 62 poles for his career just five shy of tying Mario Andretti's American open-wheel racing record and 39 wins tied for fifth all-time with Al Unser.

The latest IndyCar news:

He's finished on the podium at the end of the year in seven of his full seasons with Team Penske but come away with just a single title.

""My goal still is to win the championship"" he said. ""It really would make me much more satisfied with my career becasue I've certainly had some close calls and felt like I should have won. And I've certainly had the speed. We've never dropped off with potential there.

""And obviously it goes without saying (winning) the Indy 500. Doing those two things would be fantastic before we're done.""

Since Marvel characters featured heavily in that (Tony Stark/Iron Man Steve Rogers/Captain America and others) we thought that this week we can have a look at the handsets seen it other superhero franchises.

We’ll start with DC of course specifically Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises (2012). It features a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic which was modified by the head of Wayne Enterprises to emit a sound pulse similar to how a bat does echolocation. But even with fictional superpowers Symbian was a goner. Nokia’s (or should we say Microsoft’s) new love was Windows Phone.

While not seen in the movie itself Nokia tried to make the best of the marketing and released a Lumia 800 The Dark Knight Rises limited edition. And we do mean limited – only 40 were made. They had the bat logo etched on the back and some multimedia content pre-loaded.



Nokia Lumia 800 The Dark Knight Rises limited edition: only 40 made

If you missed out on that one there was also the Lumia 900 The Dark Knight Rises limited edition consisting of a whopping 900 units.

T-Mobile US wanted a piece of the action and Nokia obliged by changing the back of its Lumia 710 phones with new panels that had a splash of branding. That was pretty lazy in more ways than one somehow a yellow or a pink back doesn’t make us think “Batman”.

The previous film in the trilogy also had a limited edition phone though it’s barely worth mentioning – the Nokia 6205 The Dark Knight edition was a basic flip phone for Verizon.



The Nokia 6205 Dark Knight for Verizon didn't turn many heads

Nolan left the director’s chair (but stayed on as a producer) and Zack Snyder took over for Man of Steel (2013). The Nokia Lumia 925 is featured in the trailer and there was a limited edition that premiered the day after the movie. Once again the model number dictated how many units were produced 925 in this case.



Nokia Lumia 925 Man of Steel limited edition (available only in China 925 units made)

The Nokia/DC love story didn’t end there. In 2015 Henry Cavill who plays Superman in the Snyderverse posted on Instagram that he got a new Lumia 950. Cavill has always been a bit of a geek – recently he posted a video on Instagram showing how he assembled his new gaming PC – so we’d like to think that the Lumia post was more than just corporate-mandated marketing.

Let’s shift over to the Fox franchises – technically they are based on Marvel comics but are not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

In Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) Dr. Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) is seen using a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. That was the devices official name mind you its 4.13” display (800 x 480 px) and Wi-Fi 802.11g connectivity barely qualifies it for either of those words.



The Nokia 770 Internet Tablet from 2005 was a very early attempt at the ""tablet"" concept

LG having parted ways with the MCU moved over to Fox’s new X-Men movies and paired off phones from its LG X series with some of the famous mutants. Those were pretty tenuous e.g. the LG X Style was likened to the shape-shifting Mystique and the LG X Mach to Quicksilver. Others made even less sense like LG X Power and Professor X pairing or the LG X Cam and Cyclops.



LG X phones meet the X-men

That’s enough for today but we’re not nearly done. Transformers Mission Impossible and other franchises have had interesting phone cameos too. Even Captain Kirk in the new Star Trek movies uses a Nokia – that was odd to see considering that Star Trek popularized small wireless communication devices back in the 60s long before “cell phone” was even a word (Nokia was still making rubber back then).

What is the salary of a CA in Dubai?

CA short for Chartered Accountant earns up to an average annual salary of AED 117110 in Dubai equivalent to US$326.5. The salary includes allowances for accommodation travel and other essentials.

Since Dubai is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) a Gulf nation and a conservative nation there could be disparities in salaries for males and females. That said the salaries of Chartered Accountants depend on an applicant’s work experience aptitude and few other criteria.

Of all the above measures experience plays a major role. Of course educational levels also play a vital role. For instance a chartered accountant who is a certificate or a diploma holder could earn less than those holding a bachelor’s degree or a master’s degree.

For starters CA is an in-demand profession in Dubai one of the fastest-growing in the world. The main revenue generators for this Emirate are trading retail and tourism among others.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That was the case for the Somerset Berkley varsity team on a warm April afternoon on Saturday.

The Raiders squandered several late scoring chances in the second half losing a thrilling non-league game to St. Mary’s (Lynn) 14-6 on Senior Day at Somerset Berkley Regional High School.

“It’s a game inches … it was close” SB head coach Nick Freitas said. “Some years the breaks go our way and other years they don’t. I’m proud of the kids. We battled today.”

The Spartans (4-2) took a 14-6 lead with a minute remaining in the third quarter.

Cory Riendeau took the ensuing kickoff for the Raiders and raced 53 yards to St Mary’s 36. Ali Barry made the shoe-string saving tackle for St. Mary’s.

Led by senior quarterback Brandon Medeiros SB (1-3) drove to the Spartans 1 early in the fourth quarter.

But two false start calls by the offense along with two small rushing gains and an incomplete pass gave the ball back to St. Mary’s with four minutes left in the contest.

“It is just the execution part for us” Freitas said. “We’re just shooting ourselves in the foot. It is one of those things where we have to grind it out. We have to clean up those executions.”

The Raiders had one last shot to tie the game with under a minute to play.

First Medeiros hit Patrick Kennedy for a 23 yard gain to the Spartans 39.

On second down sophomore Derick Coulanges sacked Medeiros for a 10-yard loss that pushed the back to midfield.

Two plays later on fourth down Medeiros threw a perfect pass in the middle of the field to running back Dylan Rodriguez who couldn’t haul in the tough over-the-shoulder grab between two defenders.

“They had us on that play” St. Mary’s head coach Sean Driscoll said. “It would have come down to a two-point play. We knew it was going to be a long hard-fought game. I’m proud of both programs for being able to play as they did. I’m proud of my kids. That is the second time in two weeks we had to win the game late on defense.”

Medeiros finished as the game’s leading rusher with 73 yards on 19 carries. He was 4-of-9 in the pocket for 39 yards. Medeiros scored SB’s lone touchdown in the third quarter on a one-yard keeper.

The Raiders outgained the Spartans in total yards 198-184.

“Somerset is a good program and I followed them before” Driscoll said. “Coach Freitas does a nice job in what they do. It was a battle today.”

Barry had himself a day for St. Mary’s.

He finished six-of-eight under center for 120 yards and a touchdown pass. He also added a rushing touchdown.

The Spartans punted on their opening possession.

The Raiders then drove the length on the field before getting stopped on fourth down at the St. Mary’s 7 keeping the game scoreless entering the second quarter.

The Spartans pushed across a late score with 1:45 left before halftime when Barry capped the scoring drive by plunging in from the 1. Michael Anderson added the point after to give St. Mary’s a 7-0 lead.

SB cut the deficit to one when Medeiros bulled his way in from the 1. The point after was wide.

Four minutes later Barry hooked up with David Brown near the pylon for a leaping touchdown grab and the Spartans increased their lead to 14-6.

St. Mary’s had the advantage in yards gain in a defensive first half 87-81.

That set the stage for an exciting finish.

Twenty Raider seniors and their families were honored at halftime in a small ceremony.

The sitcom revolved around a close-knit group of friends in Palisades California. Fans and viewers of Saved by the Bell eagerly watched as Zack Morris A.C. Slater Screech Kelly Kapowski Lisa Turtle and Jessie Spano navigated Bayside High School and everything that came with being a teenager. For four seasons the popular comedy aired before sadly coming to an end in 1992.

However as many of the series’ loyal fans already know a recent reboot of the show has successfully taken off. With that being said many have been reflecting on the journey and impact of Saved by the Bell as well as the original cast. Jessie Spano a fan favorite is one of the characters who returned for the reboot and fans and viewers were thrilled. Take a look back at Jessie’s character on Saved by the Bell and find out just how tall she is.

When Saved by the Bell began airing in 1989 there weren’t many characters like Jessie Spano. Elizabeth Berkley the talented and beautiful actor cast to play Jessie has opened up and shared what it was like to take on the role. On Saved by the Bell Jessie and Zack were neighbors and close friends. Jessie’s parents were divorced and it was not unusual for Zack to pop over via her window. Though she and Zack briefly dated much of Jessie’s storyline revolved around her feelings for A.C. Slater. However by no means was her character defined by her love interests.

Jessie was known to have a strong passion for dancing and singing and was an incredibly ambitious student. Ultimately this paired with her social life is what led her character to become addicted to caffeine pills during season two. This episode still stands out today for addressing a matter so deep and real. The scene and struggles were a testimony to Jessie’s strength and character. Typically the character is often remembered for being both a feminist and an activist on Saved by the Bell.

A look back at Elizabeth Berkley’s career

We caught up with the real life Jessie Spano (@ElizBerkley) about what it’s been like rebooting #savedbythebell those sparks between her and Slater (@mariolopezviva) and what OG cast members might pop into the new show. PS: you can watch season one now on @peacockTV pic.twitter.com/O08VqqQpBm — theSkimm (@theskimm) January 27 2021

Berkley a Michigan native is still fondly associated with her character Jessie Spano from Saved by the Bell. In a turn of events fans of Jessie have been enjoying getting to see her all grown-up in the series’ reboot. Nowadays Jessie Spano is no longer an exploring student at Bayside High School but actually one of the guidance counselors. Viewers of the Saved by the Bell reboot are living for this full-circle moment.

However though it is what she is typically associated with there is so much more to Berkley’s acting career. Over the years she has been cast in television series such as The L Word and CSI: Miami. Of course more recently she has been busy aiding and assisting in the hallways of Bayside High School and maybe even flirting a little with Slater Bayside High’s gym teacher.

How tall is Jessie from ‘Saved by the Bell’?

Looking ahead Berkley’s fans and followers are excited to see what Jessie Spano has in store for season two of Saved By the Bell but there is one topic of conversation from the past that keeps returning. When Jessie was a student at Bayside High School one insecurity she sometimes struggled with was her height. On-screen and sometimes in conversation Jessie would reveal that sometimes she felt too tall.

Luckily Berkley or her fictional character never seemed to let this get in the way but some people may still be wondering just how tall the actor is. When it comes to Jessie Spano Celeb Heights has revealed that she is just over 5’9″. Thinking back to Saved by the Bell Jessie’s trademark high kicks might seem to make a little more sense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNC8yNC9ob3ctbWljaGlnYW4taGlnaC1zY2hvb2wteWVhcmJvb2stc3RhZmZzLWNhcHR1cmVkLXVudXN1YWwteWVhci83MTQwNDU0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pandemic in pictures: How Michigan high school yearbook staffs captured unusual year,"Your subscription supports:

The Cupertino-based technology behemoth is collaborating with famous drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. to enable its employees to get a jab at its offices.

The company said it will roll out a website to help its workers to sign up and book appointments.

Earlier Apple encouraged all its staff to get vaccinated against the deadly disease offering paid leave to employees to get vaccinated or recover from the symptoms.

Despite these initiatives Apple has not confirmed on when it would like its employees to return to its work offices.

However Apple is not the only large organization to start such a vaccine drive. Amazon Inc. has been working on vaccinating its frontline workers since March this year. Also Facebook and Google have come up with several initiatives to aid the general public in getting access to vaccinations.

Do you think more organization should work on such initiatives? Let us know your views in the comments section below.

The combined salaries and benefits equate to $9124 for every hour of the year.

The 2021 pay is down from $87.883 million reported a year ago which included a $44 million sign-on bonus and stock awards for Suresh Komar the global chief technology officer who joined Walmart from Google in 2020.

Compensation details were released late Thursday (April 22) in the retail giant’s 120-page annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Walmart reported total revenue of $559.2 billion last year an increase of $35.2 billion or 6.7% and eCommerce sales grew 79% amid the . The stellar financials paid off well for the company’s top executives.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon saw his pay improve slightly in 2021 to $22.574 million up 2.2% from the $22.105 million reported a year ago. McMillion had a base salary of $1.272 million plus $130000 that was deferred until next year. His base salary was $1.276 million a year ago. His cash bonus of $3.816 million was incentive-based with 75% of the bonus coming from operating Income and 25% coming from sales revenue. Amid the pandemic Walmart hit its highest goals well above the maximum threshold of 125% in all of its operating segments. This produced the highest possible bonus for McMillon and the top execs.

“In addition to the solid financial performance during fiscal 2021 McMillon continued to accelerate Walmart’s transformation strategy to become the primary destination for customers by integrating our retail stores and eCommerce into a seamless customer experience” the proxy stated.

The proxy also revealed the ratio of McMillon’s compensation to the median employee income in fiscal 2021. McMillon’s $22.574 million was 1078 times that of the $20942 the median Walmart employee earned last year.

Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs had total compensation of $9.123 million last year. Biggs’ compensation grew 3.68% from the $8798491 earned a year ago according to the proxy. His cash bonus was also paid at the highest level because of the company’s strong financial metrics in fiscal 2021. His incentive-based pay totaled $1752 million up from $1.575 million in the prior year.

Suresh Kumar global chief technology and development officer at Walmart first joined the retail giant in fiscal 2020. Kumar’s total compensation was $11.737 million in fiscal 2021. His income declined from $45.898 million in the prior year which included $43.6 million in restricted stock awards that pay off over the next five years.

""We're always listening to customer feedback"" a Walmart spokeswoman said Thursday. ""They told us they wanted one pickup point and they'd prefer it be outside.""

The Bentonville-based retailer has the 17-foot towers in more than 1500 stores. They function much like giant vending machines that dispense orders customers placed online. But curbside pickup instituted about the same time as the towers outpaced them in popularity.

It's always the same: They log on the moment consoles become available at a major retailer like Amazon Walmart Best Buy GameStop or Target and then the entire stock sells out within seconds and they're left empty-handed. Demand for the Xbox Series X continues to outpace supply partially due to the due to the pandemic which has lots of people looking for entertainment options they can enjoy at home. This is also one of the reasons the PS5 was recently named the fastest-selling console in US history.

But don't give up just yet! You see in recent weeks we've been seeing more frequent inventory drops at major retailers. And the fact that retailers are announcing Series X and Series S restocks at all means that your chances of snagging a new console are getting better. The $500 Xbox Series X is the game console of choice for its 4K video and 120Hz refresh rates but if you don't have a 4K TV the all-digital Xbox Series S is an excellent system and costs a much more reasonable $300.

For the latest news on Xbox console inventory updates check back here frequently. You can monitor Xbox availability on your own too: Twitter is a popular (if not entirely reliable) source of Xbox restock rumors. But here at CNET we occasionally get an update directly from retailers and other tipsters about upcoming inventory restocks and when we do we put the word out immediately.

This much is true: It will probably be months before normal Xbox Series X stock inventory levels appear in major retailer stores so if you don't put some effort in getting your own Xbox before summer is likely to be a challenge. Microsoft recently said that it expects inventory to be short through June.

After this list of related stories you'll find a list of all the major retailers (and high-profile resellers) where you can monitor Xbox stock updates and availability.

Xbox Series X Restock Possibilities

Amazon You can find both the Xbox Series X and the less expensive Series S on the same Amazon product page. See at Amazon

GameStop This is the product page for the Xbox Series at GameStop. See at GameStop

Microsoft If you want to get the latest on the Xbox Series X there's probably nowhere better than Microsoft's own Xbox Series X homepage. See at Microsoft

Target This is Target's product page for the Xbox Series X. See at Target

Newegg This is where you can purchase the Xbox Series X at Newegg when the retailer has inventory. See at Newegg

Best Buy Here's where to find the Xbox Series X at Best Buy (when inventory drops). See at Best Buy

eBay We highly recommend waiting for inventory to appear at ordinary retailers so you can buy an Xbox Series X at the regular retail price. But if you simply can't wait be advised that the average Xbox Series X price on eBay is about $800. See at eBay

StockX Are you willing to pay a premium of hundreds of dollars over the list price? We don't recommend doing that but StockX is a reputable eBay-style site that will let you buy a new Xbox -- as long as you're willing to pay $650 or more. See at StockX

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkd2luZm8uY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkL3RoZS1iZXN0LXNhbmR3aWNoLWl2ZS1ldmVyLWhhZC1hdC13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Sandwich I've Ever Had at Walt Disney World,"I recently had what I deem to be the very best sandwich on Walt Disney World property. While I could easily justify keeping this information to myself at my core lives a person who wants to shout this news from the rooftops so that others may savor every morsel of it as well.

I must begin by saying that I enjoyed this sandwich during a 48-hour individual media event hosted by Disney. I chose this sandwich but I want to be clear that it was ultimately gifted to me. That being said as with all reviews on The DIS if I didn’t enjoy the sandwich I would not hesitate to say so regardless of who purchased what. With all of that out of the way let me say that this sandwich is art. It’s as simple as that.

I know it’s quite a thing to declare one item among so many the very best but nonetheless here I am. This sandwich found at Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort’s Dahlia Lounge stands at the mountaintop of all Disney sandwiches. And if you’ve spent time in the Magic you’ve likely had plenty of those sandwiches; Disney World’s got a million of them. This one is different.

Dahlia Lounge‘s menu features ten small plate tapas that are technically meant to be shared. That being said your mother’s not here and you can do as you wish with those tapas. Unless however your mother is in fact with you; in that case feel free to defer to her for guidance. Ahem.

Friends the sandwich that has me slobbering over the idea of making a return trip in order to have it again is the Ham and Cheese Bocadillo. This sandwich ($14) features Jamon Serrano Manchego cheese roasted garlic aïoli and honey on a toasted baguette.

The sandwich is served on a board and comes sliced into thirds. The baguette is toasted perfectly and has a lovely crunch when you bite into it. The dry-aged ham is amazing; thinly sliced while also having heft.







The chefs do not skimp on the ham which is something for which I was immediately grateful. The pairing of the Manchego cheese with the Serrano ham is a match made in heaven.

When the sandwich arrived to the table I gazed down at it and noticed that something was dripping from it. Was that olive oil? Hmmm. Upon further inspection and another glance at the description on the menu I discovered that the substance dripping from the sandwich was honey. The honey added a layer of divine sweetness to the ham and cheese and I decided then and there that henceforth all sandwiches should be served dripping oh-so-delicately with honey.







This sandwich is simple on the surface and quite complicated in the implementation. It’s just what you need at the end of a day filled with touring the Disney parks. I ate every single bite.





And the view from Dahlia Lounge’s rooftop patio that overlooks both Disney’s Hollywood Studios and EPCOT? Sigh. It’s just as perfect as the sandwich.







I cannot wait to take my husband over to the 16th floor of Gran Destino Tower so that he too can try the perfection that is the Ham and Cheese Bocadillo. But he’ll have to get his own; sharing this sandwich is simply too much to ask.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLXdva2UtY29sdW1uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Column on 'Wokeness' Ruining Disney World Experience Draws Backlash (Published 2021),"A column complaining that Disney World’s “wokeness” is ruining the fun “because Disney cares more about politics than happy guests” drew a sharp backlash online this week.

In the column Mr. VanBoskerck of North Las Vegas wrote that he was “strongly rethinking” his commitment to the amusement park and the city of Orlando Fla. home of Disney World.

Courtesy of the Model Railroad Museum

Walt Disney is well known for his groundbreaking cartoons movies and amusement parks but who knew he built a miniature railroad at his home in the Westwood area of Los Angeles?

The entertainment pioneer’s unique hobby is on display now at the recently reopened San Diego Model Railroad Museum in Balboa Park.

“The Carolwood Pacific: Walt’s Magical Railroad” is an exhibit created in partnership with the Carolwood Foundation in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park. The exhibit tells the story of Disney’s love of the railroad and how this lifelong passion influenced some of his best-known works.

In 1949 Disney started to build the 1/8-inch scale backyard railroad on weekends. He could often be found at the controls of the steam locomotive Lilly Belle or tinkering inside his little red barn which now sits in Griffith Park as a museum.

The never-before-seen exhibit was originally slated to open in November 2020 but was delayed by the pandemic. It’s part of the museum’s 40th anniversary celebration and donations are welcome.

The Model Railroad Museum is open Friday Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets can be purchased at the door or online.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA0LzI0L3N0ZXAtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1zdGFyLXdhcnMtcmVzdGF1cmFudC1pbWFnaW5lZXJpbmctZHJlYW1lZC11cC1mb3ItZ2FsYXh5cy1lZGdlLWF0LWRpc25leWxhbmQv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjQvc3RlcC1pbnNpZGUtdGhlLXN0YXItd2Fycy1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWltYWdpbmVlcmluZy1kcmVhbWVkLXVwLWZvci1nYWxheHlzLWVkZ2UtYXQtZGlzbmV5bGFuZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Step inside the Star Wars restaurant Imagineering dreamed up for Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland,"Walt Disney Imagineering dreamed up an otherworldly Twi’lek restaurant and cocktail lounge concept for Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland and Disney’s Hollywood Studios that never made the jump from page to park according to a new book on the art of the twin Star Wars lands.

The new “The Art of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge” coffee table book publishing on Tuesday April 27 gathers together hundreds of pieces of concept art created by Lucasfilm and Imagineering conceived for the Star Wars themed lands built in Disney parks in California and Florida.

Among the 256 pages of architectural character and attraction designs are more than 40 pieces of concept art for the Kalikori Club table-service restaurant once envisioned for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge.

Disneyland has not made any announcements about bringing the unrealized restaurant to the Anaheim theme park. But Imagineering never throws away any ideas and the restaurant could show up someday in some fashion in a Disney theme park.

Concept art by Lucasfilm concept design supervisor Erik Tiemens and concept artists Eddie Del Rio Khang Le Ric Lim Karl Lindberg Iain McCaig John Park Eduardo Pena and Evan Werneck show an elegant table-service restaurant and interstellar cocktail lounge located next to Oga’s Cantina.

“We had concepts for a Twi’lek club and spice den that were the same thing” Imagineering managing story editor Margaret Kerrison said in the book. “The final name we came up with was the Kalikori Club which was our idea for the table service restaurant. It was an old bath house converted into a dining establishment.”

Concept art of the two-story restaurant features an outdoor courtyard and upper level balcony. The courtyard was inspired by Domus Aurea in Rome the “Golden House” palace built by Emperor Nero in 64 AD.

The corridors and arched niches of the restaurant — which appear to have been carved from cave walls — are lined with pipes and metal plates. In one sketch water falls from broken pipes. A musical wall built into a Hoth-like carved rock room features a pipe organ with Gaudi ironwork.

Guests check in inside a boiler room filled with pipes valves and tanks that doubles as the restaurant lobby. An alien creature works the hostess stand in the boiler room lobby.

Concept art shows diners sitting on bench seats in the restaurant under curved walls with carved niches filled with ornate vases. R5 astromech droids serve as cocktail waitresses bringing drinks to customers in the lounge. Guests play hologram games at lounge tables. A backing band jams with otherworldly instruments including an alien citar. The fully-realized interiors for the restaurant and lounge include details as small as interior lighting fixtures.

Several pieces of concept art show a multi-story glowing blue aquarium housing a tentacled beast.

“Early on we thought the lobby would have a beautiful fish tank with a piece of kelp moving around in it” Imagineering creative portfolio executive Chris Beatty said in the book. “But then when you went downstairs into the cantina underneath it wasn’t kelp. It was a giant monster. It was an aquarium that had a big creature swimming in it that could be seen from multiple spaces.”

In the backstory created for the Kalikori Club the restaurant and lounge are owned by an underworld boss named Gaya.

“The table service restaurant in concept is supposed to be almost a speakeasy a hidden club” Beatty said in the book. “It is part of the under-the-underground world. It was owned by a Twi’lek proprietor. She is also the performer there. And in early concepts I think she was running the underworld. Then we ended up shifting that story. When this went away that character story line shifted to Oga Garra.”

The Chinese-American filmmaker is the first woman of colour to have won the award and only the second female winner in the ceremony’s history after Kathryn Bigelow (who won for The Hurt Locker in 2009).

Nomadland is a road movie starring Frances McDormand as a woman struggling to stay afloat in the contemporary American west.

Accepting the award from last year’s winner Bong Joon Ho who attended the ceremony virtually Zhao said: “This is for anyone who has the faith and courage to hold onto the goodness in themselves and in each other. This is for you; you inspire me to keep going.”

Nomadland is Zhao’s third film following 2017’s acclaimed The Rider and 2015’s Songs My Brothers Taught Me.

Her next film Marvel franchise blockbuster Eternals will be released in cinemas later this year.

The 93rd Academy Awards took place on 25 April having been delayed for two months due to the ongoing pandemic.

The ceremony was held primarily in Los Angeles’s famed Union Station with nominees from outside of the US attending the event via international hubs.

Among the other films competing for top awards were Emerald Fennell’s feminist revenge satire Promising Young Woman and the August Wilson play adaptation Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.

Going into the night David Fincher’s Mank had the most nominations (10) including for Best Director Best Actor for Gary Oldman and Best Supporting Actress for Amanda Seyfried.

He filed the station license challenge paperwork at the FCC Tuesday Banzhaf told B&C.

Snyder's Red Zebra Broadcasting owns seven radio stations.

Banzhaf signaled last week that he was teeing up a challenge to one or all the stations and followed through Tuesday with the challenge to Snyder's Washington outlet.

According to Banzhaf his challenge is based in part on the argument by former FCC officials and others that the term is a racial slur and that ""the unnecessary and repeated on-air use of that derogatory racist word is contrary to current federal law and akin to broadcasting obscenity."" Unlike indecency which is allowed but must be confined to the overnight hours —10 p.m. to 6 a.m.— there is no safe harbor for obscenity.

Chief among those one-time FCC officials is former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt who along with former commissioners Jonathan Adelstein and Nicholas Johnson and others also called on the FCC to convene a forum with broadcasters about whether they should ""self-regulate"" and not use the name.

Banzhaf also argues that the term constitutes hate speech and cites studies showing racially derogatory words related to Indians can cause ""real physical harm including beatings bullying and ostracism.

Banzhaf has been trying for years to get the Redskins to change their name or broadcasters not to use it but last week pointed to various recent events that have ""substantially strengthened"" the arguments he is making.

Those include a U.S. Patent and Trade office ruling that the name was offensive and the associated trademarks should not get federal protection. That happened once before prompting Banzhaf to take aim at some TV station licenses in 2005 though that did not result in licenses being pulled or the name being dropped on-air.

This time around momentum seems to be building with former FCC officials legislators and the President all suggesting it could be time for a change. Some NFL broadcasters have also signaled they don't plan to use the term and the Washington Post editorial board has banished the term from the opinion page.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9taXNzLWNvbmdlbmlhbGl0eS1oZWF0aGVyLWJ1cm5zLXNheXMtMDE1MTM0NjE3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miss Congeniality 's Heather Burns Says Fans Are 'Happy to See Me' Every Year on 'Perfect Date' April 25,"Heather Burns has become synonymous with the date April 25 thanks to her most memorable line in the Sandra Bullock-starring comedy Miss Congeniality.

""I'm very grateful for the day because it gives me a chance to connect with fans of the film and old friends. I love having been a part of something that has been meaningful for so long to so many people"" Burns tells PEOPLE.

The actress 46 also spoke about how she doesn't mind the extra attention she gets on that day which has become a beloved meme. ""I love it. It seems to each year get a little bigger even"" she told E! News.

""And it's such a nice day for me because people come out of the woodwork sending me memes and things"" added Burns who is also known for her role in You've Got Mail. ""And I go around town… people give me free coffee and you know it's just everyone's kind of happy to see me on that day.""

Burns played the wholesome and delightfully naive Cheryl Frasier a.k.a. Miss Rhode Island in the 2000 comedy about an FBI agent (Bullock) who goes undercover in the Miss United States pageant.

Fans of Miss Congeniality have created an unofficial holiday around the interview scene during which William Shatner's character Stan Fields asks Cheryl to describe her perfect date. ""That's a tough one"" she responds. ""I'd have to say April 25. Because it's not too hot not too cold. All you need is a light jacket.""

As for how she marks the day Burns also tells PEOPLE ""I usually spend April 25th walking around New York City in a light jacket enjoying the perfect weather.""

On Sunday Shatner also commemorated the day. ""Happy #PerfectDateDay!"" the actor tweeted along with the beloved meme.

Though Burns said her character ""just kind of came out of me naturally"" she also credited her mother for inspiring her. ""At the time I was so happy playing her"" she said.

""Just being in her skin made me a happier person in general but especially during that time"" Burns added. ""I mean I have such fond memories of both of those films just a joy to work on. The effect that just the sweetness of the film in general has had on a generation of fans is also really really lovely for me to experience and I'm glad that the film had an effect in that way.""

Burns also raved about working with Bullock with whom she'd later appear in Two Weeks Notice (2002) and Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005). ""She was incredibly warm"" Burns said.

By Julia Iannuzzi ’21

Food waste is a dynamic and complex issue. The issue of food waste ranges from personal to industrial; therefore there are many contributing factors such as purchasing preferences retail standards excess production cost convenience and more. According to the EPA food waste is defined as “food such as plate waste (i.e. food that has been served but not eaten) spoiled food or peels and rinds considered inedible that is sent to feed animals to be composted or anaerobically digested or to be landfilled or combusted with energy recovery.”

Food waste affects all three realms of sustainability: environmental economic and social. Food waste directly contributes to climate change because decaying food waste in landfills releases methane a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is released via the anaerobic decomposition of organic material. Food waste also contributes to food scarcity and economic difficulties because a lot of the wasted food and wasted resources used to produce the food could have been reallocated to those suffering from food insecurity. The global cost of food wastage according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2014) is $2.6 trillion per year. This cost is attributed to the wasted labor and resources that go into the food production process as well as the value of the wasted food itself. In the United States alone $408 billion worth of food goes uneaten (ReFED). As of 2018 12.9% of Maine’s population lives with food insecurity so it is fair to say that the state is acutely affected by the hardships of food waste (Feeding America 2018). Nationwide one in six Americans is impacted by food insecurity and this issue has been increasingly prevalent since the COVID-19 pandemic began (ReFED). While food waste disposal is costly management techniques for reducing or recovering wasted food offer solutions that save money. Even non-consumable food scraps such as banana peels can be composted which is a cheaper solution than traditional landfill management. The issue of food waste is more urgent and more complicated now than ever before.

Minimizing food waste is a climate change mitigation strategy that helps reduce harmful greenhouse gases. Fortunately there are myriad solutions to combat this global problem. It is important to understand the science behind the issue before tackling the solutions. The global food supply chain alone accounts for ~26% of global greenhouse gas emissions and a quarter of those emissions are due to food waste. Therefore roughly 6.5% of global emissions are a result of food waste worldwide (Poore & Nemecek 2018). In the United States food waste accounts for 4% of greenhouse gas emissions (ReFED). The food waste “ends up rotting in landfills where organic matter accounts for 16 percent of U.S. methane emissions” (EPA). Methane is a major contributor to global warming. As a greenhouse gas it is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and its atmospheric concentration has increased dramatically in recent decades. Because of the potent global warming potential of methane reduction of its emissions into the atmosphere is a major priority in our battle against climate change. Although food waste is a worldwide systemic issue it is important to recognize that solutions can be as accessible as in our own backyards.

Triple bottom line solutions to the issue will be discussed through the framework of the Mitchell Center team project “Food Waste Management: Empowering Maine Businesses Towards Sustainability.” The primary investigator for this project is Susanne Lee a former Executive-in-Residence at the Maine Business School and now a Faculty Fellow at the Mitchell Center for Sustainable Solutions. Prior to joining the Mitchell Center Lee taught an introductory course on business management and was fascinated by the course’s final topic which was sustainable business and marketing. Prior to this she had never put much thought into the crossover between sustainability and business. Upon first teaching this topic Lee was inspired by Patagonia’s sustainability efforts and she noticed that students were more engaged with this material compared to other course material. She claims “It was the best response I got from the students all [year].” This is when Lee discovered her passion for sustainability.

Since 2019 Lee has been working on a project with the Mitchell Center that focuses on solving the issue of food waste. She combines her years of experience within the business realm with her newfound interest in the world of sustainability. Mitchell Center faculty suggested that she begin working on this project to end food waste in Maine and she hasn’t looked back. “I really feel the most worthwhile use of my time and talents is to be in this sustainability area of business” (Lee).

The Mitchell Center project “Food Waste Management: Empowering Maine Businesses Towards Sustainability” takes the ‘triple bottom line’ approach in which businesses are encouraged to equally prioritize their monetary profits with their environmental and social responsibilities. This ideology is woven throughout the solutions offered to stakeholders within the project. The proposed solutions also follow the principles of reduction recovery and recycling as shown in the Maine Food Recovery Hierarchy included below.

This Mitchell Center project aims to rework the food system in Maine from a linear one to a circular one stating “linear systems are inherently wasteful because valuable inputs go in and yet the end step is a landfill” (Lee). In a linear system which is the current model there is a simple relationship from production to consumption in which the end result is waste. The goal of the circular food system is to recycle waste into a resource that can be used to create new products. In order to gain a better understanding of how this issue is being tackled within the state of Maine Lee offers a detailed look into her project. Lee’s team is collaborating with many stakeholders in Maine’s food-related industries such as grocery stores farms restaurants and hospitals. Key stakeholders include Hannaford Northern Light: Maine Coast Hospital City of Portland and the Maine DEP as well as many others.

Lee says many of the stakeholders were interested in collaborating with her and her team because they had already realized issues with their food waste management and thought there were more efficient ways to reduce waste. Six solutions were developed through stakeholder collaboration each one focusing on either reduction recovery or recycling. The solutions are:

1. Enable all Maine producers to simply measure and track all food usage

2. Create a Maine “food rescue” matching system

3. Promote statewide consumer and producer food waste education

4. Build Maine’s food handling and processing infrastructure

5. Provide producers with donation education and assistance

6. Remove food waste from landfills and support producer waste diversion.

Solution 1 encourages businesses to use pre-existing food waste tracking technology. This will make businesses aware of the money they are wasting on food that never gets consumed or goes to waste.

Solution 2 utilizes a web-based system that matches locally-available food with local food needs and volunteers to transport the food.

Solution 3 encourages consumer education and awareness about the food system and the waste that it generates. It encourages people to see the true value of the food they are purchasing. Student and consumer food waste education programs are currently in development and will be launched in schools statewide. There is a general lack of awareness of this issue so implementing educational programs in schools is an effective way to engage and educate the public.

Solution 4 aims to connect key members of the food system to create synergy among the handling and processing stakeholders. Primary issues to be addressed are transportation availability storage limitations and restrictions associated with food donation. This solution also focuses on ‘upcycling’ food that is already in the system e.g. turning local tomatoes into tomato sauce and increasing demand for canning and processing food for longer-term storage. According to Lee the food upcycling industry used to be abundant in Maine.

Solution 5 works hand in hand with solution 2 to link available food to people who are in need. The primary goal of this solution is to educate stakeholders on food donation tax incentives legal protection and offer guidance on relevant Maine governmental agencies.

Solution 6 aims to increase available options for composting and other alternatives to disposal of food in landfills. By developing better practices to divert food waste from landfills such as community practices statewide cost savings will be possible.

These six solutions are being worked on through the Mitchell Center by Susanne Lee and her team. They work with many stakeholders and are persuading business owners to adapt food waste solutions in their practices. While the project’s food waste solutions are primarily aimed at businesses they can also be easily adapted to fit our individual lifestyles. Overarching takeaways from this set of solutions are the importance of education on the issue of food waste and accessibility to landfill alternatives.

Food waste is a pressing societal issue that touches everyone around the globe and contributes to the larger issue of global climate change. Luckily there are viable solutions to reducing food waste from landfills such as those proposed by Lee’s food waste project. The solutions can be implemented on both small and large scales. Fortunately businesses benefit from the reduction of food waste economically socially and on a broader scale environmentally. Redirecting excess food towards those with limited access is helpful to communities. Reducing the amount of food that goes to waste helps businesses save money and reduces the emissions of methane a powerful greenhouse gas. Educating the public about the benefits of reducing food waste will encourage businesses and consumers to monitor their waste more closely. Everybody can be a part of the solution to food waste from large corporations to our small communities. Education is a meaningful first step.

The most memorable piece of the night was a film called “Fresh Kill” which narrates the death of an old truck. In the opening shot the vehicle chugs down a marshy road walled in by reeds. Then a more industrial landscape appears: New York’s notorious landfill Fresh Kills. We see endless trash-strewn fields edged by giant machines; colonies of seagulls standing guard under an elevated highway; a factory resting along a large bay.

Eventually the truck slams head first into the blade of an enormous bulldozer. The bulldozer flips the ruined car and presses it into the ground. Gasoline dribbles then gushes out of the tank. Like a bear with salmon the bulldozer skewers drags and tears the truck which is loaded with other trash onto a trailer carried farther into the landfill and interred. The final shots are of pools of water rimmed by garbage and plants and hot piles of waste tossing off black smoke.

Fresh Kills opened in 1948. When Matta-Clark made the film in 1972 it received roughly half of the solid waste in the city and had long been the largest landfill in the world eventually growing to about twenty-two hundred acres of trash. “Fresh Kills is a dramatic example of consumption gone wild” the environmental historian Martin V. Melosi writes in his recent book “Fresh Kills: A History of Consuming and Discarding in New York City.” Melosi an emeritus professor of history at the University of Houston is the author of “Garbage in the Cities” and “The Sanitary City”; you could call him a scholar of waste. His book which arrives nearly twenty years after Fresh Kills’s closure can be read as a companion to Matta-Clark’s film. The question for both isn’t just where our trash goes but how it shapes and reflects the world it comes from.

“New York City rarely had a day in its history without a waste problem” Melosi writes. In the late sixteen-fifties a law banned citizens from tossing “tubs of odor and nastiness” into the streets but neglected to mention what exactly they were supposed to do with their trash. Organized street cleaning wouldn’t appear until about four decades later: in 1702 authorities instructed residents to make piles of dirt in front of their homes each Friday to be removed by Saturday night. In the nineteenth century New Yorkers “dumped their trash onto the streets in anticipation of its collection by scavengers” the historian Catherine McNeur writes in “Taming Manhattan.” “Rotten food such as corn cobs watermelon rinds oyster shells and fish heads” McNeur continues “joined with dead cats dogs rats and pigs as well as enormous piles of manure to create a stench particularly offensive in the heat of the summer.” The population of New York had exploded as had the items available for consumption.

New York’s main modes of disposal into the eighteen-nineties were rendering plants hog feeding fill operations and ocean dumping. Fill operations had the virtue—at least to developers—of creating new real estate in a city bounded by water. “By the nineteenth century” Melosi writes “water lots and marsh filling added 137 acres of land to Lower Manhattan.” Streets that once ran along the water—like Water Street along the East River or Greenwich Street along the Hudson—now stand more than five hundred feet from the shore because of fill. But building out the shores also proved problematic as the new coastline began to jut into shipping lanes. Ocean dumping while easy and cheap faced related problems. Not only did it obstruct waterways defile beaches and destroy New York’s once-abundant oyster beds it reduced the depth of the deep-water harbor and threatened New York’s value as a port.

In the twentieth century incineration became the great hope for the future of waste disposal. In 1919 Mayor John Hylan proposed that a fleet of incinerators be placed throughout the boroughs. When a judge ruled in 1931 that New York City would need to end its ocean dumping—New Jersey had successfully sued the city over the trash blanketing its beaches—incineration became even more attractive. Consumerism was on the rise and a flood of mass-produced goods made disposal a priority; Melosi notes that in the ten years after the First World War the amount of solid waste the city produced rose by seventy per cent. But incinerators were expensive to repair and maintain and the pollution they produced was particularly unpopular. The tides shifted slightly back in favor of landfills.

Enter Fresh Kills which consists of a tidal inlet and salt marshes on the western coast of Staten Island. For many mid-century city planners especially those in New York any marshland was wasted space. When a landfill was proposed a supportive Robert Moses argued that it would not only create real estate but eliminate an “unsanitary mosquito breeding swamp” and “provide additions to La Tourette and New Springville . . . Parks.” The dump at Fresh Kills in Moses’s view was a humane intervention.

But Moses didn’t see Fresh Kills as a long-term solution. “Fresh Kills’ place in the disposal plans of the city” Melosi writes wasn’t originally “defined primarily as a dumpsite but largely in terms of its role as a reclamation project and complement to incineration.” The city was still hanging its hopes on the promise of new cleaner incineration technology and Fresh Kills was marketed to Staten Island as a stopgap measure. No one guessed that it would remain open for more than half a century.

Strangely it was the rise of the environmental movement in the nineteen-sixties that helped insure this longevity. The use of plastic paper and aluminum was increasing and the best way to get rid of it seemed to be burying instead of burning. While Fresh Kills was an environmental disaster too—it produced methane gas leaked millions of gallons of leachate into the groundwater cluttered waterways with split trash and exuded a miasma of foul odors—the opposition to incineration cemented the landfill’s vital role in the city’s trash system.

Landfilling is cheap and when a fiscal crisis struck New York in the nineteen-seventies the city only increased its reliance on Fresh Kills. Locals never wanted the landfill in their backyards but for the many decades prior to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opening in 1964 the population was small enough for politicians to ignore. In the nineteen-eighties the population had grown and anger over inaction began to brew on Staten Island. Locals hated the smell and potentially infectious medical waste had been found on barges heading for the landfill. Residents felt their health was at stake and agitated throughout the eighties to have the site closed. Reforms were proposed consent orders were issued yet little changed. Fresh Kills remained open.

In 1993 after years of broken promises the borough voted (roughly sixty-five per cent in favor) to secede from New York City. One major issue was Fresh Kills. The state blocked the secession but it was difficult to ignore Staten Island’s burgeoning clout and growing population. In the nineties a Republican triumvirate rode a wave of resentment into office with much help from Staten Island. Soon George Pataki was governor Rudy Giuliani was mayor and Guy Molinari was Staten Island’s borough president. Playing to their base they made an agreement to close Fresh Kills by the end of 2001. The decision wasn’t about environmental concerns and the Department of Sanitation was only alerted shortly before the announcement. “The closure” Melosi writes “was ultimately political.”

Giuliani’s solution was to increase the privatization and export of trash an expensive tactic that raided the city’s coffers and required major cuts to recycling initiatives and social programs. By 1995 New York State was the largest exporter of waste in the country sending it predominantly to Pennsylvania as well as eleven other states. This is still the basic arrangement today though Melosi shows that it’s only a temporary solution especially as the city fails to meaningfully reduce its waste. (In each year from 2013 to 2017 New York produced more than thirty-two hundred tons of waste.) He recounts the plight in the nineteen-eighties of the Mobro 4000 a barge loaded with trash from Long Island and New York City that was rejected in ports all over the planet. Exporting Melosi argues runs into the same problem as most disposal methods: no one wants trash in their back yard. As such Melosi finds New York’s trash dumps and way stations tend to be built in poor and marginalized communities that lack the political power to fight their placement.

Fresh Kills closed on March 22 2001 ahead of schedule. But history intervened and the landfill was reopened on September 12th of that year to receive the wreckage of the World Trade Center. Human remains were scattered among pulverized concrete and twisted pieces of steel; the marsh was now a landfill a crime scene and a cemetery as well. Yet Melosi renders the gruesome scene with a certain tenderness chronicling the efforts of the sanitation workers who insisted on treating the grounds as hallowed and the families who fought to claim the remains of their loved ones. It is the kind of sentiment that makes Melosi’s book important. It is neither a facile broadside about the dangers of consumption nor a simple morality tale; it is a bold examination of the way society moves and is moved by its trash.

Near the beginning of “The Great Gatsby” F. Scott Fitzgerald observes a “valley of ashes” seen out the window of a train travelling from Long Island into the city. When I first read this passage I assumed it was a hallucinatory metaphor to describe a downtrodden neighborhood. What I didn’t know was that in Fitzgerald’s time ashes made up much of New York’s municipal waste. The author was simply describing the Corona Ash Dumps in Queens an expansive constantly smoldering pile of cinder.

Trash makes for an expedient metaphor. For Fitzgerald the dump represented a subjugated wasteland where nothing grew. For Melosi waste reveals the still-unresolved dilemmas of unimpeded consumption. But landfills aren’t just a record of what society discarded they’re a record of what a society considered trash. What constitutes our waste changes and with it our understanding of the world.

Today Fresh Kills is no longer a landfill. A more “abstract and theoretical” park in Melosi’s words is planned to take over the site rebranded as the less-hostile “Freshkills.” If completed—it has been in the works since 2008—it will be larger than Central Park. Most of the area is closed to the public but one can catch sight of it off of New York State Route 440 where enormous and bald hills dotted with methane-exhaust pipes loom over the highway. The brown grassy hills bordered by small dogwoods and tawny drooping phragmites are not especially beautiful. Yet when you consider what is contained inside these hulking hills you might stop to marvel. They are burial mounds perverse feats of engineering and as Melosi writes “archives of material and memories.” We typically experience trash only at the point of disposal. Here near yet far is its final resting place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRuai5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L21pZGRsZS1wb2ludC1sYW5kZmlsbC1zb2xpZC13YXN0ZS1jb21wYW55LXJ1dGhlcmZvcmQtY291bnR5LXRuLzczNDk3NDEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What 9 solid waste companies are vying for Rutherford County business?,"Rutherford County officials are examining the competing solid waste companies about proposed services.

At a recycling plant in Swindon 80 miles west of London an experiment to turn used plastics into oil is under way. If successful the portable “chemical recycling” plants used in the process — designed to fit into shipping containers — will one day be sold worldwide.

Some 350m tonnes of plastic a year are produced globally with production forecast to triple by 2050 and account for a fifth of global oil consumption according to research company Statista.

Driven by pressure to cut the world’s reliance on finite fossil fuels chemical recycling pioneers hope that producing oil from plastic waste will provide an alternative source of hydrocarbons.

“Chemical recycling of plastics is a niche solution but it is getting extraordinary attention from the largest petrochemical companies and consumer brands” says Ben Dixon head of circular materials at Systemiq a consulting and investment group. “Does this herald the start of a revolution? Quite possibly — ultimately that depends on developments in the technology and economics of recycling wider developments in the waste system and regulatory support for this nascent industry.”

The Swindon plant is operated by Recycling Technologies a UK business that employs about 130 staff and has raised nearly £40m in equity and grant funding since its creation a decade ago.

Recycling Technologies’ plant uses pyrolysis a process in which polymers are broken down with extreme heat. Its RT7000 machine heats mixed plastics in the absence of oxygen — a process known as “cracking” — to produce gas. Through distillation this vapour is turned into products ranging from heavy wax and oils to light oils and gas. These can provide the building blocks for new polymers or be used as fuel.

An RT7000 can turn 7000 tonnes of plastic — including hard-to-recycle waste such as polystyrene and flexible packaging — into 5250 tonnes of liquid oil called Plaxx annually. Recycling Technologies sends 70 per cent of its Plaxx to Neste a Finnish producer of sustainable fuel and plastic feedstock. The remaining 30 per cent of the Plaxx is used as a wax equivalent to make candles and paint while the leftover gas and char are consumed as energy sources within the process.

Adrian Griffiths founder and chief executive of Recycling Technologies hopes to expand operations beyond Plaxx production and sell RT7000s to waste companies globally plus management and support services. He believes the technology could help displace virgin oil in plastics manufacturing.

“In Europe there is now a fiscal stimulus to make sure it doesn’t matter what the price of oil is if there is a significant demand for recycling plastic back into the oil” he says. “The problem with this is Europe represents only . . . a small part of the global picture. Our ambition is to get the capital costs down . . . by mass producing that machine.”

But environmental groups query the green credentials of chemical recycling given its energy use and end products.

“A lot of projects and facilities claim they do chemical recycling but if you look at what they do with the output — the final oil-based product that comes out — it is sold as a fuel so it is not even recycling” argues Sander Defruyt head of plastics at the Ellen MacArthur foundation a non-profit group focused on the circular economy.

According to consultancy McKinsey however pyrolysis has a lower carbon footprint than plastic incineration even if its energy use is not insignificant. Also customers have shown a willingness to pay extra for recycled products — so not all the end-product will become fuel.

“There is a significant green premium in the market today with prices for recycled polyethylene above the price of virgin [oil-based] resin” says Jeremy Wallach a partner at McKinsey’s chemicals practice. “While the recycled oil can be blended into fuels and burnt (as diesel) its potential higher value in plastic applications linked to ‘green premium’ suggests plastics will be a primary outlet as the industry scales up.”

The Swindon plant is one of a growing number of facilities seeking a viable method of turning plastics into substances of value.

Mura Technology a British plastics recycling group is building a plant in Teesside north-east England that uses a hydrothermal process called HydroPRS. This works by injecting steam into mixed plastics allowing the heat to spread evenly and quickly. Mura’s process converts waste plastic into naphtha distillate gas oil heavy gas oil and heavy wax residue. It also creates a gas that powers the machine’s boilers.

Waste plastic can be converted into feedstock used to make new polymers

Steve Mahon Mura’s founder and chief executive says its products cost the same as those made from fossil fuel.

Nevertheless big obstacles — scalability poor waste collection infrastructure high set-up costs and uncompetitive pricing when crude oil is cheap — must be overcome to make this recycling viable.

With a green premium the economics of chemical recycling begin to decouple from oil

“Without a green premium oil prices above $65 per barrel are likely required to justify the investment economics” says Wallach. “However with a green premium the economics of chemical recycling begin to decouple from oil and can be attractive at lower oil prices.”

Griffiths points to the renewable energy sector as a model for how the chemical recyclers might scale up.

“Like with solar and wind there was a time when the cost of installation was never going to compete with power stations” he says. [So you had] contracts for difference and feed-in-tariffs. You don’t need those any more because wind and solar are below the levelised cost of electricity.” Chemical recycling he says “is going to be exactly the same thing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdW1haW5lLmVkdS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS8yMDIxLzA0LzI1L3BhbmRlbWljLXRyYXNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Current State of UMaine's Waste and Recycling Process: Pandemic Edition - Office of Sustainability - University of Maine,"Current State of UMaine’s Waste and Recycling Process: Pandemic Edition

By Sydney Abramovich ’21

According to the EPA as of 2017 over 32% of the nation’s municipal solid waste or MSW is actually composed of cardboard paper and plastics. Before the COVID-19 pandemic shook the world many campuses businesses and lawmakers were working to reduce the amount of single-use plastics utilized by consumers. Since the pandemic has created a need to avoid sharing this progress is being unraveled as single-use plastics are once again growing in popularity. On UMaine’s campus the once-easy act of going to a dining hall salad bar and picking food with tongs has been replaced with many pre-packaged food options and additional plastic containers. Alongside this many students and faculty are using disposable masks and gloves in order to protect themselves from pathogens. These are just a few examples of COVID-19 trash but it prompts the question: where is all of the single-use plastic on campus going after we are finished with it? The campus waste stream is now facing an influx of single-use materials.

When looking at UMaine’s waste management system it is important to recognize the two waste streams: recycling and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In terms of recycling a state law passed in 1995 requires that UMS campuses must recycle paper cardboard and glass at a minimum and this can be found in Maine Legislation’s Title 38 § 2137. The university currently holds a contract with Casella Waste Systems in which their zero-sort system recycles the required materials as well as aluminum plastic bottles paper plates and cups and some empty food containers (umaine.edu/sustainability/initiatives/recycling). Unfortunately items like styrofoam batteries and plastic bags are not-recyclable. Jim Dunning the assistant general manager of Casella was able to provide some information about where these materials end up. He says “After the sorting is all done we transport the rest of the materials to Juniper Ridge landfill in Alton which is a state-owned landfill. We try to take as much out as possible before this happens.”

It is also worth noting that not everyone knows what can and cannot be recycled so some recyclables end up in municipal waste as well. Since the UMaine campus is located in Orono we are required by law to follow the same MSW disposal processes as the town and this led to the campus working with Coastal Resources of Maine LLC (CRM) for its MSW processing.

Formed in 1991 the Municipal Review Committee (MRC) is a non-profit membership organization composed of 115 Maine municipalities of which Orono is one. The MRC sought to restructure long-term agreements for MSW disposal at a waste-to-energy plant in Orrington Maine known as the Penobscot Energy Recovery Company (PERC) facility. In 2007 the MRC Board began a process for evaluating alternative arrangements for managing MSW after March 31 2018 when the disposal contracts with PERC were scheduled to expire. Through a competitive process beginning in 2013 the MRC selected Fiberight to develop a new MSW processing facility that would utilize proprietary and innovative technology. The MRC purchased a site in Hampden where the facility could be constructed. CRM is the project company formed by Fiberight to finance own and operate the Hampden project. MRC owns the land on which the Hampden facility sits and leases the property to CRM.

At the Hampden facility CRM uses the Fiberight process to support their mission which is to repurpose and recycle as much MSW as possible in a closed-loop fashion. It has been proven that the Fiberight process can divert 60-80% of MSW from landfill instead of the usual 10-30%. Shelby Wright the director of community services at CRM explained how the Fiberight technology works: “We use a seven-step process that sorts items and from there we can make glass into value-added products convert organic wastes into renewable natural gas pulp paper products and make some of the less valuable materials into bricks that can be burned for energy.” When looking at the hierarchy of waste management reusing and recycling sit high on the chart while landfilling and waste-to-energy sit at the bottom. According to the Department of Environmental Protection Maine’s MSW recycling rate was at 36.8% as of 2016 and companies like CRM could help increase that percentage with the Fiberight process. Unfortunately financial stresses in part due to COVID-19 put CRM into a shutdown as of late May 2020. The MRC is currently in talks with an interested party based out of Pennsylvania Delta Thermo Energy and other stakeholders about getting the Hampden facility up and running again. A deal with Delta Thermo Energy is expected by June 30 2021.

With CRM’s closure Orono and the university were obligated to temporarily send their MSW to a local landfill (Crossroads Landfill in Norridgewock) until PERC agreed to receive the waste. PERC uses an industrial incinerator to burn MSW and produces electricity for residents in mid-coast Maine. Their process is effective in reducing the amount of trash entering landfills but incinerating disposable plastics such as food containers and masks can release harmful chemicals and fossil carbon into the atmosphere. Dunning mentioned that after PERC incinerates they have large volumes of ash as a byproduct and Casella uses this ash as a landfill cover at Juniper Ridge. Although landfilling and incineration are not the most environmentally efficient forms of waste management this interaction shows resourcefulness and cooperation.

When taking this all into consideration there’s clearly many stakeholders and systems involved with the transportation and processing of UMaine’s recycling and MSW. These systems are complex and the content of our MSW and recycling has been changing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Wright and Dunning mentioned that waste companies are seeing a substantial increase in cardboard and single-use containers as a result of COVID-19 as more people are online shopping and using extra plastic packaging to keep contamination to a minimum. Since the disposable masks and gloves we see on a daily basis are not typically recyclable they are most likely being incinerated at PERC or sent to the Crossroads Landfill. Personal protective equipment was not being discarded in such high volumes previously so the recent widespread increase in use has left MSW and recycling plants with an unusually large amount of disposable PPE to handle. At the end of the day there are still many hurdles society needs to overcome in order to create a more sustainable waste management system like finding ways to process hard-to-recycle materials. COVID-19 is not making this any easier. Hopefully COVID-19 will subside and efforts to reduce and repurpose waste can continue to move in a more positive and sustainable direction."

A letter to account holders dated March 12 from PNC Bank indicated that the branch at 240 Main Ave. Hawley will close on June 11 2021.

Operations of the Hawley branch will be combined into the Viewpoint Mall branch located at 100 Viewmont Mall Drive in Dickson City.

PNC Bank’s ATM machine at the Turkey Hill Minit Market located just outside Hawley across from the Wallenpaupack Area High School will still be available.

“At PNC Bank we continuously evaluate our ability to assist you in achieving your financial goals and we strive to provide you with convenient banking options” Travis Branch Retail Market Executive states in the letter.

“Today customers have more service choices than ever before and are using branches very differently. With this in mind we have carefully studied the effectiveness of our branches based on their physical capacity as well as the number of customers who frequent each location.”

The location is scheduled to permanently close at 3 p.m. on Friday June 11.

Marcey Zwiiebel PNC Corporate Communications said that more customers are taking advantage of online transactions. During the first quarter of 2021 ending in March she said 79% of their customers company-wide did their banking online rather than go to a teller. This was up from 71% in the first quarter of 2020. She said there has been a “pretty steady increase” over the last several years.

She said they are happy to help their customers to know how to take advantage of their services online and know what options they have.

American Banker and other media outlets reported in September 2020 that Chairman and CEO William Demchak PNC Financial Services Groups Inc. that PNC planned to close 80 to 90 branches by the end of 2020 and another 120 in 2021. The reason cited was the move by more consumers to adopt online banking which has been accelerated by the impact of the spread of COVID-19.

There are roughly 2200 branches of the Pittsburgh-based company Zwiiebel said. They are primarily in the eastern southeastern and mid-western states.

New branch offices are also planned she said in areas of the country where PNC is expanding.

She said that when a branch is closing typically PNC does their best to place their impacted personnel in other locations.

In 2015 the PNC branch in Newfoundland Wayne County closed and consolidated with the Hawley branch. The Newfoundland branch building is now a lawyer’s office. PNC maintains an ATM in Newfoundland.

Anita J. Baldwin-Cotti commented on Facebook about the old Hawley Bank building “Has it ever been registered as a historical landmark? Please make sure it doesn’t get destroyed!”

""I am impacted by the closing of PNC"" John Troulis of Hawley said. I run a couple businesses and I sometimes need to go inside instead of just running through the Drive Thru.""

PNC Bank has occupied the facility at the corner of Keystone and Main for several years having purchased it from First Eastern Bank; it is thought to have been around 1994-1995.

Hawley Bank opened in 1911 in another location and opened for business in their newly built facility at 240 Main October 5 1929. In 1986 the shareholders of Hawley Bank agreed to merge with First Eastern Bank David Swingle who worked at Hawley Bank recalled.

It is not known what will become of the landmark banking facility.

Another downtown landmark bank the 1st National opened in 1902 diagonally across the street from where Hawley Bank would later build its facility. The former 1st National Bank which also changed ownership by financial institutions a few times is now a restaurant.

The only other bank in downtown Hawley is The Dime Bank Hawley branch.

There are other branch offices for The Dime Bank Wells Fargo Wayne Bank and Honesdale National Bank within about two miles from Hawley Borough along Route 6 between the borough line and the Wallenpaupack Area High School.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvYmFuYy1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXBsYW5zLW1ham9yLXB1c2gtbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banc of California Plans Major Push Into LA Market,"Santa Ana-based Banc of California Inc. which in March agreed to buy local rival Pacific Mercantile Bancorp in a stock transaction valued at $235 million is planning to make a big play in Los Angeles.



The bank is looking to establish a significant corporate presence in the market starting with new digs in Brentwood that will serve as a base to pursue more L.A. business.



“We are migrating more toward Southern California and the westside of Los Angeles versus Orange County” said Jared Wolff president and chief executive of Banc of California. “The bank is technically headquartered in Santa Ana and I’ve taken office space in Brentwood and our name is going on top of a pretty big building there.”



Banc of California which has about half of its 29 branches in Los Angeles County has leased space at a 10-story tower located at 11611 San Vicente Blvd. with its signage expected to occupy a prominent position in a few months. The space will primarily serve as corporate offices for Wolff and senior executives with a branch on the fifth floor.



Wolff who joined the bank in March 2019 has assembled a tightly knit team of executives including several from his former employer Beverly Hills-based PacWest Bancorp.



While at PacWest Wolff was directly involved in 20 acquisitions between 2002 and 2014 in various roles the last as president of the Pacific Western Bank unit.



Other executives brought into Banc of California by Wolff hail from the top ranks at Wells Fargo & Co. and MUFG Union Bank.



Another strategic hire Alex Kweskin formerly managing director of human resources with the $132 billion-in-asset MUFG Union Bank plans to join Banc of California on May 3 as executive vice president and chief human resources officer.



“Technically our headquarters is still where it is in Orange County. There’s a regulatory process that we’ve got to go through to move our headquarters” said Wolff who lives in Santa Monica and told his bank’s board of directors at the time of his hiring in May 2019 that he’d only commute for one year.



“I think our bank has not done a great job of being as present as we could on the westside (of L.A.)” Wolff said. “So we’ve obviously been increasing our presence since I’ve gotten to the bank here and we’ll continue to do that.”



Joining Wolff in shuttling between the bank’s dual headquarters in Brentwood and Santa Ana will be several senior executives including Lynn Hopkins executive vice president and chief financial officer of Banc of California; Jay Sanders president of private and specialty banking (who has an office in Century City); Robert Dyck chief credit officer; Ido Dotan executive vice president and general counsel; Hamid Hussain president of real estate and commercial banking; and John Sotoodeh president of community and business banking.



Wolff worked with Dotan on M&A deals for PacWest when Wolff was at PacWest and Dotan was at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. Dotan followed Wolff to Banc of California in May 2019.



Hopkins was the chief accounting officer during Wolff’s tenure at PacWest and later the CFO. She moved to Banc of California in May 2019.



Dyck who was chief credit officer with PacWest during Wolff’s tenure joined Banc of California in September 2019.



Orange County questions



With the new Brentwood home in the works the future of Banc of California’s corporate headquarters building in Santa Ana is in question.



The bank paid $76.4 million to buy the posh 10-story property at 3 Macarthur Place for its headquarters in late 2015 about a year before it fully moved in from leased facilities around Orange County.



“The bank well that was before I got there bought a building in Orange County and created a monstrous building there that has our name at the top” Wolff said. “The building is primarily occupied by Banc of California but it is leasing some of the other floors.”



About a quarter of the building’s 260000 square feet is empty industry sources said.

“I don’t think owning real estate that size is a good idea for our bank and so we will look at ways to be opportunistic about how we use our real estate” Wolff said.



“I’m not making a statement that we shouldn’t have a large presence in Orange County. I’m making a statement that we are going to continue to increase our presence in Los Angeles. And separately from that a bank our size doesn’t need to own a $100 million building in Orange County. If there are ways to unlock that capital then we would look at ways to unlock that capital” he added.



Some branches potentially from both banks will be shuttered as some of Pacific Mercantile’s branches overlap with Banc of California’s markets.



The leased space at 949 South Coast Drive in Costa Mesa that serves as Pacific Mercantile’s headquarters is roughly 3 miles from Banc of California’s headquarters — offering Wolff another opportunity to consolidate.



“There’s a large branch overlap. They have three branches so you know if you have branches in the same communities it doesn’t make sense to have both and we’re going through the analysis now of what will best serve our combined clients. And so we’re making those decisions in due course” Wolff said.



“In terms of people there’s a lot of great people at (Pacific Mercantile) and we’re going to need those people to continue to serve the clients and we haven’t made any final hiring decisions yet. But you know we’re going through that process now of figuring out who the best fit is long term” he added.

Acting U.S.­ Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams said Cushmir McBride 21; Kamar Thompson 34; and Nasser McFall 22; hatched a plan to rob a Target in Port Richmond and then went on to set off three more bombs at Wawas in Philadelphia and Claymont Delaware. They took advantage of unrest in Philadelphia after police shot to death Walter Wallace Jr. Williams said.

WARNING: This video contains graphic violence harsh language and a man’s death. A pair of videos showing two Philadelphia police officer’s encounter with Walter Wallace Jr. on Oct. 26 2020 were released by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office in conjunction with the Mayor’s Office Philadelphia police and Wallace’s family on Nov. 3 2020. We are showing all of the body-worn footage released by officials without editing for transparency. Viewer discretion is advised.

The trio first set off explosives at the Target on October 28 2020 blowing up an ATM and then stealing the cash according to prosecutors. They did the same thing the next day at a Port Richmond Wawa before attempting two more robberies by setting off explosives at another Philadelphia Wawa and then one in Claymont authorities said.

“If you engage in violence and commit a federal crime during periods of civil unrest hoping the turbulence will afford you some cover rest assured that it will not. As this Indictment shows we will find you charge you and you will face the consequences of your actions in federal court” Williams said in a statement.

McFall is also charged with setting off an explosive device in an ATM at a Philadelphia Wells Fargo in December.

Photos by SFYIMBY show that construction has topped out glass installation is underway and facade installation is being prepped for the residential complex.

Van Meter Williams Pollack is the architecture firm managing the design concept and construction. Hill Associates is the landscape architect.

950 West El Camino image by Andrew Campbell Nelson

The project site is a 0.61-acre parcel previously occupied by a Taco Bell. Named Luna Vista the project features 71 housing units offering independent living for a mix of single and two-person households earning between 50% to 70% of the area’s median income. The developer has reserved fifteen units for adults with special needs. On-site amenities are inclusive of a roof-top deck a community room with a kitchen a conference room a library and a laundry unit. Outdoor lounges on the second third fourth and fifth floors are also designed. The complex will also have a bicycle parking space and a storage locker available for each resident.

Alta Housing is also providing on-site management and services to residents including case management resident engagement educational assistance health and wellness programs financial planning courses job counseling and assistance with accessing community resources.

The project has secured funding from the City of Mountain View Wells Fargo Bank and Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Acquisition funding was provided by the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley.

The property is situated centrally on El Camino a block north of Downtown Mountain View. Its location benefits residents especially without a car as the property is located within a quarter-mile of bus stops for VTA 22 52 81 and 522.

The 950 team wanted public art to connect the building future residents and the Mountain View community so they reached out to the Morgan Autism Center and the Mountain View Community Arts Organization to help. Clients at the Morgan Center who could one day be residents at 950 ECR agreed to make art for the team to use. Their colorful and bold artwork which includes 64 pieces was photographed and printed on glass panels that will be in entryway and lounge spaces. Sunlight will cast the shadows of these works on the floors in the lobby and lounge spaces.

The estimated date of project construction has not been announced yet.

The construction is set to begin this year with the production of DRAM chips with 10-nanometer class process technologies slated for 2024.Nanya is the world's fourth-largest DRAM chipmaker holding a 2.9% market share in the DRAM market as of the fourth quarter of 2020 according to market research firm TrendForce. There is a considerable gap between Nanya and industry leaders Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. with 42.1% and 29.5% market shares respectively.Nanya is likely to have decided on a large-scale investment because the DRAM market is growing at an extremely fast pace -- making it difficult for Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to dominate the market which is projected to grow from $65.3 billion last year to $104.4 billion in 2022.Nanya plans to utilize extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology to narrow its gap with the market leaders.In the NAND flash segment US chipmakers Western Digital and Micron have been pushing to expand their foothold in the market as they both consider acquiring the world’s No. 2 NAND flash company Kioxia Holdings.As of Q4 2020 Samsung Electronics was in the lead with a 32.9% market share in the NAND flash market followed by Kioxia with 19.5% Western Digital with 14.4% SK Hynix with 11.6% and Micron with 11.2%.If Western Digital merges with Kioxia then the company would exceed Samsung Electronics' market share and position itself as the industry frontrunner.Meanwhile US-based semiconductor foundry GlobalFoundries Inc. has been stepping up investment despite the global foundry market's supply shortage.Industry watchers say the US administration's initiative to foster semiconductors served as a driving force behind the company's decision.GlobalFoundries plans to inject around $1.4 billion this year to increase production in its US Singapore and Germany-based plants.

Onda Unleashes A Motherboard Offering 32 SATA HDD & SSD Storage Ports Dedicated For Chia Coin Cryptocurrency Mining

Manufacturers are already working to offer Chia Coin dedicated mining SSDs and it looks like motherboards are getting dedicated mining versions for the cryptocurrency too. The board in question is the Onda B365 D32-D4 Magic Edition which features a total of 32 SATA ports that supports up to 32 SATA-based HDD and SSD storage devices.

The motherboard is based on the Intel B365 chipset and features four DDR4 DIMM slots and a single PCIe Gen 3.0 x16 and PCIe 3.0 x1 slot. The board measures at a massive 530mm x 310mm and power are provided to the motherboard through a 24-pin ATX and a dual 8-pin connector configuration for the CPU. Technically what you are looking at is an mATX motherboard with an extended PCB to support all the SATA connections. I/O includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports 1 USB 2.0 4 USB 3.0 a VGA & HDMI port and power on/off buttons.

As per the details provided by Onda the motherboard has a total of six 6-pin connectors to power the SATA ports. The SATA ports can hold up to 448 TB storage capacity in either HDD or SSD NVMe standards.

The mining process of Chia Coin requires a large amount of free space and runs several reading & writing operations. In this case endurance (TBW) is equally as important as speed so consumer SSDs aren't the best choice for mining due to their lower endurance and running these operations will significantly reduce the lifespan of an SSD. Hence the target for these miners is primarily hard drives and data center SSDs. This motherboard could be a huge hit since Chia Coin mining is becoming more popular in the Asian Pacific region.

The Chia Coin Cryptocurrency has seen a large share of storage devices dedicated towards it which has prompted the rise in HDD prices across China. Tomshardware has a table which illustrates just how much the prices have risen over the last week:

Hard Drive Price Increase Current Price Lowest Price (1 week ago) Western Digital WD Gold 18TB 40.4% $1231 $877 Seagate Exos X18 18TB 66.7% $1077 $646 Seagate SkyHawk AI 18TB 39.4% $923 $662 Seagate Exos X16 16TB 60.6% $816 $508 Seagate IronWolf 16TB 56.2% $814 $521 Ultrastar DC HC550 16TB 30.3% $662 $508

There's no word on the pricing of this motherboard but it is already being sold directly to miners who are using this to build up their Chia Coin cryptocurrency inventory.

With the advent of OS X El Capitan Apple made a few changes to how the Disk Utility First Aid feature works. The main difference is that First Aid will verify the selected drive and automatically attempt to correct any problems. Before El Capitan you could just run the Verify process on its own and then decide if you wanted to attempt repairs.

This article applies to the First Aid feature on OS X El Capitan (10.11) and later. Use these instructions to use Disk Utility on OS X Yosemite (10.10) and earlier.

Disk First Aid and the Startup Drive

You can use Disk Utility's First Aid on your Mac’s startup drive. However you're limited to only performing a verification of the drive while the operating system is actively running from the same disk. If there's an error First Aid will display it but won't attempt to repair the drive.

If you're checking a Fusion drive you must start up with OS X 10.8.5 or later. Use the same version of OS X installed on your current startup drive.

To get around the problem start up from your Recovery HD volume or another drive with a bootable copy of the operating system installed. The two methods are similar; the main difference is the need to boot from another volume instead of your normal startup drive.

First Aid From a Non-Startup Volume

Here's how to use Disk Utility's First Aid on a non-startup volume.

To quickly access Disk Utility when you need it add it to the Mac Dock.

Launch Disk Utility

Use Spotlight (Command + Spacebar) to Launch Disk Utility or find it from /Applications/Utilities/.

The Disk Utility window appears as three panes:

Button bar : Across the top of the window is a button bar containing commonly used functions including First Aid.

: Across the top of the window is a button bar containing commonly used functions including First Aid. Mounted volumes : On the left is a sidebar that displays all the mounted volumes connected to your Mac

: On the left is a sidebar that displays all the mounted volumes connected to your Mac Main pane: On the right is the main pane which displays information from the currently selected activity or device.

Select the Volume

Use the sidebar to select the volume you wish to run First Aid on. The volumes are the items just below a device's primary name. As an example you may have a Western Digital drive listed with two volumes below it named Macintosh HD and Music.

The right pane displays information about the selected volume including size and amount of space used.

Run First Aid

With the volume you wish to verify and repair selected:

Click the First Aid button on the top pane and select Run to start the verification and repair process. You can also select and right-click the volume name in the left pane and select Run. Select the triangle in the lower-left corner of the dialog box to expand details.

The details reveal the verification and repair steps as they're taking place. The actual messages displayed vary by the type of volume being tested or repaired. Standard drives may show information about catalog files catalog hierarchy and multi-linked files while Fusion drives have additional items checked such as segment headers and checkpoints. Once the first aid process ends you'll see a green check mark and a message that confirms the process is complete. Choose Done to exit.

Repairing Drives

Some notes on what to expect when using First Aid to repair a drive:

If First Aid reports no issues : If First Aid indicates that the drive appears to be okay or that repairs are complete you're done. In some previous versions of First Aid it was necessary to run the repair process multiple times to ensure the repairs were complete; that is no longer required.

: If First Aid indicates that the drive appears to be okay or that repairs are complete you're done. In some previous versions of First Aid it was necessary to run the repair process multiple times to ensure the repairs were complete; that is no longer required. If First Aid displays an ""overlapped extent allocation"" error : Disk Utility will create a DamagedFiles folder at the root level of your startup drive. The overlapped error indicates that two (or possibly more) files occupied the same location on the drive receiving repair. More than likely both files have become corrupt but there's a slight chance you can recover one or both of them.

: Disk Utility will create a DamagedFiles folder at the root level of your startup drive. The overlapped error indicates that two (or possibly more) files occupied the same location on the drive receiving repair. More than likely both files have become corrupt but there's a slight chance you can recover one or both of them. You can examine the files in the DamagedFiles folder . If you don't need the file or you can delete the file and easily recreate it. If you must have the file then check your backup for a usable copy.

. If you don't need the file or you can delete the file and easily recreate it. If you must have the file then check your backup for a usable copy. If First Aid reports a failure : ""The underlying task reported failure"" message indicates that it failed at making the needed repair. However don't give up; try rerunning the repair a few times.

: ""The underlying task reported failure"" message indicates that it failed at making the needed repair. However don't give up; try rerunning the repair a few times. If repairs aren't successful: As long as you have a backup of the data stored on the affected drive reformat the drive and perform a clean installation of your operating system version. You can then restore your backup data using the Migration Assistant.

Boot From the Recovery HD

To use the Recovery HD method use these complete step-by-step instructions to boot from the Recovery HD volume and start Disk Utility.

Once you have successfully restarted from the Recovery HD and have launched Disk Utility you can use the method for using First Aid on a non-startup drive to verify and repair the drive.

The project is planned for a 36-acre site just south of the intersection of West Marietta and Herndon Streets and on the west side of the planned Atlanta BeltLine Trail extension.

A submission with the state’s Department of Community Affairs outlines plans for a 1.15 million-square-foot data center 640000 square feet of office space 70000 square feet of retail and 450 units but filings this month with the city call for 900000 square feet of data center space 250000 square feet of data center offices 40000 square feet of office 70000 square feet of retail and 400 units.

A spokesperson for QTS Data Centers said the company would decline to comment at this time.

Plans with the city show that QTS intends to build 350 for-rent units in a mixed-use building southeast of the intersection of West Marietta and Herndon Streets and 50 townhomes down the eastern side of Herndon Street. To the northeast would be a mixed-use office and retail building while the southern portion of the project would hold two data center buildings along with offices.

The site has held the former WestRock packaging facility and was acquired by West Midtown Acquisition Company LLC a subsidiary of Kansas-based QTS in 2018 for $80 million.

Plans show that 35 of the project’s for-rent units would be reserved for households at 60 percent of area median income or below. Projected below-market-rate rents for the units are shown as $750 for studios $960 for one-bedrooms and $1800 for two- and three-bedroom units.

The total unit mix is 118 studios 117 one-bedrooms and 115 twos and threes with expected market rents of $1250 $1600 and $3000.

The project’s for-sale component would feature 25 three-bedrooms with an expected average sales price of $425000 and 25 four-bedrooms with an expected average sales price of $525000.

Access to the development would be provided from both West Marietta Street and Herndon Street with pedestrian connections to the BeltLine Trail provided by multiple locations within the site.

The project was presented in January to the city’s Concept Review Committee by QTS Development Program Manager Sarah Blue Jeff Williams of architecture firm Perkins+Will and a project attorney according to a log from the meeting. Project representatives said a pedestrian connection going through Church Street to the BeltLine is also part of the plan.

QTS’s Westside Atlanta plans were first reported by the Atlanta Business Chronicle.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Paul Sutter history professor and series editor for Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books hosted the event which brought together three authors from across the nation to talk about their East Asian environmental history series.

Jakobina Arch associate history professor at Witman College introduced her 2018 book “Bringing Whales Ashore: Oceans and the Environment in Early Modern Japan.” The book focuses on the human relationship with whales in Japan as a piece of maritime history as well as on whaling in general which she feels that Japan’s environmental history tends to ignore.

“In fact during this period one of the things that happened was that they were running up the limits of terrestrial resources and had to focus on pulling in more oceanic resources and whaling groups are one of these” Arch explained.

Arch’s book offers an argument that whaling is not a sustainable way of obtaining resources and that cultural whaling often ignores historical and modern changes in the environment.

David Fedman a historian and associate professor of history at the University of California Irvine also explored the environmental history of Japan specifically its impact in Korea. His 2020 book titled “Seeds of Control: Japan’s Empire of Forestry in Colonial Korea” highlights Japan’s role in modern forestry efforts in Korea.

“For me this is a groundbreaking study of Japan’s early modern forestry. So part of what I’m trying to do is bring that story into the 20th century into the age of high imperialism and industrial capitalism” Fedman said.

Fedman recognized through his study that while a lot of Korean narratives recognized colonial Japan as destructive to the landscape of Korea Japan’s efforts in planting trees have been large in the past.

“The book at another level is trying to restore some complexity to the conversation of ecological legacies of colonial rule on the Korean peninsula” Fedman said.

Fedman emphasized the importance of responsibility in having conversations about the cost and benefits of large-scale forestation projects and the greenery of landscapes already belonging to people.

History professor Ian Miller of St. John’s University looked at forestry in China in his 2020 book “Fir and Empire: The Transformation of Forests in Early Modern China.” In it he refers to the state of forestry as mostly eurocentric and his book stresses the importance of China and East Asia as part of worldwide plantation forestry.

“In China this trend starts before 1492 and it starts outside of this Atlantic world context so it really calls into question what were some of the influence of some of the causes that led to people to start planting trees on a large scale” Miller explained.

The panelists discussed distinctive aspects of East Asian environmental studies compared to a more American view.

“East Asia was never as fully glaciated as a lot of other places in the northern hemisphere and so there are some species in particular plant species that survive… in East Asia that are not in other parts of the world” Miller said.

Through recognizing the differences in landscapes and environmental-climate history Miller stated that resources as well as their importance vary. This both directly and indirectly impacted the economic development and growth of much of East Asia.

“Forestry as practice in Korea is fundamentally different than that in Taiwan or the Philippines or the Manchurian taiga for that matter so for very obvious climatic reasons these things are differentiated” Fedman added.

Arch explained that there are different practices in environmental studies that vary across nations culturally.

“The way that we as Americans do environmental history is not the same as the way that historians operate in East Asia and therefore you might end up looking in other fields for the people doing what we think of this environmental history” Arch said.

Through doing this the panelists hope to share different lenses of environmental studies outside of a western viewpoint and broaden the reach of global environmental studies.

According to a recent report from consulting firm Willis Towers Watson employers expect nearly two in five employees will still be working remotely at the end of 2021 compared with 57 percent who work remotely now. Those numbers vary by industry of course.

So to see how many urban residents would take off for greener pastures should their job go full remote home renovation site CraftJack asked just that: Would you move anywhere if you could work remote?

According to their survey results 60 percent of Dallas-Fort Worth respondents would get the heck out of Dodge if they didn’t need to be in the Metroplex. Austin had the same proportion of residents that would pull up roots if they could but only 53 percent of Houstonians would make for the highway should opportunities arise.

That falls in line with a recent story from CNBC :

Before the Covid-19 outbreak only 7% of workers in the U.S. had access to a “flexible workplace” benefit or telework according to another report by the Pew based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ most recent National Compensation survey. Those workers were mostly managers white-collar professionals and highly paid. Of course not all workers have the ability to work from home even now. There’s a clear class divide between workers who can and cannot telework Pew also found.

Likewise the survey asked why a person would choose to move elsewhere. The top response was for a larger or better house though many people wanted a lower cost of living and better access to nature and open space. Other reasons for moving include proximity to family and friends more things to do a slower pace of life and better weather.

Interestingly enough Texas was seen as the trendiest state to move to with Austin being the trendiest city.

But if 60 percent of Dallas-Fort Worth respondents were ready to find new views where would they go? The top response really surprised me to be honest. Most Metroplex residents who were ready to move away should their work go remote full-time would move to …

Seattle.

That begged an interesting question with the people at CraftJack: Would you agree to be paid less if you went remote full time? And would you agree to be paid more to move to an undesirable location?

One curious trend that has emerged during the pandemic involves cities and states offering incentives for people to relocate. Notable examples include Tulsa OK and the state of Vermont each offering up to $10000. Given this we decided to ask people what it would take to compel them to a new location particularly one they’re not particularly fond of. Of those we surveyed 78 percent said they would need $100000 to move to a city they don’t really like and approximately one in four (23 percent) would need at least $250000. We also asked about the opposite scenario — what pay cut would people take to relocate to their most ideal spot? Most Americans (83 percent) would only take a 10-20 percent pay cut to make that move with 60 percent saying 10 percent would be the maximum they would tolerate. This brings up one of the most contentious debates around the future of remote work relocation and distributed workforces: should companies adjust salaries down — making what’s called a locality adjustment — when an employee moves from a more expensive area to a less expensive one? The answer from workers is a resounding no — 87 percent believe they should be paid the same amount they’re currently being paid no matter where they move.

What about you?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFuaW52ZXN0b3IubmV0L2FydGljbGUvY2hpbmFzLWVzZy1kaXNjbG9zdXJlLWltcHJvdmluZy1idXQtcmVndWxhdG9yeS1yaXNrLWEtY29uY2Vybi80NjkxMDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's ESG disclosure improving but regulatory risk a concern | ESG,"More of the country's firms have begun offering environmental social and governance data to investors but adoption remains low. Plus regulatory risk continues to offer uncertainty.

Environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) disclosure in China has gained momentum in recent years but data disclosure governance issues and regulatory risk need to further improve if the nation is to move in line with international standards according to a recent report published by Willis Towers Watson.

Global asset owners look set to continue providing this pressure as they further embrace ESG standards and demand that their external fund managers do so as well including in China.

The number of ESG reports published by China A-share companies and CSI 300 constituent firms increased from 1193 in 2009 to 1280 in 2020. But the report noted that this remains a low level given that only 25% of the 4000 A-share companies have published ESG data.

Liang Yin Willis Towers Watson

“Factors such as controlling shareholders (state-owned; founder-led) and a low level of ESG disclosure need addressing to help China move in line with global ESG best practices” Liang Yin China project lead at Willis Towers Watson and lead author of the report told AsianInvestor.

Still he is confident that China is catching up with the rest of the world and will continue to do so when mandatory ESG disclosure rules for all listed companies are eventually enforced.

There are no plans for mandatory ESG disclosures in China yet but President Xi Jinping said the country planned ""to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060"" at a virtual meeting of the UN General Assembly last September.

Most recently China barred fossil fuel projects from being applicable for green bond issues for which the country has become the leading issuer in the world. Chinese borrowers including banks property developers power generators and railway operators sold $15.7 billion of the bonds between January and March to fund ‘green’ projects such as clean and renewable energy according to Refinitiv data.

David Smith Aberdeen Standard Investments

REGULATORY PUSH

David Smith a senior investment director for Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments agrees that China could improve on ESG data disclosures and governance. But he believes the country's regulators are moving in the right direction.

“Disclosures are extremely inefficient in China compared with other markets [but with] national-level regulators’ support and push the ESG development is clearly going in a right way in the country” Smith told AsianInvestor.

However corporate governance in China ""has huge potential for improvement and given that the capital market of China is still going through a maturity and internationalisation stage the pick-up in governance improvement might take some time” Smith said.

The Willis Towers Watson report found that in terms of worldwide governance indicators China had improved in several areas namely rule of law (45.2% percentile) political stability (38.1% percentile) and government effectiveness (71.6% percentile). But they remained in the low percentile of 6.4% for voice and accountability. Regulatory quality and control of corruption also remained stagnant at around the 40% percentile.

China's engagement with ESG is becoming increasingly important to global asset owners who have embraced the principles. Many of these global institutional investors want to build their exposure to China's large and fast growing economy particularly as it gains more weighting in global benchmark indexes. But they want to do so in a manner consistent with their avowed commitments to sustainable investing.

This is sometimes easier said than done with political and regulatory risks in particular proving difficult to navigate at times.

The recent Ant Group saga in which the Chinese government halted its public listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong last year days before it was to proceed and slapped it with a $2.75 billion monopoly fine highlights the regulatory risk in the country.

Ant Group the financial affiliate company of tech giant Alibaba that was established by business tycoon Jack Ma was also asked to hand over its data to a state-controlled company to be run by former central bank officials.

Regulatory reform has been an integral part of China's economic reform for the past four decades and astute investors will need a firm handle on how it proceeds Liang said.

""The key to address this risk is having skilled asset management that understand the lay of the land” he highlighted adding that well-resourced local investor partners could help global institutions narrow their risk.

To attain higher efficiency in research work and a better grasp of localised ESG data and frameworks ""more asset owners have been willing to lean on local on-the-ground partners to access China’s vast capital market"" he observed.

OVERSEAS PLAYERS

Rebecca Fan Bosera AM

The pressure for local companies and fund managers to improve local ESG reporting looks set to continue. Domestic fund houses note that they have been increasingly asked by foreign institutional investors about their ESG considerations.

“We’ve received more ESG-related requests from overseas institutional investors last year and to be honest it is very difficult to secure a mandate from European investors if a fund is not equipped with a satisfactory ESG framework” said Rebecca Fan managing director at Bosera Asset Management.

Fan said some investors have enquired about how their portfolio compares with ESG weighted indices.

Jeremy Tai Harvest Fund

However more work needs to be done. Jeremy Tai global business manager at China-based Harvest Fund told AsianInvestor that local asset managers struggle to meet international standards.

“ESG in China is still in its early stages and local asset managers face the challenge of achieving the breadth and depth for a systematic ESG framework including data sourcing and scoring granularity' he said.

He tries to solve this by referring “to global ESG frameworks and focusing on localised issues and metrics in combination with insight from fundamental analysis” he said.",,,,,,,,,

""An opportunity to do something after being sheltered for such a long time during the quarantine of 2020"" said Justin.

Due to restaurant restrictions in early January they ordered room service. When they were done Justin says he took the tray outside.

Ambria did the same thing she does every night at home before going to bed.

""I take my rings my watch any jewelry and set it all in one spot.""

When she awoke the next morning she walked a few yards to the kitchen area where she'd left everything.

""I went to go put on my wedding ring and it's not there!""

""And that's when I noticed my stuff was gone too and I was like wait a minute where's my watch?!"" Justin added.

That was gone too. As was all their cash from the previous night. A $37000 loss according to the police report including their Rolex watches and Ambria's ring.

Right out from under their sleeping noses.

""Maybe I'm naive to think that in my own room when I'm going to sleep I'm safe but that's the expectation!"" said Ambria.

OTHER CRIME NEWS: Las Vegas police say thief targeting catalytic converters

In the police report a Wynn corporate investigator tells Las Vegas Metropolitan Police the room lock log showed the suite door was opened from the inside at approximately 1:49 a.m. which could mean the door was not shut all the way.

Justin says that's not the case. ""I had locked the French doors with a deadbolt. There wasn't one of those flip-over (latches) because of the style and design of the door.""

But there's no record of someone coming into the room from the outside.

""While in-room burglaries are not necessarily uncommon anywhere in the world no less on the Las Vegas Strip what I do find interesting is the manner in which they're getting into the rooms and the fact that people are actually still in their rooms"" said Security Expert Adam Coughran who spent 19 years as a police officer in Orange County CA with the tourist-oriented policing unit.

""And these types of crimes believe it or not we would see quite a bit what we commonly call 'door pushers' or folks just walking down hotel hallways pushing doors to see did they latch correctly? Were they locked right?""

That would be after a would-be thief was able to bypass layers of hotel security.

At the Encore Tower Suites Justin describes ""It's got a private access. You've got to have a key to get into that and then just to get to the elevators you've got to have another access key to get to the elevators and then to go up. So we thought that was a very very secure location.""

Their police report cites a second event with a similar M.O. that happened 10 minutes after their room was hit.

""When we do come across these types of crimes then we start keeping track of them to see if they're connected"" said LVMPD Lt. Jose Hernandez of the Convention Center Area Command. He said a connection is likely in this case based on the close timing of the two Jan. 2 crimes.

""The majority of these crimes are typically committed by suspects and not necessarily hotel staff"" Hernandez explained.

One exception: Jeff Berk. He and his wife stayed at the Encore in November 2017 when Carlos Valle worked there as a guest room attendant.

As detailed in court records Jeff explains how Valle ""Took one of the hotel keys that were our spare keys that we left in the room behind us and he took it to craft and plan and execute a crime days later.""

Valle and his accomplice Jesus Cervantes were both convicted of felony grand larceny to the tune of over $100000.

""What it says to guests is don't take the false comfort that there's a security level that can't be permeated"" said Berk.

Police are still investigating the Luettjohann's case and no one from the Wynn would go on camera.

Vice President of Security Investigations and Crisis Management Todd Fasulo wrote ""There is nothing more important to those of us who have worked to make Las Vegas an appealing tourist destination post-pandemic than guest safety. Creating a safe environment involves ensuring each suspected theft is reported to Metro. Because they handle criminal investigations they have all available information on suspects etc. We also conduct an internal investigation of all incidents and turn that information over to Metro as well. We routinely check room and suite doors to ensure that if the guest closes the door they shut properly.""

Coughran says there are ways around that.

""Number one you could have easily used an under-the-door tool -- essentially a tool that slides underneath the door that allows the door mechanism to be opened from the inside which would also bypass the deadbolt.""

He says thieves have also been known to electronically hack the door lock or take the simple route of renting a room themselves.

""And they spent hours on the floors over the course of the evening into the early morning hours committing crime.""

You might think with all the cameras in casinos these crimes should be easy to solve.

""Cameras in hospitality it's a fine balance between weighing the privacy of the guests weighing the security of the hotel but also weighing the liability and risk to the hotel"" says Coughran which is why most cameras are on the gaming floor in lobbies and elevator areas but likely not in hallways on the guest room floors.

We asked the Wynn about that and they said ""As a matter of practice we don’t publicly disclose the locations of our cameras or what areas are covered by them. Of course we assure our guests that their individual rooms for their privacy are not covered by cameras.""

13 Investigates has been tracking hotel room heists for years. After the Berks' case in 2017 at Encore a thief used a key card to break into a couple's hotel room at the Venetian in 2019 and stole $4000 worth of personal items.

And just last month a police report was filed by locals after a staycation at the Cosmopolitan. It details another alleged in-room theft while the guests were sleeping. Thieves reportedly stole their bag wallets credit and debit cards Apple watch and room key. According to the police report there's no video surveillance available.

The Cosmopolitan said in order to protect guest privacy they ""Do not comment on details surrounding an individual's stay.""

Nevada's Innkeeper statute says hotels are not liable for theft of any property a guest leaves in a room where they have access to a safe.

""We didn't put our stuff in the safe"" Justin said. ""We didn't. We felt that in a locked room while we're there was pretty darn secure in a very very secure -- in our opinion -- hotel room in Las Vegas.""

Jeff Berk sued the Wynn. His case ended up in arbitration where he got $25000 for emotional distress.

On the criminal side LVMPD says these investigations take time and often hinge on thieves pawning property they can trace back to the victim.

Lt. Hernandez suggests ""Take photos of your expensive valuable items. Take note of any serial numbers.""

Another way you can protect yourself while traveling Coughran advises is to ""Travel with the toddler alarms that you can hang on the door.""

Justin's taking it one step further.

""I'll probably going forward in staying places have to set up my own cameras internally in my room so I know what happens when I'm either not there or even when I'm sleeping.""

All the victims we spoke to hope their stories convince others to take safety into their own hands.

They say they won't come back to Las Vegas anytime soon because they feel the hotels are more concerned about protecting their reputation than their guests.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I czy pojawią się rozległe niedobory wody?

Debata o wodzie

Odpowiedzi na pytania o przyszłość wody na Ziemi poszukiwali prelegenci czwartkowej debaty o nazwie “Let’s Panic – chrońmy wodę dla przyszłych pokoleń”. Tematem przewodnim rozmów był globalny kryzys klimatyczny i związany z tym problem światowych wód. W spotkaniu uczestniczyli m.in. dr Sebastian Szklarek ekohydrolog PAN Rafał Jakimiak przedstawiciel Wód Polskich i Rafał Bonter prezes Xylem Water Solutions Polska. Wprowadzeniem do spotkania był fragment filmu “Można panikować” z udziałem prof. Szymona Malinowskiego polskiego fizyka atmosfery prof. nauk o Ziemi. Debatę poprowadził Szymon Bujalski dziennikarz zajmujący się kwestiami ekologii i ochrony środowiska. Rozmówcy debatowali o tym co może wkrótce czekać naszą planetę.

Susza i niedobory wody – problem świata i gospodarki

Susza jest zjawiskiem naturalnym i wywołuje ją długotrwały brak opadów. Trzeba jednak rozróżnić susze które powstają w wyniku naturalnych zjawisk w środowisku i te które są skutkiem działalności człowieka. Podwyższenie średniej temperatury powierzchni Ziemi czyli ocieplenie klimatu to skutek ludzkich działań. Przekształcanie przyrody wedle własnych potrzeb wpływa więc na cały ekosystem planety.

Przykładowo susza na danym obszarze może być spowodowana nadmiernym eksploatowaniem danego ujęcia wody które nie jest niewyczerpalne. W wyniku tego dany region cierpi na niedobór tego surowca a inny posiada go w nadmiarze. Ogromne ilości wody zużywają najbardziej wodochłonne gałęzie gospodarki w tym przemysł tekstylny oraz hodowlany. Uprawa bawełny w Kazachstanie i Uzbekistanie doprowadziła do stopniowego wyschnięcia Jeziora Aralskiego. Przez ponad 60 lat powierzchnia zmniejszyła się o ⅕.

Powódź

Oprócz zahamowania wzrostu roślin i niedoboru wody pitnej długotrwała susza może prowadzić do ryzyka powodzi. Przesuszona gleba nie może przyjąć dużej ilości wody co powoduje jej zbieranie się na powierzchni ziemi. Długie okresy susz wynikają ze zmian klimatycznych. Wody Polskie opracowały program “Stop suszy” który uwzględnia kroki przeciwdziałania jej skutkom. Podobny projekt prowadzą też inne państwa UE.

Zmiana klimatu – dlaczego ma miejsce?

Trzy mld ludzi na świecie cierpi z powodu niedoboru wody na terenach rolniczych. Dwa mld ludzi żyje na co dzień z niedoborem wody i nie ma dostępu do źródła wody pitnej.do jej czystego źródła. Przewiduje się że do 2030 roku 700 mln ludzi zostanie przesiedlonych z powodu braku dostępu do czystej wody.

Te niepokojące dane wynikają między innymi ze zmian klimatu a ich powodów jest wiele. Ekspresowe tempo urbanizacji rozwój gospodarki globalizacja napędzanie konsumpcyjnych nawyków czy wreszcie gonitwa za pieniędzmi. Profesor Szymon Malinowski nie ma wątpliwości czyże zmiana klimatu i inne problemy ludzkości powinny zostać rozwiązane za pomocą wspólnego porozumienia. Swoje niepokoje profesor wyraził także w filmie dokumentalnym “Można panikować” (2020 reż. Jonathan L. Ramsey).

(WYMT) - Not even dreary weather cold temperatures and gusty winds could stop Kentuckians from coming together to honor an icon.

“We have a day packed full of fun all about Colonel Sanders and the original Kentucky Fried Chicken which of course is one of our biggest claims to fame” Maggy Kriebel said.

The first-ever “Colonel Fest” in downtown tells the story of Colonel Harland Sanders while letting people have fun in the process.

“We have vendors on-site we have kids’ games video game mobile unit we had a magic show earlier” Kriebel said.

The event was so big that even the Colonel himself was a bit nervous.

“People here are so well-versed in the Colonel’s life you know I wanted to make sure I dotted all my I’s and crossed all my T’s” Henry Dowell who portrayed Sanders in a performance about his life said.

Dowell said that while the pandemic limited his ability to perform he basked in the chance to do so again.

“My last performance before the pandemic hit was at the original restaurant site there” Dowell said. “And so I’m happy to come back to Corbin for my first real performance outside the pandemic.”

The opportunity to tell a legendary story of a Kentucky great while entertaining kids is something Dowell could not pass up.

“That’s one of the reasons I like doing this is that you can relay a story of a man who was an entrepreneur and who didn’t take no for an answer” Dowell said. “And built something from absolute nothing.”

But a month after the service launched the coronavirus struck. Panera CEO Niren Chaudhary watched half of Panera’s sales evaporate within a week.

Chaudhary __ who joined the company in 2019 after a career at Yum Brands and Krispy Kreme __ said it was a frightening but invigorating time with no playbook to follow.

“Our mindset was how can we use this as a catalyst to become better and stronger and establish more trust with all of our important stakeholders?” Chaudhary said.

Chaudhary struck deals with CVS and Walmart who agreed to temporarily hire the 35000 employees Panera was forced to furlough. Within days Panera set up curbside service at half its 2300 locations. It started selling grocery staples like eggs and flour.

A year later Panera is profitable again Chaudhary said. It has rehired all its workers and is looking for more. The coffee service __ which offers unlimited coffee for $8.99 per month __ has 500000 subscribers.

Customer interactions have changed. Eighty-five percent now get carryout or delivery compared to 40% before the pandemic. So Panera is changing with them adding drive-thru lanes partnering with delivery companies and adding new services like catering virtual company events for employees working from home.

Chaudhary spoke with The Associated Press about the impact of the pandemic. His comments have been edited for length.

Q. What are some of the changes Panera made that are likely to remain even after the pandemic eases?

A. I think first and foremost health and safety for our associates and our customers and tangible proof points in the cafe that they are safe will be an ongoing requirement. Masks social distancing and some of that might change. But I think the desire to see frequent sanitization happening and a greater level of care around things being safe is going to be massively important. The second irreversible trend is the desire for ongoing convenience. It’s not that on-premise consumption would disappear but delivery rapid pickup curbside pickup and drive-thru those kinds of things are here to stay. A third irreversible trend that I see is technology. More than half of our sales __ $2 billion __ is now coming through e-commerce. More and more companies are going to innovate on that. How can we use geo fencing to identify where our customers are? How can we use mobile technology to create one-on-one relationships and more convenient interactions with our customers?

Q. Will the popularity of off-premise dining change the way Panera designs its stores?

A. Panera as we know and love we want to maintain that. But it will be a smaller version. It will have the fireplace. It will have the display of the bread and the bakery and everything that makes Panera so special. However we will redesign it for greater off-premise convenience. So I can imagine you will have separate rapid pickup access. You will have maybe two drive-thru lanes one for preorder and pickup.

Q. Like a lot of restaurants Panera streamlined its menu early in the pandemic to save money. But in October you added a completely new product: flatbread pizzas. What was the thinking behind that?

A. In the pandemic off-premise is where the tailwinds are. Delivery is growing 150% and the biggest daypart for delivery is evenings and weekends. Predominantly we have a lunch business but the evening __ during the pandemic in particular __ requires warm shareable meals to be consumed at home. We felt we had a gap but there was also a gap generally in the market of really high quality shareable flatbread pizzas that are affordable. So that is the reason it made sense.

Q. What are some of the things this past year has taught you?

A. One is resilience. When things appear to be overwhelmingly complicated and difficult the importance of focusing maniacally on only what you can do and not on the noise of what’s happening around you is terribly empowering. I would remind myself “Don’t worry about how long this will last or what’s going to happen. Worry about what you can do at Panera.” The second thing that gave me and the team emotional strength was leading with heart. Even if we did tough things do it with compassion with empathy and with respect. The third thing is this metaphor of windmills not bunkers. When there’s a storm that’s raging step back and say “How can I harness the fury of the storm by building a windmill of opportunity? How can we actually step up and use this as an opportunity and not dive into a bunker?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL21vc3QtcG9wdWxhci1wZWFudXQtYnV0dGVyLWJyYW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Most Popular Peanut Butter Brands — Eat This Not That,"As jelly's significant other and a friend to apples and bananas peanut butter is a beloved staple in many American pantries. Because it's one of those snacks many people enjoy from childhood onward many families have a specific brand texture and flavor they prefer.

Curious about which ones top the charts (and fulfill appetites)? Statista conducted a survey to determine the most beloved peanut butter brands. By working with the United States Census and Simmons National Consumer Survey they asked households one question: ""Which brands of peanut butter have you eaten most in the last 30 days?"" The data was published in November 2020 so this includes the brands of peanut butter customers leaned on during the pandemic.

Here are the survey's findings on the most popular brands of peanut butter in the United States with #1 being the country's most popular peanut butter. It's a classic for a reason!

And if you're wondering how our taste compares to the rest of the nation We Tested 10 Peanut Butters and This Is the Best!

Jif

When it comes to tradition Jif is about as classic American as you can buy. It's been sitting pretty on pantry shelves since 1956 and it still ranks the highest in the country today. According to the study's findings 117.31 million folks consumed Jif in 2020 alone.

While creamy and crunchy peanut butter varieties are typically the go-tos of Jif fans the company has recently released even more nut butter options including almond butter and hazelnut spreads allowing them to remain competitive in the industry.

Skippy

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Believe it or not Skippy has been in grocery stores even longer than Jif starting in 1933 smack-dab in the middle of the Great Depression. While the company has gone through plenty of ebbs-and-flows over many decades it remains a contender for PB-loving families.

Data from the survey found an estimated 85.98 million people are Team Skippy. With snack packs and natural options they could be a solid solution for busy parents who need a quick fix for a hanger tantrum stat.

Store Brand

In the Statista survey 52.17 million people picked ""store brand"" a blanket term for anything sold by grocery chains. This includes Whole Foods 365 Target's spreads and Trader Joe's peanut butter varieties. It makes sense why this sector of sales would rank third in popularity as it's usually less expensive and more practical for budget-mindful households.

Peter Pan

Lost boys and imaginative children alike choose Peter Pan the original peanut butter brand founded in 1928. More than 90 years later it's still the fourth-ranking choice among Americans at 45.15 million strong according to the survey. Perhaps it's the creamy spread the crunchy bite or the plethora of options that make folks feel like they're flying to never-never-yum-land when they lick their spoons.

Nutella

We hate to be the ones to break this to the 38.91 million people who picked Nutella as their favorite peanut butter formula but um it's not actually PB. It's made of hazelnuts and cocoa powder giving it an irresistible dessert-like taste.

Though there's no denying Nutella (and its many store brand knockoffs) has a cult-like following for those looking for a high-protein snack this may not be the right choice. A serving of Nutella has just two grams of protein which is less than you'd find in traditional peanut butter.

Smucker's

Fun fact: Smucker's was founded as a jelly and jam company in 1897 making it the oldest contender in the survey. As they grew they expanded to include peanut butter and eventually the PB&J-in-one-jar ""Goober"" combo. The J.M. Smucker Company owns Jif too so it's no wonder the famous jelly landed on this list.

Though we're not sure what type of Smucker's product the 19.96 million Americans have in their home it's safe to say that this brand has major staying power.

The easy way to make healthier comfort foods.

Hershey's

Another brand that's more of a sweet treat than a traditional hearty peanut butter spread is Hershey's. The well-known chocolatier has a variety of candy-inspired selections including Reese's. It's the top pick for 13.44 million people which just goes to show how many chocolate lovers there are in the United States.

Planters

When the Planters name started circulating around the country people couldn't get enough of the brand's salty peanuts in the shell. As business boomed so did their product selection prompting the company to introduce peanut butter in the 1950s.

Today Planters is known for having a saltier taste than other brands which is just what 7.1 million Americans appreciate according to the survey's findings.

Smart Balance

As the only all-natural option to make the list Smart Balance came in with 5.85 million supporters. It's a solid protein choice and it tastes just as delicious as its competitors.

Whatever peanut butter brand you're loyal to you're sure to be in good company. And if you prefer a peanut butter brand that's off the beaten path that just makes your choice all the more unique.",,,,,,
